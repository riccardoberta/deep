The same mid-ship section has been analysed from different students of the naval architecture course. Results are analysed in a statistical way and conclusions are drawn from the fluctuations in the results.",

      "abstract": "In the last years, an increasing attention has been devoted to ships Underwater Radiated Noise (URN), with the progressive introduction of noise reduction Guidelines by international organizations such as IMO, Classification Societies voluntary notations, limits and incentives in specific areas. In this context, a large effort has been spent in the study of cavitating propeller noise since it represents the dominating noise source on ships. Over the years, the University of Genoa has developed strategies for propeller design by optimisation aimed to the reduction of cavitation and noise as a side effect, limiting possible negative consequences on the propulsion efficiency. In the context of the EU-funded LIFE-PIAQUO project it was possible to perform a complete optimisation activity, starting from a real test case (a small passenger boat operating in Mediterranean marine protected areas) and retrofitting the propellers for dedicated sea trials. The present paper reports the main results of these activities, highlighting the capability of the proposed methods, through a comparative full-scale validation of the outcomes of the design activity.",

      "abstract": "The noise radiated by ship propellers can be studied by analyzing scaled models in a cavitation tunnel. However, transferring the measurements made in the enclosed space of the tunnel to the expected values in a full-scale propeller (in a free field) presents a challenge for noise measurements. An acoustic characterization of the DITEN cavitation tunnel, including a study of normal modes and acoustic response to harmonic sources, is presented to understand the primary acoustic behaviour of the enclosure and its propagation characteristics. A three-dimensional numerical model was developed to simulate the DITEN Genoa University cavitation tunnel and evaluate the influence of elements such as a dynamometer, fins, impeller, and source position on the acoustic response of the tunnel. The study showed the influence of the mentioned elements on the acoustic response of the tunnel, and the numerical predictions were validated by comparing them with the experimental campaign in the low-mid frequency range. The study provides valuable insights into the behaviour of sound waves in a cavitation tunnel and the influence of various factors, which can help design and optimize cavitation tunnels and related experiments.",

      "abstract": "In addition to a number of other forms of environmental impact by shipping activities, airborne noise radiated by ships, too, has come to the attention of Regulatory Bodies in the latest years. The presence of strong acoustic sources on board, and the proximity of the port to inhabited zones represent the main technical aspect of the problem. To meet the demand for control of the airborne noise radiated by a ship, in 2019, the Lloyd's Register issued a class notation on airborne noise emissions by ships, setting a procedure for awarding this notation. Numerical models for the prediction of airborne noise propagation represents a favorable element for the evaluation and control of the airborne acoustical impact. This paper reports the application of this additional class notation and its effectiveness in characterizing the noise field radiated by a cruise ship. The performances of different software in terms of the reproduction of the noise field radiated by a ship and with specific reference to the predicted levels at normative reference distances have been carried out. Results shows the potentiality of this type of approach and first interesting conclusions as regard the radiated airborne noise from a large cruise ship.",

      "abstract": "Electric boats are thought to be noiseless, but in-situ measurements are generally rare. The Underwater Radiated Noise (URN) of 8-m Trimaran Pontoon Boat with two outboard electric engines was measured in the Miramare Marine Protected Area (Trieste, Italy), together with the URN of a fibreglass 5-m boat, with a outboard gasoline engine, for comparisons. International standards and guidelines for shallow waters were considered. URN were provided in one-third octave band and in narrow band spectra. The electric boat produced a low input of underwater noise at low frequencies. Given a low-frequency hearing sensitivity, the listening space reduction (LSR) was lower when generated by the electric than by combustion engine boat for the brown meagre, a local Teleost fish. No difference was found for the bottlenose dolphin LSR although continuous, tonal, high frequency components generated by the electric boat are expected to be highly detrimental for the bottlenose dolphin.",

      "abstract": "The airborne noise emitted by ships represents a pollution source affecting the surrounding environment and third parties. Nowadays, in addition to numerous other kinds of environmental impacts due to shipping activities, ship airborne radiated noise in the latest years has captured the attention of universities, industries, and Regulatory Bodies. Even though this problem can be quite annoying and has raised serious complaints from the citizens of areas close to ports, shipping routes along the coast, or inland waters, the acoustic impact of ships to date has not been subjected to systematic control. The problem is primarily driven by the presence of powerful sound sources on ships and the fact that inhabited areas are often in close proximity to areas where ships operate. In response to the need to regulate the noise emitted by ships, Lloyd's Register introduced a class notation in 2019 specifically for airborne noise emissions from ships. This notation also includes a procedure for granting the notation. Within this context, the development of mathematical models to predict the propagation of noise in the air can serve as a valuable tool for anticipating and controlling the impact of ship-related airborne noise. This paper, reports problems and methods on the practical implementation of the required classification checks, in particular as regards the simulation and validation problems. As an application example, a small part of the results obtained during an industrial research activity aimed at assessing the noise radiated into the air by a passenger ship is reported.",

      "abstract": "Understanding the specific characteristics of onboard noise can significantly benefit human activity in different kinds of ships. Here, the perceived noise can significantly change from space to space in terms of both levels and frequency content, depending on location onboard in respect to the primary sources and on propagation paths. Moreover, secondary sources as ventilation systems contribute to generate a complex soundscape for each ship. In this work, noise spectra reported in the literature were collected and analyzed to obtain an overview of the noise characteristics in different spaces onboard military and commercial vessels, i.e. accommodation, navigation bridge, and other workspaces. A prevalence of high noise levels in the different spaces that can be over the commonly accepted limits was found, characterized by higher levels at low and high frequencies. Different noise indexes not yet adopted in this sector were tested on the data to derive more information about onboard noise annoyance. Supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms were also applied to qualitatively classify and study the collected spectra. The analysis shows the presence of different spectral typologies, i.e. balanced spectral shapes (quasi-linear decay of the noise level per octave band with no dominant frequency components) or unbalanced ones.",

This work aims to present a modal acoustic characterization of the cavitation tunnel of the DITEN department of the University of Genoa in the low-frequency zone (i.e., below 1 kHz). A three-dimensional numerical model was used to simulate the tunnel, helping to understand the enclosure's modal behavior. Normal modes were classified using the modes for a toroidal-like enclosure. As expected, the modal density increases for each third-octave band, making it possible to determine the frequency limit where the behavior of the tunnel changes from modal to diffuse.",

Here the Underwater Radiated Noise (URN) of seven recreational and small fishing boats moving at two different speeds was measured in the shallow waters of the Cres-Lošinj Natura 2000 SCI (Croatia). Measurements were undertaken considering the internationally recognized standards and published guidelines for shallow waters. URN was provided in 1/3 octave band spectra and in narrow band spectra, to highlight the tonal components. Engine power and type rather than the boat length and design result to be more predictive of URN. Highest speeds induce highest noise levels only in a very limited frequency range and different boats with similar speed but different engines show a shift in the spectra. Relevance of the achieved results for the tested area is further discussed.",

      "abstract": "Airborne port noise has historically suffered from a lack of regulatory assessment compared to other transport infrastructures. This has led to several complaints from citizens living in the urban areas surrounding ports, which is a very common situation, especially in countries facing the Mediterranean sea. Only in relatively recent years has an effort been made to improve this situation, which has resulted in a call for and financing of numerous international cooperation research projects, within the framework of programs such as EU FP7, H2020, ENPI-CBC MED, LIFE, and INTERREG. These projects dealt with issues and aspects of port noise, which is an intrinsically tangled problem, since several authorities and companies operate within the borders of ports, and several different noise sources are present at the same time. In addition, ship classification societies have recently recognized the problem and nowadays are developing procedures and voluntary notations to assess the airborne noise emission from marine vessels. The present work summarizes the recent results of research regarding port noise sources in order to provide a comprehensive database of sources that can be easily used, for example, as an input to the noise mapping phase, and can subsequently prevent citizens’ exposure to noise.",

      "abstract": "The worldwide increase in ship traffic poses a series of challenges for the designer, the crew and the authorities involved in ship traffic management. Depending on the ship type, both onboard comfort and safety represent two key aspects to be taken into account during the ship life. In the present paper, the focus is on the assessment of the safety and comfort in service during navigation in real weather conditions by focusing on an entire route instead of on a single ship. A method for assessing the safety and comfort levels of specific routes is presented and discussed in the paper. In particular, a statistical approach to set up limit thresholds able to quantify the level of navigation safety and comfort for different ship types in a specific area is presented based on historical weather data. The method is based on the Automatic Identification System (AIS) data for the traffic characterization, a strip theory for the seakeeping calculations and historical meteorological data for the environment definition for a specific area in the Mediterranean Sea.",

      "abstract": "Maritime transport for both passengers and freight is continuously increasing and, consequently, the global attention toward its sustainability is growing. Ships offer advantages in terms of environmental impact compared to other transportation systems but the increasing traffic volume is expected to increase pollutants. Noise produced in port areas has been neglected for too long, until the INTERREG Maritime programme Italy-France 2014–2020 has brought to light how citizen complaints are emerging for some of the main ports in the Mediterranean. However, port noise prevention and management is difficult as knowledge on specific sources is very limited in the literature. Furthermore, on field measurements are difficult to be performed given the complexity of the port area, where multiple types of sound emitters mix and confuse each other. Noise maps represent the first important step in order to align ports to the requirements set by the Environmental Noise Directive to the transportation infrastructures. Once computed, they are an excellent tool supporting port management towards the reduction of citizens’ noise exposure while ensuring traffic growth. The present paper reports a guideline for the characterization of noise sources needed as inputs for the noise maps, as developed in the framework of the INTERREG Maritime programme Italy-France 2014–2020. On the basis of the current state of the art, a procedure has been elaborated for different categories of noise sources acting in port, ranging from stationary to moving ships, from mooring operations to loading/unloading operations, from industrial activities to road and railway traffic.",

      "abstract": "The time-dependent spectral characteristics of underwater sound radiated by an oceanic vessel have complex dependencies on ship machinery, propeller dynamics, and the hydrodynamics of the ship exhaust and motion, as well as onboard activities. Here, the underwater sound radiated by a ship equipped with a controllable pitch propeller (CPP) is analyzed and quantified via its (i) power spectral density for signal energetics, (ii) temporal coherence for machinery tonal sound, and (iii) spectral coherence for propeller amplitude-modulated cavitation noise. Frequency-modulated (FM) tonal signals are also characterized in terms of their frequency variations. These characteristics are compared for different propeller pitch ratios, ranging from 20% to 82% at a fixed number of propeller revolutions per minute (RPM). The efficacy and robustness of ship parameter estimation at different pitches are discussed. Finally, an analysis of one special measurement is provided: propeller pitch and RPM over the duration of the measurement when the ship changes speed. The 50% pitch was found to be a crucial point for this ship, around which the tonal characteristics of its underwater radiated sound attain their peak values while broadband sound and associated spectral coherences are at a minimum. The findings here elucidate the effects of pitch variation on underwater sound radiated by ships with controllable pitch propellers and has applications in ship design and underwater noise mitigation.",

The main aim of this study is to identify key points in the application of an acoustic camera to the characterization of port noise. An experimental campaign was carried out in the seaport of Genoa. Based on this experience, a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) analysis was performed. The experimental results confirm the intrinsic complexity of the noise field in ports. Several noise sources were identified and can be categorized by their duration, intensity, location and spectral content; the analysis performed allows us to propose a basic framework for the innovative application of this technique to the port noise context. Acoustic cameras can be considered viable and useful tools to characterize and monitor port noise, following at least the minimum key points highlighted in the proposed framework.",

      "abstract": "The impact of underwater radiated noise (URN) by ship traffic has gained an increasing interest among scientists, ship designers and builders. It is now recognized that the underwater noise generated by human activities and in particular shipping noise can be harmful for the marine fauna and therefore urgent actions must be taken to tackle the problem. To this aim a virtuous example is represented by the Port Authority of Vancouver (CA) that, since 2017, has introduced important incentives and tax relief for those ships that prove to be particularly virtuous in terms of noise emissions radiated into the water. Up to now, most of the attention has been paid to study and characterize the noise emissions of large commercial ships due their worldwide diffusion. To this aim several measurements protocols have been issued both by international bodies (ISO, ANSI/ASA) both by the main classification societies. A lack of data is on the contrary present regarding pleasure crafts both as regards small boast and large yachts. In the present paper data coming from an experimental campaign for the measurement of the underwater radiated noise of one large yacht built by the SanLorenzo shipyards is presented. Noise has been measured for several operative conditions and speeds ranging from zero to maximum speed.",

      "abstract": "Onboard ship noise represents a complex issue due to the interaction of different contributions such as engines, propellers, HVAC systems, and several propagation pathways throughout the ship structure from these sources to the various occupied spaces. Resonances can occur and strongly affect the acoustical comfort into closed spaces, particularly into cabins used to rest by the crew or passengers. Four different cabin geometries from a real passenger vessel have been simulated using 3D FEM techniques in order to obtain the modal response of each enclosure at low frequencies. The density of the modal frequencies was obtained for each space. Some of those frequencies could cause annoyance and could be caused by the engines or the propellers of the ship. The presence of high acoustic pressure zones in sensible locations of the cabins is evident in all the considered geometries. This approach can represent a valuable tool at design or retrofitting stages to achieve the best possible comfort levels by adopting control measures depending on each cabin geometry.",

      "abstract": "Inspection is a key aspect of any structural maintenance programme, including that of ship and offshore structures with a long-lasting history of service failures. Ship surveys for construction, verification, repair and conversion are intrinsically hazardous that are mainly performed by human surveyors. The ROBINS project (ROBotics technology for INspection of Ships) is an EU Horizon 2020 collaborative project aimed at addressing possible advantages of robotic technologies for ship inspections and facing corresponding challenges. Within the project framework, gaps and drawbacks in the application of robotic technologies were identified, from both technological and regulatory viewpoints. Solutions were suggested and developed through laboratory and field trials. Results indicate that cost-effective robotic assistants can be successfully introduced in the marine structure maintenance routine, if appropriate assessments of technologies and application procedures are carried out in advance according to validation schemes, such as the standard verification process recommended in this paper.",

The overall noise inside cabins is first evaluated, then the effect of HVAC (Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning) is investigated and several criteria, typical from the civil field (Noise Criterion, Room Criterion, etc.), are applied and compared. The effect of different operative conditions in terms of revolutions per minute of engines, propellers and generators, of propeller pitch and of engine power is investigated as well, highlighting the differences in terms of measured noise and of indicators performances. The results of the study suggest that the current normative framework and regulations about noise on board ships, based on dB(A) limits only, could effectively be revised to take into account spectral components, whose effect would otherwise be neglected.",

Adoption of Robotics and Autonomous Systems (RAS) in activities related to ship inspections has obvious potential advantages, but also arises particular challenges, both from technical and legal viewpoints.

Main goal of the present work is to highlight how ship inspections are currently carried out by humans, how they could be improved using RAS, even if not completely autonomous for the time being, at least in selected operational scenarios and how the performances of RAS platforms can be tested to assess their effectiveness in carrying out surveys onboard. In such a framework, a testing facility aimed at assessing RAS' capabilities as well as providing suitable environment for their development has been built and it is still under development along with dedicated testing protocols, able to assess the equivalence between human and RAS inspection of ship and marine structures. The features of a testing facility where RAS can be tested and the testing protocols are presented, showing how technological and regulatory gaps are filled.",

      "abstract": "The intense maritime traffic of modern days requires that a considerable attention be paid toward the comfort of ships not only as design criteria, but also as a means of assessing the quality of navigation in service conditions. Certain passenger routes and ship dimensions are more vulnerable than others to rough weather and the current climate changes require adaptation of design and navigation warning strategies. The main aim of the paper is to describe a method to derive a probabilistic representation of the comfort of passengers and crew on a selected route. AIS data is used to identify and characterise the chosen route. The seakeeping properties of the principal ships are evaluated employing a strip theory code. Detailed wave hindcast data is then employed to build state-of-the-art wave scatter diagrams along the route which allow the calculation of the ship responses for each sea state and the associated probability. The Motion Sickness Incidence is finally used as a comparative measure of the overall on-board comfort experienced on a variety of passenger vessels.",

      "abstract": "Merchant vessels experience regular structural assessments. Traditionally, surveys are performed physically by surveyors being expansive and time-consuming. Imagery based, cracks recognition is a topic obtaining considerable interest in commercial and scientific sectors. By using computer vision algorithms, authors propose a new approach to expedite crack detection, visualize the cracks efficiently in ship structures and then measure their length. The process includes two parts: at first, crack images are captured manually by using low-cost handheld cameras. Afterward, image is imported into software and processed. To make analysis easier, image is compressed and converted into grayscale. Image contrast is then stretched to enhance the contrast between background and crack. After obtaining latent crack identification features, images are elaborated by pre-processing, feature extraction, image segmentation, thus estimating the region of interest and determining whether the image includes a crack or not. Based on experiments and comparing results to traditional naked-eyes approaches, the algorithm is found efficient in crack detection, hence reducing cost and making crack identification system more portable, accurate and integrated.",

      "abstract": "The impact of noise generated by harbour actives gained a very important role in the last years. While the evaluation of the noise impact of industrial plants and transportation is fully integrated in the activities of noise mapping in urban areas, a lack of regulation exists regarding the activities carried out in ports. The complaints of citizens living close to the harbours pushed the authorities to face the problem. In this context several EU Interreg Maritime research projects have been launched in last few years. Each project is focused on a specific aspect of the problem, but all of them have in common the implementation of a network of sensors aimed to the monitoring of the noise for long periods of time. Such monitoring activity will generate a huge amount of data that must be collected, integrated and stored in a proper database in order to be accessed in a second time. The data can then be used for the management of the harbour (e.g.: by changing the docking position of ships) or to support the decision making in terms of mitigation strategies. In this paper possible ways of storing and managing the data will be described.",

      "abstract": "Harbour noise is an issue that in these last years is subject of a research effort financed by the European Union by means of several Programmes, such as FP7, ENPI CBC Med, LIFE and the Interreg Maritime. Within the framework of this last one, six different projects were financed, forming a cluster regarding port noise nuisance. The deep interconnection of the projects, and the efficent networking activities carried out between them, led to interesting findings and strategies in order to tackle the problems that are related with the noise impact of port activities on the surrounding residential areas. In particular, measurement campaigns conducted within the DECIBEL project in the ports of Portoferraio, Isola del Giglio and Olbia clearly showed that noise issues for small ports which do not have cargo handling are definitely different from the ones that affect the largest ports. The main and most disturbing noise sources in these realities are different, and thus are different also the actions that have to be taken in order to deal with the sound pollution they produce. The analysis of the data collected led to the conclusion that customized solutions must be adopted for every small port considered, taking also into account possible environmental and legislative constraints that are often present in small realities that sometimes can even be part of natural parks or ecologically restricted areas.",

      "abstract": "Ships condition is assessed regularly to maintain safety. Traditionally, structural integrity assessment is performed by surveyors, requiring complex and time-consuming operations to accessany ship space. Imagery based, three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of structures is a new area obtaining considerable interest. It can provide low-cost, less disruptive and safer inspection approach. In this study, alternative technologies to generate 3D models, based on photos, are explored. The aim is to highlight how human made ship survey can be improved using robotics technology. A procedure for 3D reconstruction combining photogrammetry/videogrammetry and computer vision techniques is developed, providing an alternative to ease vessel inspections. Moreover, effect of pre-processing image datasets, aimed at improving the performance of 3D reconstruction, is investigated. An efficient image pre-processing pipeline based on computer vision algorithms for colour enhancement, shadow removal and image blurriness is presented. This study can help in effective and reliable decision-making process, due to its user-friendliness and cost effectiveness, mainly for cargo holds requiring frequent assessment because of cargo operations induced damages.",

      "abstract": "This paper deals with the estimate of uncertainties affecting still water hull girder loads of bulk and dry cargo ships. In strength assessment of ships, two main categories of acting loads are considered: still water loads and wave induced ones. While the latter are generally defined bearing in mind their stochastic nature, this is not the case for still water loads, which are basically deterministically considered. The underlying assumption is that there is an overall control of the operational profile during the service of a ship. However, this is not the case in actual fact, especially for general dry cargo ships and bulk carriers, since the loading/unloading process cannot be fully controlled by the crew, often resulting into loading conditions rather different from those planned by the designer. Based on an earlier work, where loading conditions of the above-mentioned ship types were statistically analyzed, in the present paper Monte Carlo simulations are used to estimate the uncertainties affecting the hull girder still water loads of ships in service, showing that their allowable values can be exceeded due to inaccuracies in ship and cargo management.",

      "abstract": "Achieving a reliable and accurate numerical prediction of the self-propulsion performance of a ship is still an open problem that poses some relevant issues. Several CFD methods, ranging from boundary element methods (BEM) to higher-fidelity viscous Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) based solvers, can be used to accurately analyze the separate problems, i.e. the open water propeller and the hull calm water resistance. However, when the fully-coupled self-propulsion problem is considered, i.e. the hull advancing at uniform speed propelled by its own propulsion system, several complexities rise up. Typical flow simplifications adopted to speed-up the simulations of the single analysis (hull and propeller separately) lose their validity requiring a more complex solver to tackle the fully-coupled problem. The complexity rises up further when considering a maneuver condition. This aspect increases the computational burden and, consequently, the required time which becomes prohibitive in a preliminary ship design stage. The majority of the simplified methods proposed in literature to include propeller effects, without directly solve the propeller flow, in a high-fidelity viscous solver are not able to provide all the commonly required self-propulsion coefficients. In this work, a new method to enrich the results from a body force based approach is proposed and investigated, with the aim to reduce as much as possible the computational burden without losing any useful result. This procedure is tested for validation on the KCS hull form in self-propulsion and maneuver conditions.",

      "abstract": "In the North Tyrrhenian sea, port noise affects the development of harbour cities on both French and Italian coasts. Tourism, goods transportation and passenger traffic are increasingly limited by noise impact on port cities, which annoys residents and disturbs the sleep of the exposed population. Therefore, the EU has promoted a coordinated action to control and reduce port noise in the area through the IT-FR Maritime programme, with an investment of more than 11 M Euros. Organisations and public institutions from Tuscany, Sardinia, Corsica, Liguria and PACA are sharing this ambitious programme aiming to harbour noise control. Six projects have been funded to develop a recovery strategy and promote collaboration between port stakeholders. REPORT, RUMBLE, MONACUMEN, DECIBEL, LIST and TRIPLO are all projects covering different aspects of port noise in the framework of a coordinated policy over a specific area of the Mediterranean Sea. Each project addresses a specific goal, in accordance with an overall coordinated strategy: RUMBLE deals with large commercial ports, DECIBEL with small touristic harbours, LIST with noise from traffic generated by the ports, MONCUMEN with measurements and characterisation, REPORT with modelling and impact prediction, TRIPLO with reaction of the exposed population. The outcomes of these projects are expected to create a decisive turning point, both at territorial and technical level, with relevant benefits for the eligible area of the Maritime IT-FR programme and, more in general, for the whole of Europe.",

      "abstract": "The subject of port noise is increasingly gaining attention due to the higher number of complaints from people living in the nearby urban areas. Moreover, unlike other kinds of transport noise, such as the one due to railways, airports or roads, the current normative framework in this sector is lacking a proper structure and is in general inadequate. Aim of this paper is to analyze the state of the art and, in particular, the available instrumentation and technologies that can be adopted in the field of harbor noise monitoring. In addition, the main norms and standards related to this topic will be summarized in order to establish which conditions are required for a proper evaluation of the port noise impact on the surrounding urban areas. New features of monitoring instruments and innovative measurement techniques that can successfully be applied to the port noise will be reviewed, in order to identify the best way to characterize the acoustic emissions of the various complex different sources typically present in harbors, and to achieve the goal of a proper and effective monitoring system that can be adopted to control noise in ports and its impact on the inhabitants living in its close proximity",

Data from two apparently separate types of analysis, based on logistics and naval architecture, are merged within an integrated logistics-fleet design framework. The procedure carries out a preliminary screening of the design space based on logistics criteria. Then, possible fleet configurations and ship designs are investigated, providing information to shipyards and ship owners for an effective selection of optimal solutions. Interactions between logistics evaluations and classic ship design assessments are highlighted. Results from a realistic test case concerning compressed natural gas transportation are presented and discussed.",

      "abstract": "Classic hydrodynamics-related ship design problems can nowadays be approached by CFD viscous solvers. Ship self-propulsion performance prediction represents one of the most interesting problems in this framework. The capabilities of CFD codes to resolve accurately the separate problems (open water propeller performance and hull resistance) have been demonstrated over the last decades. The complexity of the combined problem (and, in turn, the required computational time) has restricted its solution to research applications still far from everyday industrial practice. Some approaches have been developed to reduce the computational burden, based e.g. on simple actuator-disk theory or, recently, on BEM/RANS coupled solvers. In this respect, different approaches exploiting the open-source solver Open-FOAM are presented, focusing on the main self-propulsion parameters. In addition, a new numerical strategy able to provide more information compared to classical simplified approaches, is herein presented and validated against experimental measurements on the well-known Kriso Container Ship (KCS) test case.",

      "abstract": "The recent concern about the impact of underwater noise emitted by ships, pushed national and international bodies to face the problem of setting limits to ship noise emission. In order to set new limits, a deep knowledge of the three elements of the noise chain (i.e. source, transmission path and receiver) is needed. In this context it is therefore important to measure the acoustic signature of a ship, in order to characterize it as noise source. To this aim, dedicated measurements may be carried out during sea trials, which usually takes place in an area close to the building shipyard. The measurement layout foresees a series of hydrophones deployed in the water column placed at a distance of a hundred metres from the ship that passes abeam the hydrophones on a straight course. Such far field measurements are to be referred to the reference distance of 1 metre in order to ensure results comparability. Sound propagation from the ship to the hydrophones is therefore to be carefully taken into account also considering the fact that measurements are carried out in a continuously changing environment. In the present paper, an experimental technique to characterise the environment frequency response function is presented together with results of its onsite application.",

      "abstract": "In the last decade, a number of new technologies has been developed to investigate the ocean environment by measuring different types of parameters among which ambient noise represents an important piece of information. The need for silent and autonomous vehicles moved the attention of scientist in the employment of underwater gliders as well as wave gliders. The reduced dimensions and the relatively easy layout adaptation of such vehicles make them particularly suited for carrying out different missions. Each new maritime unmanned system (MUS) configuration has to be tested in order to characterize the vehicle self-noise and its interaction with the measured data. The low costs and the small dimensions often give the possibility of facing problems with a trial and error approach slightly changing the layout in order to suppress possible noise sources. In the present paper the low-frequency acoustic data, sampled from the hydrophones positioned on a volumetric array in the aft part of the towfish of a waveglider, were not usable due to significant self-noise. To identify the noise source, a systematic analysis of the initial configuration have been carried out in two different phases. At first, the acoustic as well as the motion data coming from sea trials have been processed in order to highlight the critical operative conditions. In the second part, CFD calculations presented in order to identify the unwanted self-noise sources. Finally, a possible improvement is suggested based on numerical CFD calculations.",

The fluid characteristics are computed by using two Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods, namely a Unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (URANSE) method and a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) solver. Based on the CFD results, the structure response is calculated by means of a Finite Element Method (FEM). Different level of accuracy are explored in the CFD computations, i.e. varying the mesh and particle resolutions for the URANSE and the SPH, respectively. The study is performed on a selected test case, namely a reinforced wedge-like section falling into the water. Results are discussed in the light both of the comparison between the two CFD methods and in terms of global and local structural properties.",

      "abstract": "This paper reports a study on the uncertainties in assessing loading conditions of handy size bulk carriers. Loading conditions and the corresponding hull girder still-water loads are important for the safety of bulk carriers. Unfortunately, statistical studies on this topic remain very few, partly because of the difficulty in fully understanding the impact of loading/unloading operation process and partly because of intrinsic uncertainties in measuring cargo loading conditions data. Three handy-size bulk carriers were investigated and their actual loading conditions, spanning several voyages in 22 months, were collected. Statistical analyses of the collected data resulted in an estimate of the uncertainties in the loading/unloading process. Based on these analyses, probability distribution models for weights in cargo holds, water ballast tanks, fuel tanks as well as consumable tanks are proposed best fitting the collected data; hull girder still water loads statistical distributions are also obtained. It is expected that these analytical models can be used in structural reliability analyses that require the definition of uncertainties of loading conditions and of resulting still water loads.",

      "abstract": "A growing attention has been recently devoted to the impact of the underwater noise field generated by shipping activities on the marine fauna. A key aspect for the quantification of such impact is a proper model of the source levels radiated from the vessels. At a first level of approximation, simplified formulations based on a small number of macroparameters describing the ship characteristics are needed to quantify the emission and, accordingly, assess the noise impact and evaluate strategies for its control. In fact, a few models of this kind are available in the literature, mainly based on measurements and databases developed for military purposes. Most of these models have been tuned on old ships: this poses the question whether they are still applicable to modern commercial vessels. In this work, spectra of a series of measurements of underwater noise emitted by commercial vessels measured in the framework of two EU FP7 projects (SILENV: www.silenv.eu and AQUO: www.aquo.eu) are analyzed and compared with the results obtained applying the available literature models. The analysis is carried out for noise emitted both at design and off-design conditions. In such conditions, the models are also compared with a proposed spectral parametrization. Focusing on the off-design conditions, a detailed narrow band analysis of a complete set of noise spectra is presented for a ship equipped with a controllable pitch propeller (CPP). The spectral peculiarities of such a propulsion plant, when operated at constant revolutions per minute (RPM) are highlighted. Results of the suggested parametrization applied to the same ship are presented together with the data of other CPP ships and a critical analysis is carried out discussing the limits of the existing predictive models.",

      "abstract": "There is increasing concern within the scientific community about the underwater noise due to anthropogenic activity and its impact on marine life, with negative consequences on biodiversity and sea resources. In that context, the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive stated in 2008 that the anthropogenic noise due to shipping was to be mitigated. To address this issue, the European Union (EU) project \"Achieve QUieter Oceans by shipping noise footprint reduction\" (AQUO) (www.aquo.eu) started in October 2012 with a duration of four years. The project brought together experts from shipbuilding, underwater acoustics, and bioacoustics, with a multidisciplinary approach. In this paper, after giving a brief overview of the project structure, the methodology proposed by the AQUO project to set guidelines for controlling the underwater noise from commercial shipping is presented in more detail. Such a methodology is aimed at identifying the most promising strategies for the mitigation of the impact of shipping noise on marine fauna. Different technical as well as operational solutions are evaluated by taking into account the impact on marine life, the feasibility in terms of ship design, and the cost effectiveness, also considering fuel efficiency. While technical solutions are usually more effective at the design stage both in terms of costs and performance, operational solutions can potentially be adopted without any modification to the existing fleet. Furthermore, operational prescriptions can be set by national/local authorities who cannot directly intervene on ship configurations. The different solutions have been evaluated by means of numerical modeling carried out by using a Noise Footprint AssessmentModel derived from the Quonops tool.",

      "abstract": "The Lloyd's mirror effect is an acoustic effect taking place when a source of noise moves parallel to a reflecting surface. In the case of ships, the underwater sources of noise, mainly the propeller, are at constant depth, i.e. a constant distance, from the free surface that can be considered a perfectly reflecting surface. In such a configuration, a destructive-constructive interference pattern is generated in the time-frequency domain by the combination of the direct and surface-reflected sound waves. As the shape of the acoustic patterns depends on the speed of the ship, the relative distance between the ship and the hydrophones and the sound celerity, it is in principle possible (it has been successively done for aircrafts) to derive the above mentioned characteristics simply analysing the corresponding Lloyd's mirror effect. This is particularly interesting when monitoring shipping noise traffic when data regarding ships cannot directly derived by the Automatic Identification System (AIS). In the paper a set of measurements carried out in the framework of two EU FP7 European Projects are analysed to discuss about the possibility of estimating ship parameters using acoustical Lloyd's mirror effect. During the measurements the main ship parameters have been monitored by GPS therefore representing a good reference test.",

The available normative framework, albeit well established and developed in the form of Comfort Classes, is based on dB(A) limits for the different spaces on board and is main-ly applied on a voluntary basis. In the present study, an acoustical analysis of a typical passen-ger cabin in a Ro-Pax vessel has been carried out in order to provide an effective and compre-hensive picture of the sound distribution inside the cabin volume. A comparison between the measured noise levels and the proposed limits has been carried out, in order to identify the pres-ence of critical areas inside the cabin in respect to acoustic comfort. A finite element model of the cabin has been finally developed, aimed at obtaining the eigenmodes of the cabin, in order to analyse the sound intensity pattern for every associated eigenfrequency.",

      "abstract": "Achieving the right balance between fixed and operating costs is a key but non-trivial task for optimizing the characteristics of a fleet of ships for a new trade at a very early stage of the design. A wide range of design choices as well as a significant number of uncertainties related to the operation of the fleet affects those two expense items. In the proposed analysis, operative uncertainties rising from rough sea conditions are taken into account in a Simulation Based Design (SBD) framework for fleet generation and evaluation. The costs-benefits analysis is aimed at understanding the effects of variations in the installed power and in the ship capacity on the overall fleet performances. These two major characteristics of the ship design (and, accordingly, of the fleet of ships realizing the trade) are introduced in the numerical model considering the sea margin and the nominal capacity as free design parameters instead of fixing them as commonly done in practice. From a design point of view, this corresponds to the introduction of two new variables, enlarging the dimensions of the design space to be explored, better than relaxing the boundaries of a simpler design space. The validity of this approach is demonstrated by a practical application to the design of a fleet of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) carriers. In this context, the effects of variations in the fuel price and in the voyage length on the optimal fleet characteristics are analyzed and the results are discussed in comparison to those coming from the reference scenario.",

      "abstract": "In noise mapping of urban areas main sources for nuisance and sleep disturbance are roads, railways, airports and industrial plants. However, when a noise analysis of port cities is carried out, also harbor activities are to be considered as significant contributors to the 'soundscape'. Within the harbor, ships, when berthed at wharfs and possibly busy in loading or unloading operations, represent significant sources of noise. In these conditions, in fact, some of the ship's plants are running and high airborne noise levels may be radiated. Ships are not traditionally characterized as noise sources and their dimensions and complexity pose a challenge for the description of the acoustical field in urban areas around the port. The work presents a hybrid experimental-computational approach for the acoustical characterization of ships applied to a test case represented by a multipurpose ship. For the same ship, the propagation field is studied numerically to include an urban area around the port. The same experimental campaign is also used to introduce a new measurement procedure for an effective characterization of the ship source.",

The tool is based on combining the strip-theory programme PDSTRIP with the WavewatchIII operational model run at DICCA, University of Genoa, to assess safety, efficiency and comfort parameters of vessels and assist in route selection and optimisation. In this paper, the focus is on analysing the effect of parametric versus full wave spectra on the response of the vessel and the consequent route selection. The influence of the wave spectrum is demonstrated initially for an example sea-state localised in Eastern Liguria, and subsequently for a route from Genoa, Italy to Tangier, Morocco, with three predetermined route variations. A typical passenger ferry is considered with an operational ship speed of 15 kn, corresponding to a Froude number of 0.22. It is shown that using standard parametric formulations for the wave spectrum versus the full (numerically forecasted) directional spectrum can affect the route evaluation and potentially lead to a different optimum route choice.",

As regards shipping, emissions from ships into the environment of various nature (engine exhaust gases, anti-fouling paints leaching, ballast exchange, releases at sea of oil and other noxious liquid or solid cargoes, of sewage and of garbage) have been recognized as sources of pollution and therefore controlled and limited since a long time. The subject of noise emission has been identified only recently. To study the problem, the EU has funded, among others, the FP7 SILENV (Ship Innovative soLutions to rEduce Noise and Vibrations) project that run from 2010 to 2012. In the present work, the holistic approach followed within the project to characterize and control the ship as a source of noise is presented. Three types of noise emissions (in air, in water and inside the ship) are analyzed highlighting peculiarities and different strategies adopted to characterize the source, the impact on the receiver and the possible solutions to set limits to the ship emissions. The project outcome included a socalled \"Green Label\": a set of new prenormative requirements defined for the three main areas mentioned above.",

      "abstract": "The present paper deals with the side effects of propellers cavitation, i.e. pressure pulses and radiated noise. These effects are gaining more and more importance for commercial ships for different reasons. Pressure pulses significantly affect comfort onboard, thus their reduction is of utmost importance for all ships carrying passengers. As regards the underwater radiated noise, in the last decade interest has shifted from navy applications to commercial ships, due to the concern for the rising background noise in the oceans. The propellers, generating noise directly in water, represent one of the main contributions to the overall underwater noise emitted from ships. Due to the complexity of the mechanisms of propeller noise generation, different complementary strategies have to be followed to properly analyze the problem, ranging from induced pressure pulses to broadband noise and cavitation. In the present work, part of the activities carried out in the framework of the collaborative EU FP7 project AQUO (Achieve QUieter Oceans by shipping noise footprint reduction, www.aquo.eu) are reported. The paper presents the investigations carried out on a specific test case represented by a single screw research vessel, which is analyzed with three different strategies: numerical calculations, model scale investigations and full-scale measurements.",

      "abstract": "The requirement of better workers' psychophysical health and the wish to guarantee a correct comfort also during work activities, induce to consider the presence of significant pure tones also for the working spaces. However, the current European legislation regarding professional exposure to the noise of the workers, and namely the EU Directive 2003/10/CE, does not take into consideration the possible presence of pure tones in working noise. The same lack can be noticed in the standard ISO 1999:2013. As regards seafarers, the reference codes are the International Maritime Organization (IMO) Resolution A.468(XII) for ships built before 1 July 2014, and Resolution MSC.337(91) for newer ships. While tonal components are mentioned in the first one, stating that, if these are \"obvious\", the ISO noise rating (NR) number should be also determined, in the latter and most recent IMO Resolution no reference to tonal components is present. Tonal components cause annoyance and, at the same time, they induce hearing damage and can alter the behavior of workers, with a potential risk for the safety of ships. In this study, noise measurements taken onboard different ships are analyzed in order to determine seafarers' work exposure to tonal components. The survey includes different work spaces. To assess the presence of tonal components in crew's work environments the methodology of environmental noise analysis, defined in the Annex B of Italian Decree D.M. 16/3/98, has been used, making reference to ISO 226:2003 for determining normal equal-loudness level contours. The method used in order to evaluate tonal components is well established for the environmental noise annoyance and therefore it can be operatively extended to the workplace noise exposure. Results show that the presence of tonal disturbing components is not sporadic and therefore worthy of further analysis and regulation.",

      "abstract": "A statistical analysis of noise can play an important role in evaluating the performances of an acoustic system working underwater. If the system is either placed on board a vessel or operates nearby passing ships, the noise radiated by the vessel can considerably reduce the performances of the system if it has been not designed to have enough robustness. In the paper, a statistical analysis of ship noise records measured at sea is presented. Noise data were recorded in the framework of the EU FP7 European project AQUO (Achieve QUieter Oceans by shipping noise footprint reduction). Aim of the analysis is to characterize the ship noise in terms of probability distributions and their high-order moments. Since the overall ship noise is known to be generated by a number of sources with peculiar spectral energy distributions, the vessel spectrum can change considerably with a variation in the operating conditions. This approach allows determining the dependence of ship noise statistical properties on the actual navigation condition. In addition, since the ship noise records were simultaneously recorded by a vertical array of three hydrophones, a further analysis has been carried out to determine the effect of the receiver depth, and, accordingly, of the propagation path, in the recorded signal.",

Neglecting the low-frequency contributions, the focus is on the analysis of the broadband patterns in the range 100 Hz to 4 kHz A parameterization derived from a basic spectral pattern is adopted: the noise spectrum shape is approximated with a flat level magnitude up to a reasonable frequency followed by a logarithmic decay.

      "abstract": "There is a rising concern about the environmental status of the seas of our planet. Such concern regards several kinds of anthropogenic activities and their impact on the marine ecosystems. Part of the adverse effects are recognised to be due to various forms of acoustic emissions generated by human activities related to the exploitation of sea resources and to shipping. The main regulatory bodies at international level, in the last decade, have started to look into the problem with the aim of monitoring the environmental status of marine waters, in particular the acoustical aspects) identify the situations where the anthropogenic impact is most intrusive and study and promote future actions for its control and reduction. The present work reports about the development and validation of a simulation tool able to predict the noise field generated by a set of ships sailing in a specific area. The simulation is based on real traffic data derived from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) normally used to monitor shipping traffic and on specific data characterising the environment of the zone of interest. The tool is meant to provide the Regulator with a means to study the present situation (with on-line AIS data) and/or study the effectiveness of possible measures devoted to reduce the acoustical impact of shipping by design and/or operative requirements. Motivation, bases and characteristics of the developed procedure are described in the paper, where a first validation of the tool is presented on the basis of data regarding a sea area off Barcelona (Spain). Data include AIS records, environmental parameters and underwater sound levels surveyed by an hydrophone placed in the area. The work has been developed in the framework of the collaborative project AQUO (Achieve QUieter Oceans by shipping noise footprint reduction), funded by the European Commission within a call of the 7<sup>th</sup> Framework Programme dedicated to the assessment and mitigation of noise impacts of the maritime transport on the marine environment, coordinated topic 'The Ocean of Tomorrow'.",

      "abstract": "In the present study, full-scale noise levels measurements on board a Ro-Pax ferry have been carried out in various compartments of the ship, both in stationary conditions (navigation) and during manoeuvres. Noise levels have been surveyed in various categories of spaces located in all decks accessible to both passengers and crew, with the purpose of giving a complete and effective picture of the acoustic climate on board. The measured noise levels have been compared with current and proposed limits for working and living spaces, obtaining a clear identification of the most critical spaces on board the ship both in respect to acoustic comfort and noise exposure of crew during working hours. In cabins, different operating conditions for air conditioning have been tested, to analyse the specific contribution to annoyance of the ventilation noise, which turned out to be in many cases determinant. Transient conditions during manoeuvres entering and leaving harbours have been analysed by spectral time histories in cabins and public spaces close to the main propulsion plant and to bow thrusters. These situations correspond to considerably high levels, which may limit significantly operation during night time.",

      "abstract": "The sound propagation at sea is a key point in the study of the impact of underwater noise on the marine fauna. In the case of ship noise, the evaluation of the transmission losses is particularly important also for the acoustical characterization of the ship as a source of underwater noise. In fact, measurements of underwater noise emissions from commercial ships are carried out at sea typically during sea trials. This means that measurements can be carried out in a different environment, therefore with very different boundary conditions that, if not properly accounted for in the evaluation of the transmission can lead to different results in terms of ship source noise levels. Several parameters influence the sound transmission at sea: frequency, water depth, sound celerity profile in the water column, bottom composition. When carrying out measurements, such parameters should be in principle known to interpret correctly the data. The present work investigates the effects that uncertainties on the environmental parameters have on the transmission losses that occur between the source (the ship) and the receiver (the hydrophone). The numerical investigation of the transmission losses is carried out by means of a ray tracing and a wave number integration code systematically varying the input parameters.",

      "abstract": "The problem of the impact of airborne noise emitted by commercial ships moored at quay is gaining attention by Regulatory Bodies. The question is often raised by citizens sending complaints to the municipalities of port cities in which the harbour is located inside the town. The problem may be even more important in the case of pleasure crafts accessing protected areas and mooring there. Limit levels for airborne noise emissions started therefore to be fixed in normative as well as contract requirements. In the light of what above, an effective measurement procedure to characterise the noise emissions from ships and compare them to limits plays an important role. The procedure needs to take into account aspects linked to the ship source characteristics (dimensions, complexity, directivity) as well as related to the surrounding environment, which is often represented by the shipyard where the ship is built. The latter aspect includes the presence of obstacles and reflecting surfaces around the ship, as well as significant components of background noise. The paper recalls the background of a measurement procedure that was defined within the project SILENV of the 7<sup>th</sup> Framework Programme specifically for the purpose of the characterisation of ships as airborne noise sources and reports a trial application of this procedure to a ship moored at a yard quay. Instrumentation used and data post processing are discussed, together with practical problems encountered and solutions found in order to carry out measurements.",

      "abstract": "A major source of the underwater radiated noise from ships is represented by propulsion systems and by propellers in particular. The main noise-generating mechanism within ship propellers is cavitation, associated to the growing and collapse of vapour bubbles resulting from the unsteady hydrodynamic pressure field generated on the blades. The control of propeller underwater radiated noise is therefore strictly related to the control of cavitation phenomena, which are responsible for a larger part of the radiation.

      "abstract": "In the last decade of the 20th century the continuous increasing of human activities in the ocean has focused the attention of local and international institutions on the underwater noise pollution due to shipping traffic. While for military purposes the topic of ship noise generation gained a fundamental role since the WWII, in the civil field only recently standards for ship noise measurements have been addressed and limits to the radiated noise have been developed in order to reduce the shipping impact on the marine fauna. In view of the enforcement of compulsory limits in the next future, the possibility of evaluating the ship noise spectrum at a preliminary design stage represents a significant topic. In this paper, with the aim of verifying the reliability of a selection of available empirical models for the ship radiated noise, a comparison of predictions with measured noise spectra for a small set of ships is carried out.",

      "abstract": "The ship as whole represents quite a complex noise source. The generated noise affects definitely people on board the vessel (crew and passengers, directly exposed to sound pressure levels) but third parties as well, which may be reached by airborne or underwater noise transmission from the ship: inhabitants of areas near the coastline and near ports, the marine fauna living in zones with intense maritime traffic). The threefold aspect of the acoustical impact of ships (internal to the vessel, external in air and in water) is covered in the paper, which identifies in each context the main sources of noise, the potential receivers and the transmission paths linking sources and receivers. The state of the art and new trends in the characterization of the sources are evaluated, as well as the means available to model the transmission of acoustical power along the various effective paths. The available means for charactering the perception by the receivers in the various contexts are considered, in order to assess the impact of the noise radiation. The more or less recent introduction of norms and requirements in the different fields are discussed and analyzed, in order to highlight the evolution of the societal concern about the ship noise impact on second and third parties of the maritime transportation process. Such concern justifies the undergoing process of further implementations in the normative framework. The trends of this evolution are finally discussed, with description and motivation of pre-normative proposals covering the three aspects above mentioned.

      "abstract": "The problem of noise annoyance on board ships has been addressed since a long time. The first document setting limits on onboard noise was the \"Code on noise levels on board ships\", issued by the International Maritime Organisation in 1981. More recently all the major Classification Societies introduced in their requirements the so called \"Comfort Classes\". They generally provide different ratings of the acoustic comfort of ships. The growing needs of passengers and workers for acoustical comfort on board pushed both Classification Societies and IMO to consider an update of limits and criteria for noise annoyance assessment. The normative framework in the field is therefore presently in an evolution phase. In the present work, a series of existing measurements of noise carried out on a set of Ro-Pax vessels is analysed and compared with the existing requirements and with the new proposals of the SILENV collaborative project (Ships oriented Innovative soLutions to rEduce Noise & Vibrations), funded within the 7th Framework Programme of the E.U. and running in the period 2009-2012. The comparison provides an indication of the possibility for shipbuilding to cope with the new requests in terms of noise performances, provided that such requests are inserted in the design process. Further efforts are needed similar to those already implemented to fulfill the present formulations of compulsory requirements and reflected in the measured values. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group.",

This is due in part to the different point in time in which the different aspects were recognised to be relevant and therefore studied, assessed and regulated. The analysis of existing regulations is the basis for considering the present situation, on-going developments and possible future trends as regards the evaluation of ship noise impact on the various types of environment. The situation of the requirements developed for the maritime field appears to be in line with other fields of engineering as regards the definition of noise limits for the working environment, while the definition of comfort of living on board seems to be somehow lacking behind other fields, with possibility of taking advantage of their experience. Well established assessment procedures for external radiation in air appear to be not yet available and in this case a need for specific developments arises. Finally, for underwater noise emissions, there is availability of relatively well developed requirements, that however are not adequately correlated to the quantification of the effects of the noise emissions on the marine fauna. © 2012 Institute of Noise Control Engineering.",

      "abstract": "Airborne noise emissions from ships can be a significant source of annoyance. Therefore, it is important to accurately predict ship noise in order to get an effective environmental noise control in planning new ports, or in widening existing harbor, or in locating new mooring positions. To test the reliability of current commercial simulators in predicting the noise field from complex sources such as ships, in the present work the airborne noise propagation from two different vessels was modelled: a Multipurpose Ship and a Fishing Research Vessel. The development of the model for both ships was performed in five steps: acquisition of the input data; modelling of the ship in the sound propagation software; definition of the noise sources; model validation; output data generation. Simulated data were then compared with on field measurements. The obtained results rise some questions about the measurement techniques adopted to characterize the source levels and the validation data, the simplifications made on the ship surface and the typologies of sources utilized in the study. Future developments in numerical simulators are needed in order to better describe outdoor noise propagation from ships, taking into account the specific nature and complexity of such sources.",

      "abstract": "The rising concern about the environmental impact of ship noise on the marine fauna recently pushed national and international bodies to face the problem. In the last decade a few mass strandings of cetaceans due to sea trials of navy sonars (Frantzis (1998)), enforced the interest on noise pollution effects on marine mammals. The problem of evaluating the impact of underwater noise from ships is very complex due to the difficulties in characterising the whole noise chain (source, transmission path, receiver). Standards have been recently issued aimed at the measurement of underwater noise emitted from commercial ships. As regards the transmission path, problems are linked to the correct evaluation of the transmission loss which is influenced by many environmental parameters (water temperature, salinity, pressure, bottom composition etc.) which cannot be easily monitored during measurements. Finally the actual sensibility to noise of the marine mammals it is not completely known, especially for species belonging to the Mysticetes (Baleen Whales). These problems have been analysed in the SILENV collaborative project (Ships oriented Innovative soLutions to rEduce Noise & Vibrations), devoted to the holistic analysis of noise emissions from the ship [radiation inside the ship and outside (in air and in water)].",

At the same time, many of the requirements are actually expressed in non quantitative terms and neglect parameters like noise spectra, low frequency pulsations or sound reverberation, which deeply influence the \"sound wellness\". Aim of this paper is therefore to improve present requirements by introducing more meaningful noise annoyance criteria. These new criteria should be at the same time able to better express the actual reactions to noise from crew and passengers and simple enough to be widely applied on board ships. Such enhanced criteria are derived from the noise rating methods provided to rate indoor background sound in the civil engineering context. The possibility to make use of these indicators in the naval field is analyzed and some recommendations for a proper application on ships are given.",

In any harbor, NSM can be obtained by evaluating the sound field for each type of sound sources standing in the port area and by superimposing all noise contributions. The present paper suggests a method to achieve such acoustical analysis of port noise. The method has a general purpose and is implemented in four steps: definition of the vessels category; measurements to characterize ship as a noise source; modeling of outdoor noise propagation; map drawing. All these subjects are discussed in the paper and some specific recommendations to get at a successful noise mapping of ports are reported, too. In the end, limit values to keep under control the problem of noise pollution due to ships are proposed.",

The problem of health and comfort for crew and passengers on board has been considered since a few decades, leading to quite a structured and detailed framework of Norms and Requirements. On the other hand, only in recent years a growing attention has been devoted to air-borne noise emissions outside the ship, for which requirements are not present. Underwater noise emissions have, even more recently, gained attention for their potential interference with mammals' communications and with the sophisticated use such animals make of acoustic signals for interacting with their living environment. An aim of the present work is to review the state of the art in the three areas above identified outlining the differences in the specific fields as regards: the present knowledge of the phenomena involved; the accuracy of the models available for the description of noise propagation; the accuracy of the models available for the quantification of noise effects.",
