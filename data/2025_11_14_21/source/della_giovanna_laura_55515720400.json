      "abstract": "Electrical insulation is a critical component in electrical machines. The performance of the insulation system can be adversely affected by operating conditions that induce aging. Assessing the impact of environmental stresses is essential for predicting the failure of electrical insulation. Predicting maintenance to prevent service interruptions caused by insulation breakdown is a key objective. For type I insulating systems used in low-voltage and low-power rotating electrical machines, it has been demonstrated that partial discharges (PDs) are a contributing factor to electrical insulation breakdown. In fact, these insulating systems are not able to withstand the action of PD activity. The inception and evolution of PD activity is an indication of the poor conditions of the electrical insulating system, and this activity can be produced by the electronic power supply. The progressive reduction in partial discharge inception voltage (PDIV) is attributed to the deterioration of insulation properties induced by operational stresses. This study aims to evaluate and compare the effects of thermal stress on various types of enameled wires by collecting the PDIV values over time. In this paper, the authors analyze some particular effects of thermal stress as an aging factor. During the tests, an electrical stress was applied, which acted as a conditioning stress rather than one capable of producing degradation phenomena, as it was not high enough to initiate PD activity. In this research study, twisted pairs prepared from copper wires were evaluated. These wires were coated with various types of enamel and belonged to the thermal class of 200 °C. The samples were subjected to thermal aging tests at different temperatures. An electrical conditioning stress was also applied during all the tests and pertained to the same voltage, amplitude and frequency. The PDIV value pertaining to each sample was regularly measured to monitor its evolution over time.",

      "abstract": "The insulating systems are one of the most important parts for the proper operation of the electrical devices and can be subject to deterioration due to several phenomena like partial discharges (PDs). Nowadays, due to the increasing presence of the power electronic devices, there is an interest in studies relevant to the PD activity not only in the presence of pure sinusoidal voltage waveforms but also when a dc component is added as a result of electronic ac/dc conversions or floating potential operations. This work is focused on aging tests on twisted pairs specimens applying pure ac or ac + dc waveforms. The test voltage waveforms are applied to twisted pairs specimens until the total breakdown, assumed as end life criterion, is reached defining the life curves both in ac and ac + dc cases. During the aging, PDs are acquired, and it is possible to compute derived quantities useful to define a predictive model of the residual specimen lifetime. For what it concerns the presence of an overlapped dc component, the obtained results suggest that, considering the conditions imposed in this study, no remarkable changes in the aging phenomena and in the measured PD activity are identified.",

Online PDs measurement allows for continuous monitoring of the insulation system. An online PDs measurement system for air-insulated switchgear (AIS) is developed, based on transient earth voltage (TEV) sensors, and evaluated for morphological analysis of insulation defects. The evaluation is conducted comparing the developed system with a conventional PD measurement system based on the IEC 60270 standard. The aim of the proposed system is to facilitate its integration with minimal retrofitting and operational disruption assuring the possibility to identify and analyze the defects. A pilot system, employing an AIS, is designed and tested. The results from both the PDs measurement systems are presented and discussed. Furthermore, the impact of a high capacitive load connected to the switchgear is investigated, and the possible effects of a capacitive load due to an MV cable is considered by simulating the realistic cable geometry.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this work is to achieve effective features to enable machine learning algorithms to identify defects and incipient faults in the case of insulating systems used for high-voltage direct current (HVDC) applications. Partial discharge (PD) testing and analysis has become a key tool in all aspects of the design, commissioning, maintenance and monitoring of AC and DC insulating systems. In this study, PD measurements were conducted on a medium voltage (MV) cable segment with artificial defects. These measurements were performed under a negative HVDC power supply using various sensors, including a High Frequency Current Transformer (HFCT), a Rogowski Coil, and a VHF Antenna. The acquired signals were post-processed using the Normalized Auto-correlation Function (NACF). The 3D NACF space plots have been obtained by selecting the three larger dispersion components obtained by the comparison of the NACF of the acquired signals. The objective was to analyze the differences in the measured PD signal data obtained with the three different sensors using machine learning algorithms. This analysis provides insights into the effectiveness of the developed features and their potential when different kind of sensors are used for the detection of faults in case of HVDC applications.",

      "abstract": "This research study aims to investigate the influence of various partial discharge (PD) sensors in handling PD signals separations. Two PD sources have been used to generate surface partial discharges. Surface partial discharges were generated using two PD sources, and the signals were detected using three different sensors: a High-Frequency Current Transformer (HFCT), a resistor (R<inf>M</inf>), and a VHF antenna. The primary objective is to highlight the strengths and challenges associated with each PD sensor, particularly in the context of signal separation and clustering. The impact of the characteristics of the selected sensors is examined. The study evaluates the efficiency, potential, and limitations of the sensor-clustering algorithm sets to evaluate the possibilities in employing them for fault detection and maintenance planning.",

      "abstract": "High Frequency/High Voltage Pulsed (HF/HVP) transformers are often used in low power applications. The insulation system is the most critical part of the design because the limited dimensions lead to the presence of high electrical stresses, furthermore the characteristics of the high voltage winding and of the high voltage pulses, result in a not uniform voltage distribution along the winding itself. The high electrical field concentrations require high performance insulating systems including enamels, filled polymers, loaded cast resins. The aim of this work is to implement a tool to be used during the manufacturing process to evaluate the quality of the insulating system as regards the expected lifetime. This tool, based on the partial discharge measurements, should be able to discriminate among HF/HVP transformers having expected lifetimes longer or shorter than a predefined value.",

      "abstract": "The electrical insulation is a crucial element in electrical machines. The performance of the insulation system can be affected by the operating conditions that cause ageing of the insulation. The evaluation of the effects of the environment stresses is a key in the prediction of the electrical insulation breakdown. Being capable of forecasting the maintenance avoiding the out of service due to insulation breakdown is certainly an objective. It is proven that partial discharges (PD) are one of the causes of electrical insulation breakdown. The evolution of PD is an indication of the condition of the electrical insulating system. The severe lowering of the Partial Discharge Inception Voltage (PDIV) value can be a signal of the approaching to the insulation total breakdown. The continuous lowering of the PDIV is due to the degradation of the insulation properties caused by the stresses applied during the operation time. The aim of this study is to evidence and compare the effects of thermal stress on different kind of enamelled wires analysing the PDIV because is one of the accelerating factors together with relative humidity and frequency of the applied voltage [1]-[7]. In this study, twisted pairs made with copper wires covered with different enamels and having thermal class 200°C were assessed. The samples were subjected to thermo-electrical aging tests at the same voltage amplitude and frequency while different temperatures have been applied. The PDIV relevant to the samples was measured regularly to monitor its evolution over time.",

The behavior of the different materials were compared and correlated with the material properties and structure. The treeing inception voltage (TIV) and the time to breakdown (TBD) as the final event of the electrical tree growth were considered. Furthermore, in order to identify the presence of defects inside the specimens due to the preparation process the partial discharge (PD) activity was monitored.

In this work the PD evolution is monitored both for conventional and corona resistant enamels subjected to different voltage waveforms at different amplitudes. Suitable twisted pair specimens insulated by the considered enamels have been prepared and tested. Aging tests have been performed, monitoring the PD activity until the enamel breakdown, which is assumed as the end-point criterion. Pulsed and sinusoidal voltage waveforms have been applied having different amplitudes. In order to monitor the degradation phenomena, the partial discharge activity has been observed by means of a phase resolved partial discharge analyzer.

The aim of this work is to investigate the possibility to find out a new materials for electrical insulations that could be a valid substitute of XLPE. The dispersion of polar polymers, such as EVA, in non-polar polymers could be a strategy to better disperse polar nanofillers in the polymer matrices, leading to better performances. In this work the electrical behaviour of the LDPE and EVA composites, in the short and medium term, has been investigated after an assessment of the dispersion quality, of the morphology and of the thermal properties of the prepared samples.",

      "abstract": "The adoption of switching electronic converters for squirrel cage motor drives can lead to some critical issues during the normal operation. The early failure of the stator winding insulation is one of the most investigated problems. The cost of motor failure is measured by interruption of plant output as well as extent of repair or replacement. The Surge Test is one of the most important tests for industrial electric motors, insofar as it allows the accurate checking of the machine functionality in order to identify any possible fault in the windings. Surge test is non-destructive and it has to be conducted at test voltage amplitudes so that they do not produce any winding damage and any significant insulation system degradation. This research presents the outcome of an experimental campaign in order to investigate the role of the voltage pulses on the degradation of the stator winding insulation of Type I electric motors: during the study the inter-turn, the groundwall and the phase-phase insulation systems have been taken into account. Electrical aging test have been performed using a surge test waveform at the terminals of the windings. Suitable electrical parameters have been monitored in order to identify the life end conditions. The amplitude of the applied voltage have been varied and the life time values have been collected and analysed. Furthermore the correlation between the repetitive partial discharge inception voltage and the life time has been investigated. © 2013 IEEE.",

Due to the presence of these inverter drives, the stator motor windings are subjected to severe voltage waveforms. When the electrical motors having stator windings insulated by means of type I random wire wound are subjected to this kind of severe voltage waveforms, reliability problems, due to the insulating system degradation, increase. In this research work, conventional and nanocomposite enamels have been analyzed: suitable twisted pair specimens insulated by the studied enamels have been prepared and tested. The tests were performed applying sinusoidal voltages having different amplitudes and varying the relative humidity. During the aging tests campaign the amplitude voltage waveform have been always set higher than the partial discharges inception voltage in order to operate in presence of surface partial discharges. The enamel breakdown conditions have been chosen as end-point criterion and the lifetime values have been collected and compared. In order to evidence the behavior of the considered conventional and nanocomposite enamels, the material life curves have been computed.

      "abstract": "In these last years, different research studies constantly investigated the possibility to find a new class of materials in the field of medium/high voltage insulation. Nowadays, the conventional materials that are commonly used in this field of interest are non-recyclable. In this research activity, the electrical behavior of new recyclable nanostructured materials is investigated in order to study the feasibility of their future employment as substitutes for the currently employed materials. The materials have been prepared by adding different kinds of nanofiller to the syndiotactic polypropylene matrix; in order to obtain a good dispersion of the considered nanofillers, the materials have been processed by extrusion and their final homogeneity have been investigated by means of a scanning electron microscope. In order to investigate the electrical performances of these materials, suitable film specimens have been prepared by hot compression molding technique and subsequently electrical aging tests have been performed to evidence the short and the medium term behavior of the tested materials. The short term behavior has been investigated by dielectric strength measurements, while the medium term behavior has been evaluated by electrical aging tests. During the aging tests, the specimens have been subjected to 50 Hz frequency sinusoidal voltage waveform: different voltage amplitudes have been considered and the breakdown condition has been chosen as end-point criterion. The relevant times to breakdown have been collected and used to plot the life curves. Analyzing and comparing the obtained results it has been possible to highlight a different behaviour among the nanocomposites and the pure polymer. © 2012 IEEE.",
