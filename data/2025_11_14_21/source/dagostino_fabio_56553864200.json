      "abstract": "The operation of inverter-based resources connected to weak grids poses stability challenges. For megawatt-sized converters, the limitations imposed in terms of switching frequency result in non-negligible delays introduced by the digital implementation of the control system. These delays impact both system design and small-signal stability limits. To allow the proper characterization of the study, an investigation of bottom-up design approaches and best practices is conducted for selecting per-unit parameters. An in-depth analytical impedance-based modeling of the resource is performed to account for the proper representation of components and control system in the synchronous-reference frame, including control and modulation delays that result in axis coupling. A phase delay compensation technique is proposed and implemented within a modified current controller. The impedance-based stability analysis is performed through the application of the generalized Nyquist criterion to assess the maximum power that the resource can deliver during weak grid operations. The analysis shows that the proposed phase delay compensation technique effectively extends the small-signal stability limit of the inverter-based resource. The methodology is validated through the state-space eigenvalue analysis, and a set of EMT simulations. Finally, results are validated using a control hardware-in-the-loop experimental setup, which employs a real-time FPGA-based simulation platform and an actual converter controller.",

      "abstract": "This work proposes a model predictive control (MPC) approach aimed at optimizing the efficiency of a hybrid shipboard power system (SPS) while ensuring secure operations. A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation is exploited, considering both process constraints and N-1 security requirements. In addition, constraints are implemented to optimize the ship's speed, while ensuring the target distance, and compliance with carbon intensity indicator (CII) limits. Electric load data are based on real measurements. The prediction of the load and the speed of the ship is obtained through a recurrent neural network (RNN). The optimization provides the unit commitment and the active power set-points for all resources. The algorithm is tested in a simulation environment where the model of a notional all-electric ship is developed in MATLAB/Simulink. The results demonstrate that the MPC approach can continuously and rapidly optimize the management of the ship's resources, making it suitable for seagoing applications. Additionally, the proposed simulation platform allows testing the performance over large time horizons, in a short period of time.",

      "abstract": "Deep learning models have shown great potential for fault location and classification tasks in distribution systems. Emerging multi-scale data sources such as waveform measurement units, synchro-phasors, smart meters, weather data, and other information from electricity markets provide a rich source of information that can be leveraged for various applications in power system operations. However, the lack of sufficient training datasets poses a significant challenge in effectively training these models to achieve high accuracy and generalization. This paper proposes a novel architecture for the generation of fault datasets from the distribution system and the fault location tasks. It then develops a fault classification solution using graph convolutional neural network that can capture topology information, combined with discrete orthogonal Stockwell's transform for extracting frequency-domain features from time-series data. Pre-processing of the bus voltage angle and magnitude from strategic locations was used. The method was tested to predict faulted buses in the Cigre distribution test system. Comparisons were made with various standard classifiers. The results show the usefulness of the data generation solution for developing fault location models and the benefit of integrating topology data into the classifier with a graph convolutional neural network technique, as it outperforms other techniques in most scenarios.",

In this context, Grid-Forming (GFM) control using Virtual Synchronous Generator (VSG) strategies offers grid support capabilities. This study investigates the GFM control of a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) Wind Turbine (WT). A set of study cases is simulated to assess the impact of virtual inertia under varying wind speeds and different levels of inertia. The analysis considers two operational modes: Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) and deloaded mode. System performance is evaluated on the basis of the Rate of Change of Frequency (RoCoF) and the frequency nadir. Additionally, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the effect of frequency droop in GFM-VSG control has not been previously examined in the context of virtual inertia provision. Therefore, a comparative analysis is presented in the two operating modes.",

      "abstract": "This work addresses the optimal sizing and operations of a hydrogen-based multi-energy system in the Port of Livorno, Italy, aimed at decarbonizing maritime activities. The system includes renewable generation, batteries, electrolyzers, and hydrogen storage. Hydrogen is used both for fueling ships and for injection into the nearby gas grid, complying with hydrogen blending limits. A simulation-based optimization framework is developed to solve the plant sizing problem: the outer level recursively minimizes the Net Present Cost via surrogate optimization, while the inner level optimally schedules daily operations by solving a mixed-integer linear programming problem. The framework accounts for markets participation (electricity, gas, environmental) and technical constraints. The feasibility of the optimized hydrogen injection strategy is assessed through a steady-state isothermal fluid-dynamic model. The system is sized based on the Italian regulation assuming a 2% vol hydrogen injection limit, while operational scenarios with injection limits ranging from 2% to 20% vol are analyzed. Results show that increasing the blending limit from 2% to 20% enables a 9% rise in renewable hydrogen utilization and reduces the Levelized Cost of Hydrogen from 3.82 €/kg to 3.49 €/kg.",

      "abstract": "Solid-state circuit breakers offer an effective solution for protecting DC systems, thanks to their fast operation and arcfree interruption. However, their novel architecture, functionalities, and behavior necessitate a deeper system-level understanding to support proper integration and fault management. This work presents the development of a digital twin of a previously designed and experimentally validated solid-state circuit breaker, implemented as a Functional Mock-up Unit in compliance with the Functional Mock-up Interface standard. The digital twin is calibrated using a parameter estimation algorithm based on experimental data, ensuring accurate replication of the physical device dynamic behavior. The aim is to provide a versatile tool that can facilitate short-circuit analysis studies and support the development of novel protection strategies for DC power system.",

      "abstract": "This work presents a set of linearization techniques to address non-linearities, enabling the use of Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP). By using the optimization of a Power Electronic Building Block (PEBB)-based power corridor in shipboard power distribution systems as a case study, the methodology illustrates how transforming key non-linear relationships into linear constraints takes advantage of the benefits of linear programming. This approach is generally faster and easier to solve, providing either an optimal solution or a proof of infeasibility. In contrast, non-linear programming, while more flexible, often requires additional iterations and assumptions. The MILP formulation incorporates strategies to model design trade-offs and discrete decision variables, such as the grouping of PEBBs in series or parallel, to meet specified performance criteria. The proposed methodologies are implemented using Matlab and the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) with CPLEX as the solver. An analysis of the influence of linearization techniques on the results is conducted, revealing that different approaches affect the solution's accuracy.",

      "abstract": "The decarbonization of the energy sector represents a challenge that requires new tools and approaches of analysis. This paper aims to demonstrate the fundamental role that geographical distributed real-time co-simulations (GD-RTDS) can play in this regard. To this end, three different case studies have been analyzed with GD-RTDS, covering a wide range of applications for the energy sector decarbonization: (a) implementation of Renewable Energy Communities for supporting the share increase of Renewable Energy Sources, (b) the integration and management of Onshore Power Supply, and (c) the integration of a forecasting tool for the management of the Electric Vehicle charging. The performed experiments included fully simulated components, together with (power) hardware-in-the-loop and software-in-the-loop elements. These components have been simulated in different laboratory facilities in Italy and Germany, all operating in a synchronized manner under the presented geographically-distributed setup. The results show that the proposed architecture is flexible enough to be used for modeling all the different case studies; moreover, they highlight the significant contribution that the GD-RTDS methodology can give in informing and driving energy transition policies and the fundamental role of power systems to spearhead the complete decarbonization of the energy sector.",

The simulation platform integrates the model of the shipboard power plant, the hydrodynamic and environmental forces and the dynamic positioning controller. The shipboard power system has been modelled considering the electro-mechanical behaviour, i.e. the power-frequency dynamic, so that the platform can run in real time and be linked with the control hardware. The simulation platform has been tested through a detailed simulation campaign by using as a study case a Platform Supply Vessel where its behaviour in harsh conditions has been validated. Moreover, a control hardware-in-the-loop configuration has been realized, where the controller logic has been implemented in a real PCL. Finally, a comparison between the two simulation approaches is shown and the results are discussed.",

Modern shipboard power system configurations are incorporating energy storage systems to enhance efficiency, creating challenges in sizing the generation stations due to their time-dependent nature. Accurate power profiles are essential for sizing, management strategies, and estimating ship operations. In particular, the necessity to have a more accurate load profile is more and more essential for vessel with storage systems. To address the need for electric power profile estimation for ships, in this paper, we present a method to estimate the power profile of ship loads based on deterministic Electric Power Load Analysis (EPLA) integrated with a Markov chain model.

Electric vehicles can operate in vehicle-to-grid mode, performing energy regulation in order to maximize the port earnings.

      "abstract": "This paper introduces a Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based strategy to optimally control the active power exchange of a unit composed by a Wind Farm (WF) and a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS). In particular, the aim of the controller is to combine a Synthetic Inertia Service (SIS) with the Fast Reserve Service (FRS) as defined by the Italian Transmission System Operator (TSO). Specific versions of the MPC controller are then defined in order to realize one of the two services or to provide both simultaneously. Proper rules are established to switch among the different control algorithms and obtain an effective combination of FRS and SIS. Simulation results show the potentiality of the proposed approach.",

Moreover, with the increasing electrification of ships driven by stringent emission regulations, the installation of batteries onboard ships is a major trend. While batteries traditionally serve as an energy resource to enhance efficiency, they also possess the potential to improve the performance in terms of voltage and frequency regulation. Therefore, this paper presents an optimal sizing methodology for Battery Energy Storage Systems considering their exploitation for Primary Frequency Regulation. The objective is to determine the optimal size of the BESS to ensure fast recovery time and contain frequency deviations after a perturbation.",

      "abstract": "The maritime industry is undergoing a significant transformation with the integration of advanced power electronics and converter technologies onboard cruise ships. This work explores the effects of power converter integration on shipboard power quality, particularly in cruise vessels that depend heavily on these converters for efficient power conversion. The study proposes a preliminary investigation of the potential challenges arising from the complex interplay of power electronic devices, including variable frequency drives, rectifiers, and in- verters, with the ship’s power distribution grid. A comprehensive measurement campaign is conducted onboard representative cruise ships, utilizing advanced monitoring equipment to capture power quality indexes related to different power systems and conversion architecture. The primary objectives of this investigation are to assess power quality indexes and to develop models for analyzing and validating real measurement data. Two similar cruise ships, each equipped with different technologies for driving synchronous propulsion motors, were used as case studies. Through data analysis and ETAP modeling, the research compares the performance and power quality impacts of these technologies under various operational conditions. The findings reveal distinct total har- monic distortion of voltage behaviours for the two ships, highlighting the varying effects of synchro-converters and cyclo-converters on power quality during port and navigation conditions. The study emphasizes the impor- tance of maintaining a stable and high-quality power supply in the maritime environment, and provides insights into the implications of power quality issues on the performance of onboard equipment.",

The optimization is based on a two-stage algorithm in which the optimal energy management is exploited at each step of the sizing process. The research extends previous works by introducing fuel cell and electrolyzer through the inclusion of their efficiency model in the energy management algorithm. Simulations with a time horizon of one year are conducted, considering two case studies with different goals: minimizing CO<inf>2</inf> emissions and minimizing operational costs. The algorithm is tested on a notional smart port and the two case studies are compared. Results show that reducing the environmental impact increases the usage of the hydrogen based resources. On the other hand, both the capital and operational costs increase.",

Recently, the International Maritime Organization has introduced the Carbon Intensity Indicator to limit the environmental impact of ships, pushing designers to define new solutions to reduce polluting emissions. The proposed methodology allows to estimate the environmental performances of a ship during the preliminary design phase, starting from the mission analysis. The tool simulates different power plant configurations, including diesel generators with different type of fuels, battery energy storage systems, fuel cells and hydrogen storage systems. Each source is modelled in the quasi-dynamic domain, where a set of selected state variables is taken into account. The load is derived from the ship mission profile through a stochastic process that considers the ship speed. Different power management strategies are tested to exploit the various resources while maximizing the operating condition requirements. A set of key performance indicators, such as the CO<inf>2</inf> emissions, the weight, and volume of the equipment, allows to compare the various power plant configurations so that the preliminary design solution can be identified.",

      "abstract": "DC microgrids represent a valuable solution for the realization of shipboard power systems. However, protection of dc microgrid is challenging: the absence of zero crossing of dc currents and the fast response of new technologies of energy storage system such as supercapacitor and batteries introduce strict requirements on the circuit breaker performances, making the conventional electro-mechanical circuit breaker not suitable for these applications. For these reasons, the solid-state circuit breaker is one of the most promising solutions. However, this component requires the presence of a current-limiting inductor, for limitation of the maximum value of fault current, whose effect in the normal operation of the system has not been addressed in literature. This work aims to identify, through an analysis of the impedance ratio in the point of coupling and real-time simulations, the presence of a potential resonance in the dc-bus of a notional dc microgrid. Different study cases have been considered, varying the value of the inductive fault current limiter, demonstrating the need to further investigating this phenomenon.",

The problem solution provides the optimal size of all the resources, taking into account a defined optimal energy management strategy. A notional smart port equipped with renewable resources has been used as study case, with the inclusion of data obtained from a real port to emulate the shore to ship power demand.

      "abstract": "This paper introduces an extension of an algorithm for fault detection and localization in active radial distribution networks based on state estimation and phasor measurement devices. This work takes into account the possibility of changing the network topology through switching devices, usually as a consequence of the protection system triggering after a fault occurrence. Therefore, an automatic topology estimation method is developed to be run together with the fault detection and localization algorithm. Hence, this work calls back the same assumptions in terms of optimal measurement device placement and observability to have the algorithm work properly with a reduced number of metering devices respect to the number of nodes of the network. The approach is validated through simulations carried out on a benchmark radial distribution network.",

      "abstract": "The ability to maintain the power balance, and effectively share the demand power among the available generating units is one of the essential requirements of a dc shipboard microgrid. When multiple power sources participate in the voltage regulation of a common dc-bus, droop control is typically used and a steady-state error in the voltage cannot be avoided. This work investigates a distributed control strategy inspired by the cross-current compensation technique, originally developed for ac power plants, that allows to eliminate the steady-state voltage error while enforcing the current sharing. The sources participating in the voltage regulation are equipped with a cascading controller where the outer voltage control loop, fed with the compensated voltage measurement, generates the reference signal for the inner current control loop. Control equations are developed, and a set of real-time simulations is performed. Results show that the proposed control strategy is effective in eliminating the steady-state voltage error and ensuring current sharing. Moreover, the control strategy exhibits a fail-safe behavior that allows the system to remain stable even in the event of compensation failure.",

Installation of energy storage systems is a key intervention for managing the new security and environmental needs brought by the RESs volatility. This is especially important for transmission networks prone to congestion issues, with critical links between portions of the grid and with a very high capacity of renewable generation, such as the transmission network of Sicily (Italy). This work uses a probabilistic planning methodology for the optimal allocation and sizing of storage systems, previously developed and applied to a real distribution network, also accounting for reactive regulation of voltage by distributed energy resources. The application is implemented in MATLAB/GAMS environment assuming a new wind offshore farm connected to the reinforced grid according to intervention foreseen by the Italian transmission system operator. The result shows the feasibility of application of the methodology to a transmission network, and can be a robust tool for the allocation and sizing of energy storage systems in the considered scenario.",

The state space averaging technique has been employed to develop an unified continuous model of the system under study.

The high voltage shore connection (HVSC) system is the key enabling facility that allows providing power from the shore-side electrical system to the ship. The design of the shore connection needs a comprehensive assessment of the fault currents in different operating scenarios. International standards require the neutral point of the shore connection transformer to be equipped with a neutral grounding resistor. Its value has to be defined to guarantee the safety and protection of equipment and personnel in the case of single phase-to-ground faults. Moreover, three-phase short circuits need to be considered to size equipment and protection devices. A crucial role is played by the frequency converter control system, required to adapt the mains frequency to the frequency of the ship. In this work, a complete electromagnetic dynamic model of the HVSC has been developed, including a frequency converter, a shore-side transformer, connection medium voltage (MV) cables, and a power system of the ship, to analyze in detail the behavior of the system in the case of single phase-to-ground fault and three-phase short circuit, taking into account relevant standards and best practices.",

      "abstract": "This paper summarizes the results of a power system stability analysis realized for the EU project OSMOSE. The case study is the electrical network of Sicily, one of the two main islands of Italy, in a scenario forecasted for 2050, with a large penetration of renewable generation. The objective is to establish if angle and voltage stabilities can be guaranteed despite the loss of the inertia and the regulation services provided today by traditional thermal power plants. To replace these resources, new flexibility services, potentially provided by renewable energy power plants, battery energy storage systems, and flexible loads, are taken into account. A highly detailed dynamical model of the electrical grid, provided by the same transmission system operator who manages the system, is modified to fit with the 2050 scenario and integrated with the models of the mentioned flexibility services. Thanks to this dynamic model, an extensive simulation analysis on large and small perturbation angle stability and voltage stability is carried out. Results show that stability can be guaranteed, but the use of a suitable combination of the new flexibility services is mandatory.",

      "abstract": "The microgrids design for remote locations represents one of the most important and critical applications of the microgrid concept. It requires the correct sizing and the proper utilization of the different sources to guarantee the economical feasibility and the reliability of the supply. This study illustrates an efficiency-based power management strategy, designed for an undergoing microgrid project, where the sizing process of the resources (diesel generators, battery energy storage system, and PV plant) is obtained using a mixed-integer optimization algorithm. The proposed power management strategy guarantees the efficient exploitation of the power sources, which is one of the key elements of the optimal sizing process, being naturally included in the definition of the energy cost functions. The effectiveness of the power control strategy is validated by means of quasi-dynamic simulations on the complete microgrid model, where sources are defined by the optimal problem solution, while the cabling (size and length) and the main switchboards location reflect the expected system layout. Results obtained from the simulation of the microgrid electrical system include losses, and allow to verify and to highlight the desired quantities, such as the quality of supply at each busbar (voltage magnitude), and the state of charge of the energy storage system.",

One of the most promising solutions to model the response of ADNs is the development of equivalent dynamic models, which are capable of dynamically representing ADNs by reducing system complexity. Gray-box modeling allows to select a physically parameterized model, based on the available physical knowledge. In this way, all model parameters maintain a physical meaning, which makes possible to simulate generation and load variations including control and automation actions. This chapter starts from a gray-box linear modeling method. Subsequently, a gray-box nonlinear modeling method is introduced, including system operating constraints and avoiding any linearization of the model. The result is a model that can be effectively adapted to different configurations and operating conditions. Simulations and experimental results are detailed and discussed.",

      "abstract": "The necessity to meet strict constraints on vessels emissions leads to a progressive adoption of innovative dc native energy sources. These sources are converter interfaced, and need to be integrated with the traditional power station. Two main converter control families are proposed in the literature: the grid-following and the grid-forming. This paper investigates the condition in which a converter interfaced unit, equipped alternatively with these type of control schemes, and a traditional diesel generator of comparable size, simultaneously contribute to the shipboard frequency and voltage regulation. A laboratory test bench has been developed to reproduce the shipboard power system, and to evaluate its regulating performances using either the grid-following or grid-forming strategy. The results are compared with a base case in which only the traditional diesel generator sustains the microgrid. The conclusions on the assessments of the different strategies are presented, considering the practical feasibility of such systems for actual seagoing shipboard microgrid.",

      "abstract": "To guarantee the small-signal stability in power systems with lower rotational inertia due to high renewable energy sources penetration, a coordinated controller exploiting the inertia of variable speed wind turbines is here proposed and assessed. In particular, wind turbines based on permanent magnet synchronous generators are considered for this scope; the rotor kinetic energy reserve and the electrostatic energy stored in the supercapacitor units interfaced to the DC-link are employed to provide the inertial response. The controllers of the individual schemes are first presented alone; then, the coordinated control scheme is derived. The impact on power system small-signal stability of these schemes is studied first on the well-known Two-Area Network, and then on a portion of the Italian transmission grid employed in the framework of the European project OSMOSE. For the considered networks, both modal analysis and dynamic simulation results, evaluated in the DIgSILENT PowerFactory environment, indicate that the coordinated synthetic inertia control scheme enhances the small-signal stability with the correct gain selection.",

The main objective of the equivalent modeling is to represent the dynamic response of a microgrid with a simplified model. The main contribution of this work is the experimental validation of a two-step process, composed by the definition of a nonlinear equivalent model with operational constraints, adapted to the microgrid environment, and the identification procedure used to define the model parameters. Once the parameters are identified, the simplified model is ready to reproduce the microgrid behavior to voltage and frequency variations, in terms of active and reactive power exchanges at the point of common coupling. To validate the proposed approach, a set of experimental tests have been carried out on a real low voltage (LV) microgrid considering different configurations, including both grid-connected and islanded operating conditions. Results show the effectiveness of the proposed technique and the applicability of the model to perform dynamic simulations.",

      "abstract": "Recent and strict regulations in the maritime sector regarding exhaust gas emissions has led to an evolution of shipboard systems with a progressive increase of complexity, from the early utilization of electric propulsion to the realization of an integrated shipboard power system organized as a microgrid. Therefore, novel approaches, such as the model-based design, start to be experimented by industries to obtain multiphysics models able to study the impact of different designing solutions. In this context, this paper illustrates in detail the development of a multiphysics simulation framework, able to mimic the behaviour of a DC electric ship equipped with electric propulsion, rotating generators and battery energy storage systems. The simulation platform has been realized within the retrofitting project of a Ro-Ro Pax vessel, to size components and to validate control strategies before the system commissioning. It has been implemented on the Opal-RT simulator, as the core component of the future research infrastructure of the University of Genoa, which will include power converters, storage systems, and a ship bridge simulator. The proposed model includes the propulsion plant, characterized by propellers and ship dynamics, and the entire shipboard power system. Each component has been detailed together with its own regulators, such as the automatic voltage regulator of synchronous generators, the torque control of permanent magnet synchronous motors and the current control loop of power converters. The paper illustrates also details concerning the practical deployment of the proposed models within the real-time simulator, in order to share the computational effort among the available processor cores.",

They are characterized by a significant amount of installed power necessary for the electric propulsion system and hotel services. Distributed power generation seems to be in principle a suitable solution, worth to be investigated, in order to pursue a superior flexibility and reliability, while complying with the applicable requirements for pollution reduction. At the same time, a superior electrical system complexity has to be taken into account as the inevitable downside. This is turn implies that a suitable power control strategy has to be included since the early ship design stage, in order to better capture the advantages of the distributed power generation system. In this paper the complete electrical system model of a cruise shipboard power plant with distributed generation is developed together with a methodology for its control strategy.",

To validate the approach, a set of experimental tests have been carried out on a real LV microgrid considering different configurations.

      "abstract": "The integration of fuel cell technology in shipboard is essential for real fuel and pollution reduction in the marine sector. This integration can be pushed in the adoption of a dc shipboard power system (SPS). One of the impediments to this integration is the necessity to couple fuel cells (FCs) and battery energy storage systems (BESSs) and control them with a proper power management system (PMS), in order to sustain high load variations due to electric propulsion. In the literature, all these aspects are dealt independently and mostly assuming ideal conditions. The proposed control strategies are derived from the droop and secondary frequency regulation of the ac power system. This paper starts with a brief description on the characteristics of dc SPS along with fuel cell and battery modeling. Subsequently, this paper describes the proposed control strategy. Finally, this paper shows the behavior and principle of the proposed integration and analyzes the performance on a real measurement test case of a ferry. This paper is concluded by identifying the future research for the development of a PMS control strategy for critical marine missions.",

Due to the increasing installation of distributed generation plants, distribution networks are acquiring an “active” role in the management of the overall power system. In this context, equivalent modeling is becoming essential for allowing transmission system operators to expand the system observability and improve the interoperability with distribution system operators. The present paper proposes a nonlinear model and an identification procedure able to take into account the prior knowledge of a given active distribution network. The result is an equivalent model, which can be easily adapted for reproducing the dynamical behavior of the network with different configurations.

      "abstract": "DC shipboard microgrids are currently of interest since several benefits can be obtained from their adoption. One of the most important challenges in this type of systems is related to sudden load events that demand significant amounts of power within a short period of time. This kind of events leads to large deviations in voltage magnitude at the main dc busbars. To cope with this problem the usage of storage systems has been identified as a possible solution. This paper proposes a control strategy, based on the participation of a battery energy storage system, that aims to reduce the voltage deviations. In order to carry out the proposed strategy, only few signals are exchanged among the converters, while the required measurements are usually available locally at the installed devices. The proposed strategy can be adapted to the usual schemes used for on-board microgrids in order to effectively mitigates the voltage deviations under sudden load changes, with the aim to ensure secure operations and to increase the stability of the system.",

      "abstract": "This work proposes a method to model, predict and simulate shipboard electric load power profiles for specific users in order to overcomes the limitations encountered with traditional methods applied at the design phase of the ship. A probabilistic characterization of the user's operating modes is proposed combined with a stochastic process called Hidden Markov Model (HMM) in order to model and simulate the load power profiles. Main inputs for the user's characterization are the initial state π of every user, the state transition probability matrix A<inf>i,j</inf> and, finally, the corresponding emissions at each operating state e<inf>i</inf>. All these inputs can be derived by the traditional information available from the electrical power load analysis (EPLA) or by experimental readings obtained through field measurements performed on-board ships. The method has been applied, tested and validated on a typical on-board laundry service of which experimental readings are available. The simulation of the load power profile shows a significant accuracy if compared with the recorder data (e.g. a mean absolute percentage error equal to the 11.1%).",

      "abstract": "The technological, economical and social changes of the last years had an impressive impact in the electrical energy world. The improvement in information and communication technologies, the liberalization of the energy market, the appearance of active customers and the growing spread of renewables have required to systems operators to recognize and manage new scenarios. Nowadays, it is globally accepted that distribution systems are the core of this change, which will lead to the realization of the smartgrid concept. As the key field of the transition is represented by the distribution system, the main role is played by Distribution System Operators (DSOs). They are asked to modernize their medium and low voltage networks and to adopt advanced control and management systems. Modern Distribution Management Systems (DMSs) answer this request, by providing a valuable and effective support to system operators, thanks to advanced functionalities, embedded on board, which support the exploitation of unpredictable resources (as renewable generation), controllable devices (distributed generators and storage systems) or active customers. In this context this paper aims to describe the implementation of a DMS for the real time control of a low voltage microgrid, focusing on the communication architecture and on the routine of the embedded advanced functionalities.",

      "abstract": "The work is focused on modeling and simulation of a supply vessel from static and dynamic perspectives in an integrated way. Modern marine vessels with electric propulsion are becoming more and more complex systems. Therefore, there is a strong necessity to develop models capable of integrating different subsystems in order to evaluate the overall performance under faults conditions, harsh weather, and other critical situations. In particular, the focus of this paper is to highlight the need to implement a zonal protection scheme to respect Dynamic Position 3 constraints in the case of severe busbar faults, operating the system with the main tie breaker closed. The model developed is characterized with a complete representation of a platform supply vessel. The model also represents the full protection system (static and dynamic) in accordance with fine-tuning conducted on the real system. In this paper, the innovative contribution is the investigation of the short-term dynamics after busbar faults with a detailed electric model of the full network taking into account zonal power system protections and load shedding actions. This paper is also focused on representing the electromechanical model of the propulsion power converters.",

Distribution System Restoration (DSR) is aimed at restoring loads after a fault by altering the topological structure of the distribution network while meeting electrical and operational constraints. The Spanning Tree Search algorithm is used to identify a post-outage topology that will restore the maximal amount of load with a minimal number of switching operations. The goal of the proposed tool is to determine the optimal switching sequences for the restoration process. The reliability indices incorporates contributions of all possible faults effects.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes a method to calculate the THD% value of the line-to-line voltage waveform at the PCC (Point of Common Coupling) in a shipboard system using an interconnection between Simulink and a power simulator, ETAP. Nowadays, electrical shipboard systems are more and more characterized by AFE (Active Front End) drives that allow more flexibility in the power drive but they can affect the power quality. In this work, a simplified electrical shipboard scheme is modeled in Simulink environment in which harmonics, created by non-linear loads, are recorded through the \"FFT Analysis Tool\". The converters are modeled in Simulink and they are controlled using a control scheme based on the \"d-q theory\". An analogue scheme is built in ETAP that can perform an harmonic load flow; in order to execute this analysis, Simulink provides a mask that contains harmonics of the current waveform for each non-linear load and these data can be used as input in ETAP. A comparison and a sensitivity analysis has been carried out using the THD% values and the harmonic spectrums collected in ETAP and Simulink in different power conditions to verify the proposed study.",

      "abstract": "The electric energy demand will increase in the future, and the will to exploit larger amounts of generation from renewable resources requires the development of new strategies to manage a more complex electrical system. Different techniques allow the smart management of distribution networks such as load shifting, peak shaving, and short-term optimization. This work aims to test, in a real low-voltage (LV) active network (LV test facility of Strathclyde University of Glasgow), a Microgrid Smart Energy Management System, which adopts a two-stage strategy. The two levels of the proposed energy control system are composed of: 1) midterm controller that, according to weather, load, and generation forecasts, computes the profile of the controllable resources (generation, load, and storage), the dispatch problem is then solved through an optimization process; and through 2) short-term controller, which controls the power absorption of the active network. This procedure is hierarchically designed to dispatch the resources/loads, according to priority signals with the objective to contain the energy consumption below predetermined thresholds. The scalability and effectiveness of the architecture, which is validated in a real test bed, demonstrates the feasibility of implementing such a type of controller directly connected to the LV breakers, delivering a part of a real smart grid.",

Measures, obtained from the simulated field through a communication layer, and pseudo-measures, defined according to load and generation models, are combined in different shares to observe the algorithm performances and the effects on the estimation quality. The work also investigates the necessity of a correct load modeling of Medium Voltage/Low Voltage (MV/LV) substations where distributed generation significantly contributes in altering the net power injection at the LV side. The implemented State Estimation (SE) procedure will be installed in a real MV network located in the North of Italy (Sanremo) within a research project. © 2013 IEEE.",
