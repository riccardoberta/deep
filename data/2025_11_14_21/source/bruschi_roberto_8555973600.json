      "abstract": "In order to satisfy the ethical requirements that are expected from upcoming 6G technologies, the knowledge of the power consumption ascribable to the applications and network functions is crucial to enforce a sense of responsibility and joint efforts towards value-driven sustainability. In this respect, this paper presents a modular, energy-focused prototype of the Management Data Analytics Function (MDAF), that represents the cornerstone of the Observability framework recently developed by the 6Green Project. Its main goal is to provide management data to upper layers (i.e., network and end-users/verticals). A 5G network was tested on both the User-Plane and Control-Plane; at the same time, said network was monitored by both the proposed MDAF and a common power monitoring solution: Scaphandre. Results show that the MDAF measures a higher power consumption than Scaphandre; the difference lies between 50% (when idle) and 4% (at the maximum offered load). This difference corresponds to the ”indirect” power consumption that the MDAF is able to ascribe to the containers/Virtual Machines (VMs) (i.e., the Network Functions (NFs)). The more accurate power consumption measurements of the single NFs is a first step towards the need to spread energy/carbon awareness to all the involved stakeholders.",

      "abstract": "5G delivers limitless mobile broadband capabilities, enabling extensive connectivity for various devices, including smartphones, sensors, and machines. Its most notable feature lies in its ability to facilitate instantaneous and highly reliable machine communications. Because of the rapid evolution of communication networks, innovative architectures such as Open RAN (O-RAN) have emerged, promising increased flexibility, efficiency, and sustainability. To realize the full potential of O-RAN networks, however, it is critical to understand their power consumption implications. In this paper, in order to understand the way O-RAN consumes energy, a comprehensive power consumption model is used. The study not only provides theoretical analysis but also incorporates a practical implementation of the architecture. For this, an algorithm is employed to determine a base monolithic architecture of O-RAN by the placement of Distributed Unit (DU) and Centralized Unit (CU) using available data of Radio Unit (RU) in France and Ireland. The research further explores the impact of different parameter variations in various Evaluation Scenarios (ESs) on the architecture. By conducting this thorough evaluation, this research provides valuable insights for researchers and industry practitioners to gain a deeper understanding of energy consumption patterns and derive ideas on how to effectively reduce power consumption in these networks.",

      "abstract": "Energy efficiency will be a crucial feature for the next mobile network generations (B5G and 6G). Therefore, in this paper, we have examined power management techniques to minimize the power consumption while not neglecting performance of the most power-hungry 5G Network Function (NF): the User Plane Function (UPF). A classical power management technique has been used herein: the low power idle. It allows power saving caused by putting the CPU to \"sleep\"(i.e., C<inf>x</inf> state) when not in use. Results show that, in most cases the deeper \"sleeping\"states are enabled, the more power is saved. This is especially true in the highest load scenario in which the power is more than halved as a result. However, results show that special care should be devoted to the enabling/disabling of the \"deepest\"sleeping state (C<inf>6</inf>) since the transitions from it to the active state (C<inf>0</inf>) (and vice versa) actually hinder the power savings. Finally, the performance (as in latency) has been also evaluated, results show no packet losses and small latency in all scenarios.",

This has also brought the increase in resource wastage and carbon emission. To this end, Edge Agility paradigm introduced by 6Green comes as a solution to distribute nodes across the edge-cloud continuum depending on demands. This is done by using enablers such as 'scale-to-zero', which exploits Kubernetes horizontal scalability, to better understand its impact on the energy consumption. This paper studies the connection between scaling pods from one to zero and vice versa and the power consumption of the CPU. Results show that scaling a pod to zero can decrease the CPU power consumption of the server by around 50 % for the application under test.",

      "abstract": "The emergence of 5G systems and beyond, along with state-of-the-art cloud and software engineering solutions, have brought to a radical shift of networking technologies with respect to the previous generations. However, the increased performance and flexibility have come at the cost of reduced sustainability, not only from an environmental standpoint but, in turn, affecting economic and societal sustainability as well. Infrastructure owners can introduce power management solutions in their datacenters, but the improvement is negligible unless tenant operating on top of the physical infrastructure are enabled and incentivized to customize their slices and their applications towards more energy efficient and carbon neutral profiles. For these reasons, the 6 G r e e n project has designed an Observability framework for estimating the energy consumption and the carbon footprint of an entire network slice, or of edge-computing applications attached to it. This paper highlights the rationale behind the 6 Green approach and provides a high-level description of the observability framework.",

      "abstract": "As mobile generations advance, blurring the lines between physical and digital worlds, the deployment of ultra-dense networks poses challenges in resource allocation and energy efficiency. This article revolves around the environmental sustainability of Fifth Generation (5G) and Beyond 5G (B5G) mobile networks as cloud-native technologies, highlighting the use phase. It aims to represent a monitoring, observability and analytical framework to devise a feature selection methodology within well-known monitoring tools, aligning with environmental sustainability objectives. Notable open-source monitoring applications (e.g., Kepler and Scaphandre) are employed to collect data on resource utilization and energy consumption for containers and physical servers. Dependence criteria indexes, Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) and Pearson, identify interdependencies among timeseries from different tools. Addressing challenges, the paper resolves inconsistent dataset lengths, highlights the Pearson-HSIC trade-off, and underscores the need for alignment in feature selection with compatibility to resource utilization. Key findings include Scaphandre's underestimation of memory impact on power consumption, Kepler's limitations in host metrics. Finally, the results enable the development of an anomaly detection mechanism.",

By exploiting a time-scale decomposition, we describe possible Call Admission Control (CAC) strategies that are based on a Stochastic Knapsack model over the space of flows that satisfy packet-level delay constraints.

      "abstract": "Industry 4.0 is evolving towards new challenging applications with tight reliability constraints. While simulation tools for the characterization of the physical and radio features of production environments would be very useful, there is a lack of awareness about radio propagation in the presence of 5G technologies. In this context, this paper presents a simulator, based on the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) TR 38.901 report, able to describe the physical layer, channel model, and channel modulation applied in 5G. The simulator takes as input the physical characteristics of the considered area and the objects inside of it and provides, with a two-layered approach, the time series of Block Error Rate (BLER) values according to the simulated propagation paths in the presence of moving objects followed by a reliability analysis of the gNodeBs with respect to the user position computed through statistical and geometrical calculations. Through our simulator, we have discovered that the current 5G technology systems may not be sufficient to meet the high reliability demands in safety applications in Industry 4.0 systems. This finding emphasizes the need for additional solutions to enhance the reliability of 5G technology in industrial settings.",

      "abstract": "The availability of networks able to perform control and management operations at unprecedented speeds is a crucial achievement for supporting next-generation Industry 4.0 applications. In particular, the presence of humans interacting with moving objects calls for decisions to be performed at time scales such as to ensure achieving the specific requirements identified by standardization bodies for the industrial sector in Beyond-5G environments. Among these specific Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), network reliability must be carefully pondered to guarantee the safety of the human operators at any time while investing the proper level of resources. For this reason, this paper presents an optimization problem that finds the best set of redundant radio bearers for each User Equipment (UE) in the factory area while accounting for the resource usage. Such problem extends the current specification on redundant transmissions. Several heuristics have been designed to achieve the desired time scales that could not be fulfilled with an exhaustive search. Results show that the optimization algorithm and the heuristics provide the same outcomes in terms of selected bearers and loss rates, but the latter do so at significantly more stringent time scales.",

      "abstract": "The 5th Generation of mobile radio communication systems (5G) is paving the way to applications characterized by unprecedented performance levels. Thanks to technological paradigms such as Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) and microservices, applications and network services, including the 5G core itself, can be deployed where and when required across the cloud-edge continuum to deliver the proper Quality of Experience (QoE) to users on the move. Since deploying and scaling applications/network functions can cause a waste of network and computing resources and a growth of costs for network operators, specific tools are required to identify current resource demands to fulfil user needs while minimizing the footprint on the underlying hardware infrastructure. The Network Data Analytics Function (NWDAF) was conceived for monitoring the edge and the cloud and producing Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) accordingly, but actual implementations are still lacking. This paper presents the design and development of an NWDAF prototype to be integrated in the core of a 5G network, to provide useful data for the horizontal scaling of the cloud-native microservices composing the 5G core. Results show that the prototype causes negligible overheads on the overall 5G core performance, with CPU additional usages averaging 5.5%.",

Simulating network delays and measuring the impact on data transmission allows network administrators and developers to test their systems in a controlled environment, mimicking real-world scenarios with different network conditions. This paper discusses the limitations of traditional packet latency emulators and the technical con-siderations required to test high-speed networks, and proposes a specialized packet latency emulator to replicate real-world network conditions. Results compare the proposed emulator with the best tools that are currently available and show a performance in line with the reference, with a significant accuracy improvement in the presence of higher latencies.",

      "abstract": "The Fifth generation(5G) technology moves a step forward from the previous generations by natively supporting vertical applications with real time and low latency requirements. However, the resultant increase of computing resources will cause a consequent increase in the energy requirement and an impact on the carbon footprint. To this end, it is of paramount importance to involve all the stakeholders leveraging on the 5/6G ecosystem, by making them aware of the impact of their applications and network services on the underlying hardware infrastructure and promote, through economic incentives, a new value chain that puts energy efficiency in the spotlight. To achieve this goal, monitoring tools are required to measure the performance and resource consumption at the infrastructure level and map it to the virtual images on top of it to infer the consumption ascribable to a vertical application or a network function. Specifically, this paper analyzes the resource and power consumption of a Kubernetes container, focusing on the breakdown of CPU usage, wakeups and power consumed by the individual kernel processes in the presence of traffic varying in load and composition. Experimental results compare an application by itself with its containerized counterpart and show that the latter requires much more time and effort to process data, and uses more resources compared to a stand-alone application.",

      "abstract": "Intent-driven orchestration enables organizations to achieve greater automation, integration, and intelligence of their compute and network resources by defining their objectives and policies in a more abstract and holistic way, while letting the orchestration system handle the coordination, optimization, and adaptation of the resources in response to changing needs and conditions. The trend for the development of intent-driven orchestration mechanisms has been growing in recent years as the deployment of distributed applications in the computing continuum has become more complex and diverse. In this manuscript we detail a novel approach for the management of distributed applications in the computing continuum. A hierarchical decision making scheme is proposed where an entity in a specific level of the hierarchy has the responsibility for the management of the overall application or a part of it, without having the control of all the management actions. The control is distributed across various entities that have to collaborate towards some joint objectives. Both compute and network resources management is considered that may be provided by the same or different infrastructure providers.",

      "abstract": "The diffusion of the Fifth-Generation (5G) of mobile radio networks will be the main driver in the digital transformation towards a new hyper-connected society. In order to satisfy the stringent demands of 5G-ready applications over the limited resources available at the edge, scaling mechanisms become crucial to guarantee the performance levels envisaged for 5G. Such mechanisms must be able to automatically perform according to the real-time user demands, the availability of computing resources and the state of Network Functions (NFs) and applications. In this context, this paper proposes a deep learning model, based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), for the dynamic and automated orchestration of NFs. The novelty of this model is its independence from specific 5GNF implementations; this is due to the nature of the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) used in this work, which are related to both execution environment (standard 'black-box' KPIs) and standard 5G APIs ('white-box' KPIs). Results obtained on the orchestration of a Session Management Function (SMF) reach an accuracy of 97∼ 98% for the training and validation phases and above 95% for the deployed model, as well as higher overall accuracy by ∼ 5% and computational resource savings with respect to a threshold-based scheme.",

      "abstract": "Network softwarization has paved the way for 5G technologies, and a wide-range of (radically new) verticals. As the telecommunications infrastructure evolves into a sort of distributed datacenter, multiple tenants such as vertical industries and network service providers share its aggregate pool of resources (e.g., networking, computing, etc.) in a layered 'as-a-Service' approach exposed as slice abstractions. The challenge remains in the coordination of various stakeholders' assets in realizing end-to-end network slices and supporting the multi-site deployment and chaining of the micro-service components needed to implement cloud-native vertical applications (vApps). In this context, particular care must be taken to ensure that the required resources are identified, made available and managed in a way that satisfies the vApp requirements, allows for a fair share of resources and has a reasonable impact on the overall vApp deployment time. With these challenges in mind, this paper presents the Resource Selection Optimizer (RSO)- a software-service in the MATILDA Operations Support System (OSS), whose main goal is to select the most appropriate network and computing resources (according to some criterion) among a list of options provided by the Wide-area Infrastructure Manager (WIM). It consists of three submodules that respectively handle: (i) the aggregation of vApp components based on affinities, (ii) the forecasting of (micro-) datacenter resources utilization, (iii) and the multi-site placement of the (aggregated) vApp micro-service components. The RSO's performance is mainly evaluated in terms of the execution times of its submodules while varying their respective input parameters, and additionally, three selection policies are also compared. Experimental results aim to highlight the RSO behavior in both execution times and deployment costs, as well as the RSO interactions with other OSS submodules and network platform components, not only for multi-site vApp deployment but also for other network/services management operations.",

Along with the enabling technologies of its predecessor, namely edge computing and network slicing, AI will realize intelligent communication and networking, but at a high risk of severely increasing the demands on computing resources and the related carbon footprint. In order to avoid such a curse, this paper proposes an AI framework allowing to achieve tight proportionality between the workload produced by vertical applications and network slices, and the energy consumption induced in the infrastructure, and enabling beyond 5G stakeholders to become part of a green business model. The paper outlines a high-level architecture able to support the framework, as well as the role of the algorithms composing it. Results show that the proposed framework allows for energy savings over 100% while fulfilling the application requirements.",

The SPIDER cyber range replicates a customized 5G network, enabling the execution of cyber-exercises that take advantage of hands-on interaction in real time, the sharing of information between participants, and the gathering of feedback from network equipment, as well as the development and adaptation of advanced operational procedures. This aims to help 5G security professionals improve their ability to collaboratively manage and predict security incidents, complex attacks, and propagated vulnerabilities. The SPIDER cyber range is validated in two relevant use case scenarios aimed at demonstrating, in a realistic, measurable, and replicable way the transformations SPIDER will bring to the cybersecurity industry.",

In this context, the paper addresses a 'smart sleeping' control problem, where computing resources in multi-core processors executing network functions are modelled as multi-server queues, and the number of active processing units (either physical or virtual) can be dynamically adjusted by parametric control over a time scale compatible with the long-term dynamics of the traffic flows that require processing. We show that, on average, up to 25% of processing capacity of a network node can be turned off in the presence of bursty traffic with low load without significantly affecting packet latency.",

      "abstract": "In order to fulfill the stringent requirements of 5G applications, measuring the performance of the VNFs composing the network slices is crucial to identify potential bottlenecks of the networks. However, since the VNF behavior is time varying and strongly depends on the infrastructure and hosting execution environment, the traditional traffic generators are not suited for the evaluation as their overhead, both in terms of deployment time and code complexity, may affect the results to the point of corruption. In order to overcome this issue, this paper presents a software traffic generator, based on TRex and executed in a VNF, which leverages on an automation framework to provide zero-touch as-a-Service active monitoring. Results show that the impact of this solution on the measured performance is negligible in terms of deployment time as well as required input lines.",

      "abstract": "The fifth generation (5G) of mobile networks is seen as a key enabler to support the introduction of digital technologies in multiple sectors, empowering different verticals and enabling new business models. Thanks to native capabilities of 5G networks, especially network slicing, edge computing and multi-tenancy, highly integrated telecom infrastructures with end-to-end flexibility will be realized to lower the barriers for creating 5G-ready applications that are able to satisfy business and user necessities. In this context, the MATILDA Project has established a holistic framework that unifies the development, deployment and operation for this new kind of applications. Since Edge Computing is not natively supported by 4G, in order to anticipate the technological improvements foreseen with the advent of 5G, as well as to smoothen the transition to the new technology, this paper describes the design of the end-point between the mobile and edge environments that has been integrated in the MATILDA telecom layer platform. Such end-point, designed in a Virtual Network Function (VNF), allows intercepting and forwarding data and control traffic towards external Data Networks. Instances of this VNF can be horizontally scaled according to a decision policy, which determines the minimum number of instances required for the current load. Results show that the latency ascribable to the VNF processing is sufficiently low to satisfy the delay budget for all 5G use-cases up to 10 ms and that a QCI-based decision policy allows scaling with the traffic load, while still fulfilling the performance requirements of each application.",

      "abstract": "5G is expected to bring forth disruptive indus-trial-societal transformation by enabling a broad catalog of (radically new, highly heterogeneous) applications and services. This scenario has called for zero-touch network and service management (ZSM). With the recent advancements in artificial intelligence, key ZSM capabilities such as the runtime prediction of user demands can be facilitated by data-driven and machine learning methods. In this respect, the article proposes a runtime prediction approach that transforms time series forecasting into a simpler multivariate regression problem with artificial neural networks (ANNs), structurally optimized with a genetic algorithm (GA) metaheuristic. Leveraging on a novel set of input features that capture seasonality and calendar effects, the proposed approach removes the prediction accuracy's dependence on the temporal succession of input data and the forecast horizon. Evaluation results based on real telecommunications data show that the GA-optimized ANN regressor has better prediction performance. It achieved average improvements of 59 percent and 86 percent compared to 1-day and 1-hour ahead forecasts obtained with state-of-the-art multi-seasonal time series and long short-term memory forecasting models, respectively. Furthermore, despite its longer training times compared to the baseline models, the proposed ANN regressor relaxes the monitoring requirements in 5G dynamic management systems by allowing less frequent retraining offline.",

Three feature sets (containing 20, 12 and 8 features, respectively) are evaluated at varying precision levels, showing interesting trends on the number of clusters, heatmaps and intra-cluster correlation.

      "abstract": "Since the adoption of virtualization paradigms is seen as a viable way to fulfil the requirements of next-generation applications in a sustainable way, this paper examines the virtualization of the Radio Access Network (RAN), focusing on the C-RAN architecture, in order to better understand the impact of NFV technologies on power consumption and costs in real networks. The evaluation compares the power consumption obtained by deploying the Base Band Unit (BBU) using commercial devices or pools of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs). Publicly available datasets describing the traffic and the eNodeBs have been used for the evaluation, as well as datasheets for both the commercial devices and the VNF pools. Results show that the usage of the virtualized BBU causes consumptions around 250% higher with respect to the commercial deployment, and operation and capital costs over 66% higher, contradicting the common belief of NFV being a 'green' technology. Further estimates conducted in this paper, however, highlight how the deployment of VNFs alongside specialized hardware solutions can represent a successful approach for telecom providers, with energy savings up to 20% and costs in line with the ones of dedicated hardware deployments.",

      "abstract": "While the integration of fourth-generation (4G) networks with Edge Computing technologies would anticipate the improvements foreseen by the coming of 5G, as well as smoothen the transition to the new technology, 4G does not natively support Edge Computing. Therefore, specific functionalities for user-plane integration and isolation of tenant spaces are required for effectively deploying Edge Computing in 4G networks. This paper describes the design of the end-point between the mobile and edge environments that has been integrated in the telecom layer platform of the MATILDA Project. Such end-point, designed in a Virtual Network Function (VNF), allows intercepting and forwarding data and control traffic towards external Data Networks. Instances of this VNF can be horizontally scaled according to a decision policy, which determines the minimum number of instances required for the current load. Results show that the latency ascribable to the VNF processing is sufficiently low to satisfy the delay budget for all 5G use cases up to 10 ms and that the decision policy based on the QoS Class Identifiers (QCIs) allows scaling with the traffic load, while still fulfilling the performance requirements of each application.",

      "abstract": "Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) has recently gained much popularity in the research scene for the flexibility and programmability that it will bring with the software implementation of network functions on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware. To substantiate its roll out, a number of issues (e.g., COTS' inherent performance and energy efficiency, virtualization overhead, etc.) must be addressed, in a scalable and sustainable manner. Numerous works in the scientific literature manifest the strong correlation of network key performance indicators (KPIs) with the burstiness of the traffic. This paper proposes a novel model-based analytics approach for profiling virtualized network function (VNF) workloads, towards real-time estimation of network KPIs (specifically, power and latency), based on an M<sup>X</sup>/G/1/SET queueing model that captures both the workload burstiness and system setup times (caused by interrupt coalescing and power management actions). Experimental results show good estimation accuracies for both VNF workload profiling and network KPI estimation, with respect to the input traffic and actual measurements, respectively. This demonstrates that the proposed approach can be a powerful tool for scalable and sustainable network/service management and orchestration.",

      "abstract": "Akey trend of current network evolution is in the direction of network softwarization and virtualization. These technological paradigms aim to enable a network to be programmable in a way that makes the network more flexible, scalable, and reliable, and in turn leads to agile service deployment and lower capital and operational expenses. So far, two related widely adopted solutions are software defined networks (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV). There is one main difference between these two new networking paradigms. SDN separates the control plane from the data plane through a well-defined programming interface, such that the centralized controller can have a complete view of the entire network, while NFV decouples network functions from dedicated physical equipment by means of virtualization technology, and runs the virtual network functions (VNFs) in the general purpose physical or virtual network appliances. Both approaches make the network programmable in order to have the aforementioned desired features. SDN and NFV do not depend on each other, and they actually complement each other. They can work well individually and can also work in tandem for performance reasons. Due to such advantages, both SDN and NFV have become key enabling technologies for 5G networks, and have also been used in a wide range of important areas including IoT, mobile edge computing, smart grid, cloud datacenters, and cognition-based networks.",

With the evolution of technologies and eco-system in 5G, it becomes not only more important but also more challenging to manage a large number of elements which have been connected and orchestrated to provide an end-to-end communication service across different segments of the network. This paper introduces a framework approach to define and evaluate latency in 5G based on the proposed 5G systems from four research projects. The use case and architecture are well studied to identify and analyse the contribution of latency. The proposed reference framework of latency is validated by mapping it to the testbed of these projects.",

Most of the 5G success will depend on the ability to attract vertical stakeholders acting in the cloud, enabling them to smoothly port cloud applications to 5G, and to add performance and cognitive capabilities not supported in cloud environments. To this end, this article provides an insight into the possible architectural approaches to fully integrate vApps into the 5G infrastructure. The article follows a top-down approach. First, it provides an outlook on the state of the art in cloud application design, and on the new MEC and NFV capabilities. Then, on this basis, the analysis is devoted to identifying integration issues not yet fully addressed in standards specifications. Two alternative architectural approaches are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Fifth generation (5G) mobile networks will lead to a deep integration between networks and applications. Through novel paradigms like network functions virtualization and edge computing, the new classes of heterogeneous application services will be enabled to run close to the mobile end-user devices with zero-perceived latency and fully-cognitive dynamic reconfiguration capabilities. Such \"vertical\" applications exhibit diverse performance/scalability requirements, and will rely on highly distributed, extremely virtualized, multi-tenant, and software-defined infrastructures. In such a context, handling the required operations in a scalable and dynamic fashion will be of paramount importance. A specific aspect, addressed by software-defined networking (SDN), regards the provision of suitable communication channels, once resource allocation mechanisms have performed the most efficient deployment of virtual network function instances, and VNF chaining needs to be implemented to enable network services. In this respect, this paper introduces the multi-cluster overlay (MCO) network paradigm: a tunnel-less SDN scheme for scalable realization of virtual tenant networks across the 5G distributed infrastructure, able to support (bulk) migrations of software instances among geo-distributed computing resources in a seamless and effective fashion. The numerical simulation and experimental results show that the MCO achieves up to over one order of magnitude smaller number of forwarding rules than the other state-of-the-art SDN mechanisms, while also assuring high performance during reconfiguration operations.",

      "abstract": "Low latency and integration with edge computing facilities are two of the main enablers of the upcoming fifth-generation mobile network. The geographical distribution of virtualized compute and storage resources (e.g., NFVI PoPs) allows to deploy application/service instances/components closer to mobile subscribers, and to provide much higher performance levels in terms of latency. These new degrees of freedom should be suitably managed in order to place and to migrate application components along with subscribers' move. Given the mass-scale of subscribers and the non-negligible overhead to move application components over resource-constrained edge facilities, this management should be performed in a highly scalable and effective way. In this respect, this paper presents the design of a comprehensive edge computing framework, including an orchestration algorithm, able to place and to move services in few milliseconds (<25 ms). The algorithm provides scalability levels able to support services instantiated on a per-user basis (i.e., personal services) also in the presence of complex network and service environments. The performance evaluation has been carried out by considering different service chains within diverse software live migration technologies.",

      "abstract": "The need for placing datacenter resources closer to the end-user is inarguable given the rise of computationally heavy services that have stringent latency requirements. This need becomes more straightforward in the expected proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) and for the forthcoming 5<sup>th</sup> generation (5G) mobile networks. However, in the context of Mobile Edge Computing, there is a lack of research activities about quantifying the important parameters that are helpful for the deployment of micro-datacenters (μDCs). For this reason, this paper provides an analysis of a citywide deployment of μDCs and an evaluation on how the different deployment scenarios affect both end-user Quality of Service (QoS) and Telco provider costs. In order to identify some guidelines to minimize such costs, the possibility of placing μDCs in the central offices hosting the Optical Line Terminals (OLTs) of the widely deployed Passive Optical Networks (PONs) has been explored. We utilized the publicly released dataset of the Milano Grid from the Open Big Data initiative and developed a simulation framework for user mobility that takes into account the effects of the user transitions on the generated traffic. Results illustrate the trade-off between the number of servers/power consumption and the per-user latency for varying μDC coverage area, and compare it to the deployment and energy costs ascribable to different ways of μDC dimensioning.",

      "abstract": "The envisioned 5G ecosystem will be composed of heterogeneous networks based on different technologies and communication means, including satellite communication networks. The latter can help increase the capabilities of terrestrial networks, especially in terms of higher coverage, reliability, and availability, contributing to the achievement of some of the 5G KPIs. However, technological changes are not immediate. Many current satellite communication networks are based on proprietary hardware, which hinders the integration with future 5G terrestrial networks as well as the adoption of new protocols and algorithms. On the other hand, the two main paradigms that are emerging in the networking scenario - software defined networking (SDN) and network functions virtualization - can change this perspective. In this respect, this article presents first an overview of the main research works in the field of SDN satellite networks in order to understand the already proposed solutions. Then some open challenges are described in light of the network slicing concept by 5G virtualization, along with a possible roadmap including different network virtualization levels. The remaining unsolved problems are related to the development and deployment of a complete integration of satellite components in the 5G ecosystem.",

      "abstract": "The upcoming Cloud-Fog interplay is expected to grant service providers more degrees of freedom in the implementation and management of their service portfolios. However, recent advances in Mobile Internet have developed a growing need to support user mobility - as users move, the Fog counterparts of services that require close proximity may call for migration(s) to meet the desired quality of service (QoS). With the state-of-the-art virtualization technologies, next-generation Cloud/Fog services are being implemented in modular software (i.e., as a graph/chain of portable virtual objects (VOs)) that can be migrated around the Telco infrastructure, and yet scalability is still an open issue, especially with the inter-datacenter bulk live migration of VOs. In this perspective, a VO clustering and migration policy that jointly considers user proximity and inter-VO affinity is proposed to scalably support user mobility, while allowing service differentiation among users. Results confirm that introducing migrations improve the QoS to always meet or exceed the requirements, as compared to static service placement, and considering VO clusters as aggregate entities will initiate around 40% less migrations, on average - an improvement that increases with inter-VO affinity and could potentially simplify service management when supporting user mobility.",

      "abstract": "Within a 5G mobile network scenario, this paper adopts Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) technological frameworks to evaluate the gain in terms of user Quality of Experience (QoE) that can be achieved when contents and server of a video delivery service move from the cloud at the edge of the Radio Access Network. The application scenario we set up envisions a video streaming service geared a small group of individuals who have strong social ties and who move in an urban space. The scaling up of this emergent type of social interaction is set to become in the near future highly demanding for the resources of mobile operators. The paper recreates the network infrastructure of a mobile operator in the city of Milano. We model network conditions through Mininet, and manage (computing, network and storage) resources by means of an orchestrator named OpenVolcano. The paper shows that, compared to the traditional cloud approach, a MEC one provides better QoE to group members simply taking advantage both of the proximity and distribution of mini data centers and of proper resource orchestration.",

      "abstract": "In the virtualized environment of 5G networks, the control and management of dynamic network slices poses a set of challenges that are still largely unsolved. Though the architectural framework and the elements of abstraction and orchestration mechanisms have been defined, the dynamic orchestration of resources based on them entails the adoption of existing sophisticated control techniques, or the design of new ones for the specific environment. In the present paper, we address the problem of load balancing among multiple network service chains (which represent network slice instantiations of a Network Service Provider referring to a specific vertical application) originating from different Points of Presence (PoPs). For scalability reasons, we want to maintain the problem within an informationally decentralized setting, where each PoP has the knowledge of the aggregate workload generated by the slice users accessing through it, but not of that of the other PoPs (to avoid the exchange of information for control purposes). By taking also into account power consumption policies of the Infrastructure Provider, we find a set of candidate team-optimal solutions to this load-balancing problem, which are characterized by piecewise-linear functions, and compare their performance with that of other resource allocation strategies.",

      "abstract": "In the last few years, network \"softwarization\" is gaining increasing popularity to achieve dynamicity and flexibility. Cloud computing, as well as the new paradigms of software defined networking (SDN) and network functions virtualization (NFV), are supporting this evolution. However, the need to move services closer to users to guarantee low latency in the service fruition on one hand, and the trend to support personalization of services on the other, are stimulating the migration of services toward edge nodes (in the so-called \"fog computing\" fashion). This is the target of the INPUT platform, proposed in the INPUT project to support future Internet personal cloud services in a more scalable and sustainable way, and with innovative added-value capabilities. The INPUT platform enables next-generation cloud applications to go beyond classical service models, and even replaces physical smart devices, usually placed in users' homes (e.g., set-Top-boxes, etc.), with virtual entities, providing them to users \"as a Service.\" In this paper, we present the INPUT paradigm and discuss a relevant use case-namely, the virtual set-Top-box-Adopted to prove the feasibility of the softwarized SDN/NFV paradigm jointly with the fog-computing approach for the support of personal cloud services. The INPUT platform is also compared with a legacy approach to evaluate the gain in terms of quality of experience for both static and mobile users.",

While looking into the different issues thrown at NFV, numerous works have demonstrated how performance, power consumption and, consequently, the optimal resource configuration and VM allocation vary with the statistical features of the workload - specifically, the 'burstiness' of the traffic. This paper proposes a model-based analytics approach for profiling (virtual) network function (VNF) workloads that captures traffic burstiness, considering - and adding value to - hardware/software performance monitor counters (PMCs) available in Linux host servers. Results show good estimation accuracies for the chosen PMCs, which can be useful to enhance current methods for finegrained provisioning, usage-based pricing and anomaly detection, and facilitate the way towards an agile network.",

However, a number of issues need to be overcome in order to deploy this new technology, which include scalability of user localization and data migration, along with new ways of interactions among the involved stakeholders. In this respect, this paper proposes an intercommunication layer that allows to isolate the physical resources while managing the migration of service instances according to the user's position. Moreover, the introduction of specific mechanisms ensure personal services are deployed in a lightweight fashion.

      "abstract": "By bringing Cloud-like services much closer to endusers and their devices, Fog computing is foreseen to expand the scope of overlay networks, encompassing different heterogeneity dimensions (i.e., size, geographical distribution, devices/virtual objects (VOs) involved, quality of service (QoS) requirements, etc.). Although highly flexible solutions like Software-Defined Networking (SDN) have been conceived to handle such heterogeneity in future networks, scalability is still an open issue, especially with respect to Fog computing requirements. In this paper, we propose an SDN-based network slicing scheme for supporting multi-domain Fog/Cloud services, which offers high scalability, among other aspects, over legacy ones. Results show that the number of unicast forwarding rules needed to be installed in an overlay drops by up to over one order of magnitude and 4 times compared to the \"fully-meshed\" and OpenStack cases, respectively, at the cost of possible path sub-optimality, albeit knowledge on the datacenter topology can be used for VO placement optimization.",

      "abstract": "The Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) paradigm is undoubtedly a key technological advancement in the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) community, especially for the upcoming 5G network design. While most of its promise is quite straightforward, the implied reduction of the power consumption/carbon footprint is still debatable, and not in line with the energy efficiency perspective forecasted by the ETSI NFV working group (WG). In this paper, we provide an estimate of the possible future requirements of this upcoming technology when deployed according to the virtual Evolved Packet Core (vEPC) use case specified by the ETSI NFV WG. Our estimation is based on real performance levels, certified by independent third-party laboratories, and datasheet values provided by existing commercial products for both the legacy and NFV network architectures, under different deployment scenarios. Obtained results show that a massive deployment of the current NFV technologies in the EPC may lead to a minimum increase of 106 % in the carbon footprint/energy consumption with respect to the Business As Usual (BAU) network solutions. Moreover, these values tend to increase at a very high pace when the most suitable software/hardware combination is not applied, or when packet processing latency is taken into account.",

      "abstract": "With the advent of network 'softwarization', Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) is foreseen to provide flexibility and programmability levels that would essentially help in coping with tomorrow's demands. However, energy efficiency and the resulting complexity of network/service management pose serious sustainability and scalability issues that may hinder NFV's advantages. This paper considers these aspects in the context of datacenter networks. We propose an energy-Aware resource allocation scheme to manage virtual machines, dedicated to perform certain (virtualized) network functions, among a pool of energy-Tunable physical resources (processors/cores). We use online measurements to periodically estimate some statistical features of the offered workloads by considering a fairly general renewal model that captures traffic bustiness and hardware operational settings. Then, resources are dynamically managed by jointly performing power scaling and in-server consolidation according to the actual workload variations. The average power consumption generated by this strategy is evaluated and compared with that of a classical bin-packing consolidation, over processors running always with the highest-performance configuration. Results show that the proposed approach can reduce the average power consumption of the datacenter by up to 10%, suggesting a considerable amount of annual savings.",

      "abstract": "Since energy efficiency has become a significant concern for network infrastructure, next-generation network devices are expected to have embedded advanced power management capabilities. However, how to effectively exploit the green capabilities is still a big challenge, especially given the high heterogeneity of devices and their internal architectures. In this paper, we introduce a hierarchical power management architecture (HPMA) which represents physical components whose power can be monitored and controlled at various levels of a device as entities. We use energy aware state (EAS) as the power management setting mode of each device entity. The power policy controller is capable of getting information on how many EASes of the entity are manageable inside a device, and setting a certain EAS configuration for the entity. We propose the optimal local control policy which aims to minimize the router power consumption while meeting the performance constraints. A first-order Markov chain is used to model the statistical features of the network traffic load. The dynamic EAS configuration problem is formulated as a Markov decision process and solved using a dynamic programming algorithm. In addition, we demonstrate a reference implementation of the HPMA and EAS concept in a NetFPGA frequency scaled router which has the ability of toggling among five operating frequency options and/or turning off unused Ethernet ports.",

Although this virtualization process can clearly bring to a reduction of the emissions, along with the lowering of capital (CAPEX) and operational (OPEX) expenditures, on the other hand it requires more computational capacity at server level, which may erase the savings produced by virtualization in the absence of a thorough management and planning. In this respect, this paper presents a mathematical model that analyzes the impact of different levels of virtualization on the overall energy efficiency by thoroughly outlining how the carbon footprint varies depending on the virtualization level of a device.",

In this respect, recent research projects were devoted to extending next generation networks, architectures and protocols in the green direction. This paper presents a complex demonstration network specifically designed to assess the viability and the real impact of green networking mechanisms on industrial prototypes. The demonstrator reproduces a complete wire-line network chain from the core devices to the subscriber terminals, integrating quite a few green mechanisms able to interoperate efficiently and achieve significant reductions in energy consumption. The experimental results and the ensuing impact analysis show how the aggregation of multiple devices with green capabilities can guarantee a satisfactory performance level, while also allowing huge energy savings.",

      "abstract": "Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) is a network architecture concept where network functionality is virtualized and separated into multiple building blocks that may connect or be chained together to implement the required services. The main advantages consist of an increase in network flexibility and scalability. Indeed, each part of the service chain can be allocated and reallocated at runtime depending on demand. In this paper, we present and evaluate an energy-aware Game-Theory-based solution for resource allocation of Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) within NFV environments. We consider each VNF as a player of the problem that competes for the physical network node capacity pool, seeking the minimization of individual cost functions. The physical network nodes dynamically adjust their processing capacity according to the incoming workload, by means of an Adaptive Rate (AR) strategy that aims at minimizing the product of energy consumption and processing delay. On the basis of the result of the nodes' AR strategy, the VNFs' resource sharing costs assume a polynomial form in the workflows, which admits a unique Nash Equilibrium (NE). We examine the effect of different (unconstrained and constrained) forms of the nodes' optimization problem on the equilibrium and compare the power consumption and delay achieved with energy-aware and non-energy-aware strategy profiles.",

We set up a complex test-bed that allowed us to perform a large number of measurements of energy-And network-performance indexes on a general-purpose computing system with power management capabilities, and the Linux operating system. The performed measurements gave us a chance not only 1) to provide a complete energy profiling of TCP connections, but also 2) to analyze the role of underlying network protocols in detail, and 3) to identify specific situations where current network protocols may trigger high inefficiencies in networked hosts. Based on the obtained results, we also conducted further experiments for evaluating techniques for reducing the energy consumption induced by TCP data transfers under different scenarios.",

      "abstract": "The continuing increase in demand for online and cloud services as well as the development of new more resource-intensive applications poses a significant challenge to the network infrastructure. The resulting rise in energy costs and ecological considerations have made it apparent that a future network infrastructure needs to be as energy efficient as possible, while at the same time flexible enough to handle the ever-changing traffic demands it is exposed to. This requires a flexible adaption of resources in the network devices themselves - the power management primitives - as well as a network-wide optimization of traffic loads. Software defined networking provides a way to introduce this flexibility into the network. This chapter illustrates how both approaches can be integrated to form an energy-efficient network management system.",

      "abstract": "The constant evolution and expansion of the Internet and Internet-related technologies has exposed the limitations of the current networking infrastructures, which are represented by the unsustainable power consumption and low level of scalability. In fact, these infrastructures are still based on the typical, ossified architecture of the TCP/IP paradigm. In order to cope with the Future Internet requirements, recent contributions envisage an evolution towards more programmable and efficient paradigms. In this respect, this paper describes the basic issues, the technical approaches, and the methodologies for the implementation of power management primitives in the context of the emerging Software Defined Networking. In detail, we propose to extend one of the most prominent solutions aimed at increasing networking flexibility, the OpenFlow Protocol, to integrate the energy-aware capabilities offered by the Green Abstraction Layer (GAL). However, the mere introduction of node-level solutions would be of little or no use in the absence of a network-wide management scheme to guarantee inter-operability and effectiveness of the proposed architecture. In this respect, this work also proposes an analytical model for the management of a network with these capabilities. The results will show how our solutions are well suited to provide a scalable and efficient network architecture able to manage the orchestration and consolidation of the available resources.",

In fact, recent studies showed that about 60% of the power consumption of a line-card is wasted to lookup the routing table during packet forwarding process. We first define the proposed approach, called Freezing Forwarding Functionality (F<sup>3</sup>). Then, we provide an ILP formulation of the energy minimization problem under <sup>F3</sup>mode and define a heuristic algorithm, referred to as Green Backbone Algorithm (GBA), to solve the problem in large networks. The performance of GBA is evaluated under different traffic scenarios in real ISP network topologies, and a comparison with the ILP solution is carried out for small networks. Results show that: (i) GBA performance, in terms of number of nodes in <sup>F3</sup>mode, are very close to optimal ILP solution ones; (ii) a large energy saving (up to 80% of nodes in <sup>F3</sup>mode) is obtained in large networks during low traffic hours; (iii) a limited impact on paths length increase is achieved.",

In the SIoT objects can establish social-like relationships between each others autonomously. In this paper a solution is presented that integrates the SIoT concept in the architecture proposed within the INPUT project. More specifically the feature is exploited of the INPUT project which allows for running the virtual representation of a smart/social object in the access router which is nearest to the physical object. In this way it is expected that delay will decrease and efficiency in the usage of network resources will increase.",

The flow of each user can be split among the different paths that traverse energy-aware routers. The routers adopt a specific strategy to minimize the power-delay product for each link, which gives rise to quadratic link (in the aggregated link flows) cost functions. We seek person-by-person satisfactory (p.b.p.s.) strategies stemming from a team optimal control problem of the users. The team optimization problem is defined among Decision Makers (DMs-one for each user) that try to minimize a common aggregate cost function of their routes, each one acting solely on the basis of the knowledge of the amount of flow to be routed. We derive piecewise linear p.b.p.s. solutions, which are characterized by a set of parameters. The latter can be found by solving a set of nonlinear fixed point equations.",

      "abstract": "Today's network architectures are not able to cope with the Future Internet requirements, as they are too inefficient, power hungry, and ossified on the TCP/IP paradigm. In order to promote a viable evolution towards new protocols and paradigms, modern network routers should become programmable to allow a flexible management of both traffic flows and power states. In this respect, Software Defined Networking (SDN) can represent the perfect support for the allocation of traffic flows and, at the same time, the management of the power states of the single nodes. To this purpose, this paper proposes to use the Green ion Layer (GAL) to integrate the exchange of power management data among network elements and the application of control strategies inside the SDN paradigm. Moreover, in order to clarify how our study would help overcoming scalability issues and promote energy efficiency at the same time, this paper defines and solves a consolidation problem where the network is described in terms of allocation of packet handling resources and power states.",

We assume a Forwarding Engine (FE) whose power can be scaled through Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) and Clock Gating (CG). In a typical architecture, data packets are always transferred at the maximum speed consuming the maximum power. We proposed to tradeoff energy efficiency and forwarding performance of the FE by acting on the power-delay product. To this purpose, we provide an optimization framework for dynamically adjusting the capacity of single server queuing system. Then, we design a practical AR policy, which can be easily extended for multi-core/multi-processor architectures. The performance evaluation revealed that a significant power reduction is experienced when using our policy, with a small increase of packet delays during low traffic condition and without compromising performance during peak hours.",

      "abstract": "This paper focuses on the energy efficiency of network-attached home devices, like PCs, tablets, and set-top boxes. These devices already include sophisticated power management schemes, which usually provide a good proportionality level between energy consumption and workload. However, they may become very inefficient in the presence of network-intensive applications and common residential access scenarios (e.g., DSL). As outlined by the experimental results obtained, the origin of this inefficiency fundamentally resides in the gap between (fast) working speeds of power management schemes, and (too slow) network packet inter-arrival times due to the limited bandwidth commonly deployed in residential access. Starting from these considerations, we designed, developed, and experimentally evaluated a simple traffic shaping mechanism, Burst2Save, aimed at mitigating this gap. The Burst2Save allows reducing the energy consumption induced by the network dynamics up to about an order of magnitude without affecting the Quality of Experience (QoE) of end-users under common realistic scenarios. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

      "abstract": "Multi-core processors optimized for networking applications typically combine general-purpose cores with offloading engines to relieve the processor cores of specialized packet processing tasks, such as parsing, classification, and security. Unfortunately, modern embedded operating systems still lack an effective and advanced hardware abstraction to exploit these aspects optimally. Based on these considerations, this paper proposes a novel framework, OpenFlow in the Small (OFiS), specifically designed to provide a flexible hardware abstraction layer for heterogeneous multi-core systems with advanced hardware accelerators for network offloading. OFiS represents such accelerators as standard OpenFlow switches inside the processor, moving the edge of the OpenFlow network management to the computational resources inside the end-boxes. As indicated in the experimental evaluation, OFiS exploits hardware parallelism and consolidates the software tasks at finer granularities.",

To this purpose, we started from an experimental characterization of the power management schemes in common device platforms based on commercial off-the-shelf hardware and open-source software (i.e., common PCs/servers devices running the Linux operating system). The characterization allowed us to formalize an analytical model able to accurately capture the power management dynamics at hardware (at ACPI level and beyond) and software levels (Linux Governors). Finally, the proposed model has been applied to analyze the efficiency of networked devices according to various configurations of internal parameters and incoming workload. Thanks to its intrinsic accuracy and the representation of different fine-grained details, the model is able to provide precious information on the possible sources of inefficiency, and on how to act on policy parameters to optimize the system behavior. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

      "abstract": "We consider a new generation of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Software Routers (SRs), able to effectively exploit multi-core/CPU hardware platforms. This choice was mainly driven from the fact that SRs are one of the few platforms including power management features, and that can be easily customized. Our main objective is to evaluate and to model the impact of power saving mechanisms, generally included in today's COTS processors, on the SR networking performance and behavior. To this purpose, we separately characterize the roles of both hardware and software layers through a large set of internal and external experimental measurements, obtained with a heterogeneous set of hardware platforms and SR setups. Starting from this detailed measure analysis, we propose a simple model, able to represent the SR performance with a high accuracy level in terms of packet throughput and related power consumption. The proposed model is thought to estimate how SRs behave under different network conditions and power management configurations. In fact, the model has been effectively applied inside a \"green optimization\" policy, which aims at minimizing power consumption, while maintaining a certain SR performance target. Finally, in order to provide an experimental evaluation of the proposed ideas, we apply such power management policies to a new generation software router platform, and we test their performance under real traffic traces. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, we focus on state-of-the-art packet processing engines, which generally represent the most energy-consuming components of network devices, and which are often composed of a number of parallel pipelines to 'divide and conquer' the incoming traffic load. Our goal is to control both the power configuration of pipelines and the way to distribute traffic flows among them. We propose an analytical model to accurately represent the impact of green network technologies (i.e., low power idle and adaptive rate) on network- and energy-aware performance indexes. The model has been validated with experimental results, performed by using energy-aware software routers loaded by real-world traffic traces. The achieved results demonstrate how the proposed model can effectively represent energy- and network-aware performance indexes. On this basis, we propose a constrained optimization policy, which seeks the best tradeoff between power consumption and packet latency times. The procedure aims at dynamically adapting the energy-aware device configuration to minimize energy consumption while coping with incoming traffic volumes and meeting network performance constraints. In order to deeply understand the impact of such policy, a number of tests have been performed by using experimental data from software router architectures and real-world traffic traces. © 2013 IEEE.",

To answer the need for increased energy efficiency of the network function virtualization paradigms, DROP includes sophisticated power management mechanisms, which are exposed by means of the green abstraction layer (GAL), under consideration for standardization in ETSI.

      "abstract": "Recently, a number of approaches based on dynamic power management techniques have been proposed to reduce the energy consumption of telecommunication networks and devices. They are able to optimize the trade-off between network performance and energy requirements. It is possible to execute and extend these techniques to the whole network, by using local control policies together with energy-aware routing and traffic engineering. However, the lack of a standardized representation of the energy-aware capabilities of heterogeneous networking equipment makes their deployment confusing and impractical. To this aim, we have proposed a novel framework, the green abstraction layer (GAL), whose purpose is to define a multi-layered abstraction interface for the hardware and physical resources, where energy management actions are directly performed. Therefore, the GAL syntax can be exposed to the platform-independent logical representation commonly used in network control protocols. Given the internal architectural complexity and heterogeneity of many network devices, the GAL approach is based on a hierarchical decomposition, where each level provides an abstract and aggregated representation of internal components. © 1979-2012 IEEE.",

The model is sufficiently flexible and accurate to consider different traffic parameters; among others, the packet size distribution, the average burst inter-arrival rate, the burst size distribution, etc. With relatively low complexity, since it addresses stationary queue behavior, the analysis allows obtaining the average energy consumption of the link and, unlike previous works, the mean latency time experienced by incoming packets in closed form, without any upper or lower bound approximations. This aspect makes the model suitable to be adopted in optimization frameworks for network design and control purposes.

      "abstract": "Dynamic power management techniques have been proposed in a number of recent approaches to reduce the energy consumption of telecommunication networks and devices. These techniques aimed at finding an optimal trade off between network performance and energy requirements. Control policies using energy-aware routing and traffic engineering can be used in order to extend these techniques to the whole network. However, the deployment of the energy-aware capabilities of heterogeneous networking is still unsystematic and impractical, as a standardized representation is still missing. To overcome such an issue, we introduce a novel framework, the Green Abstraction Layer (GAL), whose goal is to define a multi-layered abstraction interface for the hardware and physical resources. Within the GAL, energy management actions are directly performed. The GAL can be thus exposed to the platform-independent logical representation commonly used in network control protocols. Given the internal architectural complexity and heterogeneity of many network devices, the GAL approach is based on a hierarchical decomposition, where each level provides an abstract and aggregated representation of internal components. The general GAL architecture is currently under consideration for standardization in ETSI. © 2013 IEEE.",

To this end, we investigate and study a new open-source software (SW) framework: the Distributed SW ROuter Project (DROP), which aims to develop and enable a novel cooperative middleware for distributed IP-router control and management. DROP allows logical network nodes to be built through the aggregation of multiple SRs based on the Linux operating system and commodity hardware, which can be devoted to packet forwarding or control operations. In addition to the original ForCES design, DROP aims to extend router distribution and aggregation concepts by moving them to a network-wide scale to enable and support value-added services for next-generation networks. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

      "abstract": "In the last few years, the ever increasing attention to the eco-sustainability of Internet has pointed out the need of providing advanced power management schemes in network devices, in order to be able to reduce energy consumption according to the traffic load. In this context, starting from the observation that most of the traffic of today's Internet is carried by TCP, we focused on the impact that the dynamics of the TCP congestion control may have on energy efficiency of end hosts. In this paper we demonstrate that great energy consumption is related to network congestion conditions. Moreover, we propose to use a technique, called Active Window Management (AWM), with the aim of driving TCP sending rate according to the network available bandwidth, so improving congestion control and providing high TCP performance. AWM requires no changes to any TCP version. We demonstrate that the TCP traffic shaping performed by AWM allows a great reduction of the energy consumption in end hosts, with respect to the case where only TCP is used as congestion control. © 2013 IEEE.",

To this purpose, we set up a complex testbed that allowed us to perform several measurements on energy- and network-performance indexes. The reference device platforms that we selected for this evaluation are new generation software routers based on component-off-the-shelf hardware, since they already include advanced power management capabilities, and can be considered as a significant example for next-generation green network devices. The results collected in the measurement campaign allowed us not only (i) to provide an in-depth energy consumption profiling of SR data-plane, but also (ii) to clearly outline energy costs due to the use of low power idle techniques. Among other interesting aspects, we completely characterized the energy consumption due to wakeup transitions, which may cause instantaneous consumption spikes higher than 4 times the power energy requirement when active. © 2013 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Numerous studies have shown that datacenter networks typically see loads of between 5% - 25% but the energy draw of these networks is equal to operating them at maximum load. In this paper, we propose a novel way to make these networks more energy proportional - that is, the energy draw scales with the network load. We propose the idea of traffic aggregation, in which low traffic from N links is combined together to create H < N streams of high traffic. These streams are fed to H switch interfaces which run at maximum rate while the remaining interfaces are switched to the lowest possible one. We show that this merging can be accomplished with minimal latency and energy costs (less than 0.1W) while simultaneously allowing us a deterministic way of switching link rates between maximum and minimum. Using simulations based on previously developed traffic models, we show that 49% energy savings are obtained for 5% of the load while we get an energy savings of 22% for a 50% load. Hence, forasmuch as the packet losses are statistically insignificant, the results show that energy-proportional datacenter networks are indeed possible.",

In this way, the emptied physical elements may be put in standby mode, while their logical services may continue to work elsewhere.

We focus on a packet-processing engine within a switching node, where LPI and AR are applied in the presence of multiple services that require different processing times of the packet headers. Given a discrete set of processing times with their probabilities, we extend our previous modeling framework based on an M<sup>x</sup>/D/1/SET queueing system to take into account the presence of multiple service times.

To curb their energy requirements, next-generation hardware platforms of network devices are expected to include advanced power management capabilities, which may allow a dynamic trade-off between power consumption and network performance. At the same time, network protocols are going to evolve in order to carry energy-aware information, and to add them to classical performance indexes in network optimisation strategies. However, the question of how to map energy-aware indexes, often arising from low-level local hardware details, and the ones related to network performance is still an open issue. Starting from these considerations, we propose the Green Abstraction Layer (GAL), a device internal interface that provides a standard way of accessing and organising energy-aware information from the low-level hardware components to control processes. The GAL is specifically designed to hide the heterogeneous hardware implementation details, and to provide a simple, hierarchical, and common view of underlying power management capabilities to network control processes. © 2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Many network-based applications require full time connectivity of the hosts for fate sharing and responding to routine applications/protocols heart-beat messages. Past studies revealed that network hosts are most of the time unused or idle but still kept powered on just to maintain network connectivity. Thus, significant energy savings are possible if the network hosts can sleep when idle. Unfortunately, present low-power sleep modes cannot maintain network connectivity and results in applications state loss, thus preventing users from enabling power management features. A proxy-based solution was recently proposed in the literature that allows network hosts to sleep and still maintain their network standings over Internet while requiring minor changes to applications/protocols. The Network Connectivity Proxy (NCP) can handle some basic network presence and management protocols like ICMP, DHCP, ARP etc on behalf of sleeping hosts and wake them up only when it is truly necessary. This paper addresses NCP generic architecture and its requirements, main NCP responsibilities, different NCP types and their characteristics and some possible solutions to preserve open TCP connections for the sleeping hosts. It also describes key challenges in the design and implementation of NCP and proposes possible solutions. NCP can result in significant network energy savings up to 70% depending on the hosts time usage model. © 2012 Society for Modeling & Sim.",

      "abstract": "Numerous studies have shown that datacenter networks typically see loads of between 5% - 25% but the energy draw of these networks is equal to operating them at maximum load. In this paper, we propose a novel way to make these networks more energy proportional - that is, the energy draw scales with the network load. We propose the idea of traffic aggregation, in which low traffic from N links is combined together to create H < N streams of high traffic. These streams are fed to H switch interfaces which run at maximum rate while the remaining interfaces are switched to the lowest possible one. We show that this merging can be accomplished with minimal latency and energy costs (less than 0.1W) while simultaneously allowing us a deterministic way of switching link rates between maximum and minimum. Using simulations based on previously developed traffic models, we show that 49% energy savings are obtained for 5% of the load while we get an energy savings of 22% for a 50% load. Hence, forasmuch as the packet losses are statistically insignificant, the results show that energy-proportional datacenter networks are indeed possible. © 2012 Society for Modeling & Sim.",

      "abstract": "The energy consumption of the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector has been increasing recently; this sector is estimated to account for 2% of the total energy consumption. An even more aggressively increasing trend is the volume of Internet traffic and the number of connected devices. Thus, reducing the energy needs of the Internet is recognised as one of the main challenges that the ICT sector will have to face in the near future to reduce its overall energy footprint. Introducing energy-efficient techniques, both at the device level and the network level, is required. The main goal of this work is to quantitatively evaluate the potential energy savings from applying energy-efficient techniques, while examining the trade-off between network performance and the achieved energy savings. We introduce a categorisation of the energy-aware design space, focusing on the existing techniques in the device data plane, and contribute an analytical framework to represent the impact of energy-aware technologies and solutions for network devices. Our energy profile model represents the diverse energy-aware states of the network devices and is applied over two reference scenarios, one of a large-scale Telco (Telecom Italia) and one of a medium size Internet Service Provider (GRNET), to evaluate the impact of each energy-aware technology and the energy savings potential at the Home, Access, Metro/Transport and Core parts of each network. The results show the estimates of energy savings exceed 60% in many cases, while maintaining the same quality of service as in the energy-agnostic case. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

      "abstract": "The problem of reducing energy usage in datacenter networks is an important one. However, we would like to achieve this goal without compromising throughput and loss characteristics of these networks. Studies have shown that data-center networks typically see loads of between 5% - 25% but the energy draw of these networks is equal to operating them at maximum load. To this end we examine the problem of reducing the energy consumption of datacenter networks by merging traffic. The key idea is that low traffic from N links is merged together to create K ≤ N streams of high traffic. These streams are fed to K switch interfaces which run at maximum rate while the remaining interfaces are switched to the lowest possible rate. We show that this merging can be accomplished with minimal latency and energy costs (less than 0.1W total) while simultaneously allowing us a deterministic way of switching link rates between maximum and minimum. We examine the idea of traffic merging using three different datacenter networks flattened butterfly, mesh and hypercube networks. In addition to analysis, we simulate these networks and utilizing previously developed traffic models we show that 49% energy savings are obtained for 5% per-link load while we get 20% savings for a 50% load for the flattened butterfly and somewhat lower savings are obtained for the other two networks. The packet losses are statistically insignificant and the maximum latency increase is less than 3μs. The results show that energy-proportional datacenter networks are indeed possible. © 2012 ACM.",

      "abstract": "The energy management of computer hardware mainly relies on primitives defined in the ACPI industrial standard. Network devices can borrow the same concepts as a basis for their energy-efficient design; however, to effectively tailor network processors for their specific applications, the set of energy-aware states defined by the ACPI and their parameters should be carefully chosen. In particular when designing network hardware, one should address the problem of optimizing parameter values (most often chosen in a discrete set) to trade-off energy efficiency and network performance. In this paper, we provide a methodology for such choice, by investigating this trade-off over a continuous spectrum of parameter values. This approach will allow us to gain insight in the behavior of the optimal solutions that achieve different desired tradeoffs. © 2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The increased number of devices and links in today's backbones networks of Telecom, in order to maintain quality of service during busy or rush hour loads, has become in a critical factor for the power consumption in communication networks. Unfortunately, current network devices do not have power management primitives, and the energy consumption is largely independent of the load through the devices. Considering these points, we propose a viable approach to introduce and to support standby primitives in backbone network elements, which can be effectively used to almost halve the energy requirements of the whole Telecom core network. Periodic reconfiguration of nodes and links to meet incoming traffic volumes and operational constraints of real-world networks, such as reliability, stability, quality of service, and re-convergence times, is the main idea of the approach that we propose, exploring the main features of backbone device architectures, as well as the network protocol stack. © 2011 IIMC.",

Furthermore, old chargers, often not compatible with the new phones, are sent to dump too, adding up to the e-waste problem and increasing the costs for the end user. This paper reports an analysis performed on a wide number of mobile charger currently available in the market. In particular, such analysis gives the distribution of: output voltages and currents, type of connectors, efficiency, sizes, weights, etc. trying at same time to highlight the correlations (if present) among such variables and identifying the best available solution. Then, further studies based on LCA will also be presented, with the goal to analyze the mobile charger efficiencies and their related environmental impacts concerning the use phase as well as the manufacturing one.

Concern is due both to the impact on the environment and to the high costs caused by such energy consumptions. For these reasons, the scientific community is producing many researches to introduce power management capabilities in commercial network devices.

Such high energy consumption can be mainly ascribed to networking equipment designed to work at maximum capacity with high and almost constant dissipation, independent of the traffic load. However, recent developments of green network technologies suggest the chance to build future devices capable of adapting their performance and energy absorption to meet actual workload and operational requirements. In such a scenario, this contribution aims at evaluating the potential impact on next-generation wireline networks of green technologies in economic and environmental terms.

      "abstract": "The concept of energy-efficient networking has begun to spread in the past few years, gaining increasing popularity. Besides the widespread sensitivity to ecological issues, such interest also stems from economic needs, since both energy costs and electrical requirements of telcos' and Internet Service Providers' infrastructures around the world show a continuously growing trend. In this respect, a common opinion among networking researchers is that the sole introduction of low consumption silicon technologies may not be enough to effectively curb energy requirements. Thus, for disruptively boosting the network energy efficiency, these hardware enhancements must be integrated with ad-hoc mechanisms that explicitly manage energy saving, by exploiting network-specific features. This paper aims at providing a twofold contribution to green networking. At first, we explore current perspectives in power consumption for next generation networks. Secondly, we provide a detailed survey on emerging technologies, projects, and work-in-progress standards, which can be adopted in networks and related infrastructures in order to reduce their carbon footprint. The considered approaches range from energy saving techniques for networked hosts, to technologies and mechanisms for designing next-generation and energy-aware networks and networking equipment. © 2011 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Today, backbone networks of telecom operators deploy a large number of devices and links. This is mainly due to both redundancy purposes for network service reliability and resource overdimensioning for maintaining quality of service during rush hours. Unfortunately, current network devices do not have power management primitives, and have constant energy consumption independent of their actual workloads. Starting from these considerations, we propose a viable approach to introduce and support standby modes in backbone network devices. This approach can be effectively used to almost halve the energy requirements of the whole telecom core network. Our main idea consists of periodically reconfiguring nodes and links to meet incoming traffic volumes and operational constraints of real-world networks, such as reliability, stability, quality of service, and reconvergence times. To this purpose, the approach we propose directly exploits the main features of both backbone device architectures and the network protocol stack. © 2006 IEEE.",

In order to dynamically adapt such energy requirements to the real device work load, current approaches foster the introduction of low power idle and power scaling primitives in entire devices, internal components and network interfaces. Starting from these considerations, we propose an analysis of the theoretical and technological limitations in adopting such kind of mechanisms. The results achieved show that the power scaling allows a linear trade-off between consumption and network performance, but the time to switch between two power states may cause a non negligible service interruption. © 2010 ACM.",

      "abstract": "The largest part of routers and switches, today deployed in production networks, has very limited energy saving capabilities, and substantially requires the same amount of energy both when working at full speed or when being idle. In order to dynamically adapt such energy requirements to the real device work load, current approaches foster the introduction of low power idle and power scaling primitives in entire devices, internal components and network interfaces. Starting from these considerations, we focus on power scaling, and we propose an analysis of the theoretical and technological limitations in adopting such kind of mechanisms. Thus, our contribution is twofold. On one hand, we performed several tests to identify the technological limitations in a software router based on off-the-shelf hardware, which already includes such capabilities. The results achieved show that the power scaling allows a linear trade-off between consumption and network performance, but the time to switch between two power states may cause a non negligible service interruption. On the other hand, regarding the theoretical limitations, we consider the trade-off between the benefit in dynamically adapting the power states within short time-scales and the overhead needed to choose and select the new power state. ©2010 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Due to the continuous growth of customer population, the spreading of broadband access, the increase in energy price, and the expanding number of services being offered by telecoms and providers, energy efficiency issue has become a high-priority objective for wired networks and services infrastructures. Current network devices are well-known to be over-dimensioned for rush-hour traffic loads, and to have Oat energy requirements with respect to their real utilization. Recent studies suggested to reduce the energy consumption of networks and networked devices through the introduction of adaptive capabilities, which allow to modulate energy requirements according to network-aware performance (i.e., delays, packet losses, etc.). However, at the today's state of the art, the real impact of these power management techniques is not clear, and requires further studies and researches. Based on this context, we focus on development of a new simulator called \"GreenSim\", that aims at analyzing and evaluating the impact of adaptive energy saving techniques both on network- and energy-sides in the presence of real traffic traces and data. The results achieved with the proposed simulator demonstrate that these green technologies, when applied to packet processing engines inside network devices, can save up more that 40% of energy consumption in the presence of real Internet traffic profiles, while maintaining an acceptable network performance level.",

The proposed framework combines together suitable TCP and network layers' models to effectively represent both the steady-state backbone network behavior and the performance level perceived by users. In Our approach is composed by three different analytical models working at different aggregation and logical levels, which interact to compute the most relevant performance indexes. The global computational effort is so low that it can be effectively used inside iterative optimization procedures for high speed networks.",

However, despite of their diffusion, the analysis of teletraffic generated by these applications in real-time environment remains an open issue. In this paper we look at analytical and simulation models, which can be used for quantifying volumes of P2P teletraffic at the network layer, to ease still existing difficulties associated with monitoring such teletraffic. We present an event-driven simulator, able to simulate P2P teletraffic both at the application and network layers in large overlay networks (we have successfully tested it in networks used by up to 500,000 peers). The simulation model was developed for studying the impact that P2P systems have on the network layer performance. We studied also the application layer dynamics by looking at time evolution of file-downloading processes and at the offered load generated in such networks. We report the results of several simulation scenarios, in which we focused on the consequences such teletrafflc has on the Internet access link of an enterprise network.",

      "abstract": "A multiservice IP Virtual Private Network is considered, where Quality of Service is maintained by a DiffServ paradigm, in a domain that is supervised by a Bandwidth Broker (BB). The traffic in the network belongs to three basic categories: Expedited Forwarding (EF), Assured Forwarding (AF) and Best Effort (BE). Consistently with the DiffServ environment, the Service Provider's Core Routers (CRs) only treat aggregate flows; on the other hand, the user's Edge Routers (ERs) keep per-flow information and convey it to the BB. The latter knows at each time instant the number (and the bandwidth requirements) of flows in progress within the domain for both EF and AF traffic categories. A global strategy for admission control, bandwidth allocation and routing within the domain is introduced and discussed in the paper. The aim is to minimize blocking of the \"guaranteed\" flows (EF and AF), while at the same time providing some resources also to BE traffic. In order to apply such control actions on-line, a computational structure is sought, which allows a relatively fast implementation of the overall strategy. In particular, a mix of analytical and simulation tools is applied jointly, by alternating \"local\" decisions, based on analytical models, with flow-level simulation that determine the effect of the decisions on the whole system and provide feedback information. The convergence of the scheme (under a fixed traffic pattern) is investigated and the results of its application under different traffic loads are studied by simulation on three test networks. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

P2P traffic stresses network infrastructures with highly dynamic and distributed traffic matrices, whose vertices heavily depend on the overlay network and on the query mechanism adopted. Two of the most important characteristics of real P2P systems are the huge number of peers and their very dynamic behavior. In this respect, our aim is to propose a simulation approach capable to represent the peers' and files' dynamics in very scalable way. This approach is able to give indications about the file distribution behavior and queries' success percentage along time and to support network managers or traffic modeling tools in determining the impact of P2P applications on transport networks. Simulation results are reported which show the ability of the system of representing overlay networks of about 250000 peers.",

The link bandwidth allocation in the network is based on a hybrid combination of analytical and simulation models. The allocation tool works in three phases: phase 1 and 2 deal with the assessment of the capacities needed to satisfy requirements for QoS and BE traffic individually; the effects of multiplexing gains arising from traffic mixing are taken into account in phase 3. There are two analytical parts, based on a simplified version of call-level traffic models, derived from teletraffic theory of circuit-switched networks, and on an algorithmic procedure to compute the distribution of average values of BE traffic flows, respectively. The same algorithm is used inside a fast simulation model, adopting a fluid representation of TCP traffic aggregates.

      "abstract": "Dynamic-routing in a packet-switched telecommunication network with Quality of Service (QoS) capabilities is addressed. The problem is posed in an informationally decentralized (team) setting, where routing and scheduling decisions are combined. Such decisions are taken at the network nodes, on the basis of local information and possibly of some data received from the neighboring nodes, with the common goal to minimize the expected total delay, spent by packets in traversing the network. Stationarity of the control strategies over an infinite optimization horizon (in the presence of no changes in the traffic parameters and network topology) is achieved by considering an approximation based on a receding-horizon approach. Optimal strategies in this setting are in turn approximated by means of feed-forward neural networks. The problem is posed and a computationally decentralized algorithm for its numerical solution is described. A specific numerical example is also considered, where the neural approximators are tuned, and then used in constructing dynamically varying routing tables and scheduling coefficients in a network simulation based on ns-2, where the gain of the dynamic strategies is evaluated, over an adaptive routing approach based on the measurement of aggregate traffic parameters. © 2005 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The planning of a Virtual Private Network, carrying both Quality of Service (QoS) and Best-Effort (BE) traffic is considered in the paper, and a hybrid analytical/simulation tool for link bandwidth allocation is proposed and tested. The tool works in three phases, related to assessing the capacities needed to satisfy requirements for QoS and BE traffic individually, and to take into account the effects of multiplexing gains arising from traffic mixing, respectively. The analytical part is based on a simplified version of call-level (circuit-switched) traffic models; the simulation model is a fast one, based on a fluid representation of TCP traffic aggregates. The tool is tested both on simple networks and on a more complex real national backbone. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.",

      "abstract": "The dynamic-routing problem in a packet-switching telecommunication network is addressed by a receding-horizon approach. The nodes of the network must accomplish the following tasks: i) generating routing decisions to minimize the expected total delay, spent by messages in the network, on the basis of local information and possibly of some data received from the neighboring nodes; ii) computing their routing strategies by measuring local variables and exchanging a small amount of data with other nodes. The first task leads to regard the nodes as the cooperating decision makers of a team organization. The second task calls for a computationally distributed algorithm. To solve this team optimal control problem two main approximating choices have been done: 1) the use of a receding-horizon framework, and 2) the use of a given structure for each decision maker, in which a finite number of parameters have to be determined to optimize the packet routing. Among the various possible fixed-structure functions, feed-forward neural networks have been chosen for their powerful approximation capabilities. The neural approximation of such team-optimal routing strategies is computed in a numerical example, and used in network routing simulations performed by means of NS-2, in order to show the feasibility and effectiveness of the methodology.",
