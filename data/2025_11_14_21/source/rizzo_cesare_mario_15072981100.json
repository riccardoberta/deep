      "abstract": "Many studies have been conducted to determine the ultimate strength of axially loaded ship structures at different levels of complexity, considering grillages, stiffened panels, transverse ring frames as well as complete hull blocks, aimed at assessing progressive collapse analysis of the whole hull girder, both analytically and numerically. However, little research has been conducted on the effects that transversal loads can have on relatively thin shell plating, particularly sensitive to buckling phenomena even for rather low loading thresholds. Moreover, the more and more frequent use of higher and higher strength steels makes ship structures slender and, consequently, likely to be even more sensitive to buckling phenomena. In the framework of a research project funded by Fincantieri R&D Department, a full-scale experimental test is performed on a structure simulating a deck portion characterized by a relatively thin plating, such as to induce an early local elastic buckling with a wide post-buckling range, before the ultimate load is reached. Nonlinear finite element analysis is carried out to design the experiment, considering both the nominal and the actual geometry of the structure as obtained by laser scanning the plating and by 3D reconstruction of the stiffeners. The effect of initial plating imperfection and of welding residual stresses on the numerical models has been considered as well, verifying their impact both, on the load end-shortening curve and on the ultimate strength of the panel.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, the maritime technology and shipbuilding industry, including yachts and pleasure crafts as well as marine structures, have faced significant challenges, such as technological advancements, environmental sustainability, and global competitiveness. This article presents a comprehensive investigation conducted within the European project LeaderSHIP, focusing on the current state of training programs for workers in the sector and specifically identifying emerging and urgent skills necessary for future success. Using a mixed-methods approach, data were collected through surveys distributed to industry professionals, educational institution representatives, and companies. The results highlight a disparity between the skills demanded by employers and those provided by training programs. Notably, the investigation reveals critical gaps in essential areas such as sustainable design, technological innovation, and resource management, underscoring the need for immediate action. The analysis emphasizes the importance of continuous updating and a closer alignment between academia and industry. It suggests that collaboration between educational institutions and businesses could significantly enhance training quality. Implementing practical learning programs and internships, along with creating flexible curricula that can adapt to the sector's dynamic needs, is proposed as a vital strategy to address these gaps. Finally, the article discusses future perspectives for training in maritime technology, stressing the necessity to invest in advanced skills and foster a culture of innovation. This study provides valuable insights for policymakers, educators, and entrepreneurs, highlighting the critical need for an integrated approach to effectively tackle the challenges posed by emerging and urgent skills in the shipbuilding industry.",

      "abstract": "When it comes to composite materials, a fundamental difference arises from the isotropic materials, contrary to the latter case, the stratified nature of composites inevitably generates anisotropy in the structural behavior of the laminates. Instead of two independent variables as for steel or aluminum, glass-reinforced plastic (GRP) requires at least five independent variables, that are calculated upon micromechanics assumptions. This article evaluates the accuracy of a method based on the Classical Laminate Theory to calculate the equivalent laminate properties in computing the natural frequencies of structures in GRP yachts. Natural frequencies are evaluated beforehand with the results of the beam theory, subsequently, Experimental Modal Analysis (EMA) is conducted to validate the analytical results, being a benchmark for comparison. The study aims to assess the validity of a laminate equivalent mechanical properties method when used to determine the natural frequencies, reducing the time needed in the preprocessing phase of most common FEM software.",

      "abstract": "The proposed work describes a procedure for sizing primary structural elements in the initial phase of ship design, with the aim of determining the maximum dimensions of the lightening holes usually found in the webs of beams, which are also necessary for the passage of plant components. The objective is to simplify the process for a more effective and integrated result from the earliest stages of design. In particular, the dimensioning of a ship's hull, although a complex problem, is often governed by a few independent variables with often limited ranges of variation. The optimal choice is therefore obtained by systematically analyzing and comparing the solutions that are actually feasible in practice. The systematic analysis will provide designers with rational data for choosing the dimensions of the beams, with a view to finding the best solution in terms of weight-strength and maximum size of the lightening holes. The study combines analytical and numerical methods with design experience, integrating the results into the design process using a VBA code.",

      "abstract": "Underwater explosions can cause severe damage not only to on-board equipment, but also to their foundations, whose structural properties are critical to ensure the efficiency of the entire foundation-equipment system. Generally, it is not always possible to ensure compliance with shock requirements through experimental tests, therefore, national regulations also allow verification through calculation. In particular, a dynamic analysis using finite element software is accepted. However, the regulations do not specify in detail the modeling strategies and procedures for the calculation inputs. This paper outlines some useful guidelines in the design phase for shock verification. The validation of the proposed modeling methodology is obtained by comparing the results of numerical simulations with experimental tests data, specifically designed and realized using the medium-weight impact machine (MIL S 901 D). Once again, the parallel use of numerical and experimental analyses is essential to better understand such complex phenomena.",

      "abstract": "In various fields of industrial engineering, including naval architecture, structural design is considered one of the most challenging steps by designers as it shall accommodate all other design aspects, likely already defined in earlier steps. Moreover, structures need to comply with specific requirements, i.e. limit states, while also performing in accordance with user's demands in terms of mission profile. In a goal-based design perspective, limit state criteria have to be defined accounting for both, structural robustness, functional and operational demands. Construction feasibility is an issue as well, further constraining the scantling design. Balancing construction needs, ship performances and structural aspects is not always an easy task. The environment in which a ship operates is indeed complex and verification of safety and robustness is usually carried out in accordance with classification societies and other rules, possibly applying direct calculations whenever applicable rules do not provide suitable solutions. At the same time, the asset needs to fulfill various attributes specified by the owner. As a matter of facts, the scantling design is mathematically a multivariate and over-constrained problem whose feasible solutions are in fact rather few. In the case of composite pleasure craft hull structures, while the number of design variables increases, feasibility constraints also largely reduce the design space. To address these challenges, designers may nowadays exploit new procedures able to reduce structural weight, though ensuring that the asset performs safely and adequately meeting client's requirements. To achieve this, designers may combine a more rational design philosophy with currently available numerical problem-solving applications to obtain a rational trade-off among all actually feasible solutions, which are relatively few. Thus, the objective of this study is to present a dependable numerical method for determining the scantling while reducing the weight of hull composite structures of pleasure crafts. This method aims to provide the most suitable, high-performing, and safe layout in the quickest and easiest possible manner. It turns out that counterintuitive, yet feasible and fit-for-purpose, structural lay-outs can be obtained.",

      "abstract": "Despite the non-contact underwater explosion phenomena (UNDEX) have been studied for decades and several numerical methods have been proposed in literature, its effects on military structures, especially composite ones, are even nowadays matter of research. In early design phases, it is not always possible to verify the shock resistance of hull structures modelling the whole phenomenon, in which fluid, gas and solid properties must be properly set in a fully coupled fluid-structure interaction (FSI) numerical model. These ones are extremely complex to set, computationally demanding and certainly not suitable for everyday design practice. In this paper, a simplified finite element (FE) model, easy to use in an early design phase, is proposed. Both, the structure and the fluid are simulated. In this approximation, the fluid behaviour is simplified, using special finite elements, available in a commercial software environment. This choice reduces the computational time and numerical efforts avoiding the problem of combining computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and FE domains and equations in a fully coupled fluid-structure interaction model. A typical parallel body block of a minesweeper is modelled, using two-dimensional multi-layered shell elements to properly account for the composite materials behaviour. For the fluid instead, three dimensional volumetric elements, directly coupled to the structural elements, are placed. In addition, the same calculation is performed, modelling separately fluid in the CFD environment and structures in the finite element one. Thus, realizing a fully coupled fluid-structure interaction model. The results obtained by applying both numerical models are compared with the structural response measured on board of a composite ship during a full-scale shock test. The simplified proposed procedure provides results in satisfactory agreement with experiments, allowing the validation of the model. Approximations are discussed and differences with the real phenomenon and fully coupled CFD+FE method are shown, providing a better understanding of the phenomena. Eventually, the modelling strategy has been considered a valuable and cost-effective tool for the concept and preliminary design of composite structures subject to underwater explosions.",

      "abstract": "Measurement of transient pressure distribution on maritime structures is important for the assessment of the hydrodynamic loads applied. The commonly used pressure sensors are mostly bulky, need to be bolted to the structure, and/or only provide point-wise measurements. In this paper, an elastic matrix layer with a network of embedded piezoelectric sensors is proposed to address these issues. For experimental validation, a 400 × 400 × 5 mm epoxy layer is fabricated embedding 25 piezoelectric sensors on a square grid in accordance with Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre points. A finite element based inverse procedure is developed to reconstruct the pressure field from the electric potentials measured by the piezoelectric transducers. Feasibility of the concept is evaluated by measuring and reconstructing the pressure field generated by a travelling wave in a water tank. Sensitivity of the layer is also investigated through the experiments. The results indicate that the retrofit layer is capable of pressure field reconstruction, and that the presence of disturbances on the sensing surface does not affect the measurements in a notable way, while non-ideal conditions of the mounting can have a significant impact on the accuracy of the measurements. The results highlight the potential of the concept in pressure distribution measurements.",

      "abstract": "Non-contact underwater explosions (UNDEX) can cause extremely large deformations on naval composite structures related to heavily nonlinear phenomena. For this reason, for military purposes, used materials must have excellent shock resistance properties. Historically, the underwater shock transient effects on fiberglass laminates are predicted using quasi-static approaches. In this paper, the composite materials are characterized by experimental modal analysis as well as by a comprehensive series of shock tests, whose results are compared with numerical models. Namely, the MIL S 901 D Medium Weight Shock Machine (MWSM) was used to perform dedicated shock tests, in which composite specimens are supported on a special constraining structure designed to create large deflections and providing reproducible results. A dynamic implicit finite element model has been set, validated by modal analysis at first, and then applied to simulate the MWSM test behavior and to predict the structural response of different E-Glass polyester resin laminates. In the end, the complete comparison of numerical results and experimental data is reviewed to validate the modeling strategies for shock design of navy ships.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, a semi-automatic design procedure for concept and preliminary phases of hull structural design is described. It allows investigating the design of ship structures, consisting of a series of stiffened panels surrounded by primary members, assembled to form the hull girder. The optimal configuration of the structural lay-out and the best scantling of each structural component (i.e. platings, ordinary stiffeners and primary elements) is provided, accounting for interactions among all structural components as well as integration of primary, secondary and tertiary responses. The proposed method allows the minimization of the overall weight of hull blocks intended as the sum of stiffened panels’ weight (shell and stiffeners) plus that of the surrounding primary members. A dedicated application in VBA language (Visual Basic for Applications) has been developed in which scantling checks have been implemented by applying a few rules formulations after a comprehensive analysis of involved variables defining the state of the hull structural system. The proposed scantling design approach is very practical, it follows well-known hull structural design principles and it takes advantage of the nowadays widely available computation means to update the traditional sequence of the scantling checks in a more rational way and to select the optimal lay-out scantling solutions among truly feasible ones.",

      "abstract": "Goal based and limit state design is nowadays a well-established approach in many engineering fields. Ship construction rules started introducing such concepts since early 2000. However, classification societies’ rules do not provide hints on how to verify limit states and to determine the structural layout of submerged thin-walled stiffened cylinders, whose most prominent examples are submarines. Rather, they generally offer guidance and prescriptive formulations to assess shell plating and stiffening members. Such marine structures are studied, designed and built up to carry payloads below the sea surface. In the concept-design stage, the maximum operating depth is the governing hull scantling parameter. Main dimensions are determined based on the analysis of operational requirements. This study proposes a practical concept-design approach for conceptual submarine design, aimed at obtaining hull structures that maximize the payload capacity in terms of available internal volume by suitably adjusting structural layout and stiffening members’ scantling, duly accounting for robustness and construction constraints as well as practical fabrication issues. The proposed scantling process highlights that there is no need of complex algorithms if sound engineering judgment is applied in setting down rationally the hull scantling problem. A systematic approach based on a computer-coded procedure developed on purpose was effectively implemented and satisfactorily applied in design practice.",

      "abstract": "This report reviews the recent advances of the past years in ships and offshore structural testing area including scaling laws, DIC, hydrodynamic of flexible structures, wave-in-deck, hybrid model testing, corrosion testing, iced load measurements, health monitoring model and digital twin model. The following summary and recommendations are made for future work in the area of innovative experimental methods in ships and offshore industry. It is important to also note that as experimental techniques allow for a greater understanding of the underlying material and structural behaviour, and generate extensive data clouds for processing and evaluation. As a result, we recommend that a future chapter in the next committee report focus on data evaluation and statistical approaches; this can provide an in-depth look of state of the art of processes utilized for evaluating the extensive data captured/utilized during experiments. In chapter 2, a review of scaling laws is presented in systematic and recent advancements in structural testing related to ships and offshore structures. General scale modelling methods are provided and described the main characteristics of each method such as dimensional analysis, applied to governing equation, energy method, empirical similarity method through the literature review. Recent application of scale models can be found in field of offshore wind turbine structure and ice testing area. These structures are subjected to complex phenomena such as wave loads and drifting forces may also need to be considered in particular applications, ice flows, continuous winter sea ice, and icebergs. Application DIC in chapter 3, DIC techniques have certainly come into play in many recent experimental evaluations, as the methods allows for elucidating the surface strain behaviour of a component evaluated either in the laboratory and in the field. This chapter has been to give an updated review on applications of DIC techniques in ships and offshore structural tests classifying them by test articles, with a brief insight on commercial instrumentations available on the industry and related to DIC society and a deeper focus on the applied methodologies, providing recent references for those who are interested in this topic. Worth mentioning is that some DIC applications are included in the benchmark study performed by the Committee and reported in section 15. In chapter 4, A large amount of research has focused on better measuring and predicting the hydrodynamic loads, forming several practical hydrodynamic coefficients databases which have been widely used in VIV prediction tools for flexible structure manufacturing industry. Although these databases make great contributions to the field of VIV research, have not been sufficiently modelled in the coefficient database obtained from rigid cylinder experiments. Recently, the phase angle between cross-flow and in-line response had a strong influence on the hydrodynamic coefficients for both rigid and flexible cylinders. And variations of tension and flow velocity were strongly correlated with time-varying hydrodynamic coefficients, therefore, inputs to the prediction of vessel motion induced VIVs, making the prediction possible. Also, the effects of Re numbers and surface roughness on hydrodynamics of VIV and the effect of wake interference on hydrodynamics of a twin-tube submerged floating tunnel (SFT) can be found for can efficient way and requirement in the literature. In chapter 5, based on the challenges remaining in the problem of wave-in-deck impact on offshore structures discussed above, there are several research gaps that can be addressed in future. There is still considerable uncertainty about the magnitude and distribution of wave impact loads on structural deck elements near the free-surface. Effects of the columns of the floating platform on the wave-in-deck forces have not been systematically studied. The measurement, estimation and simulation of local pressures due to wave-in-deck impact events on all types of offshore structures remains challenging. Accurate measurements and prediction of global loads and dynamic response of floating offshore structures due to wave-in-deck impact events is extremely limited. Combined numerical-experimental wave-in-deck investigations on floating offshore structures are not currently available in the open literature. In chapter 6, this chapter focused on hybrid model testing (HMT) combines physical model test and numerical simulations to solve problems that physical model tests alone cannot conveniently or reliably address. In marine model testing, the challenges like ultra-deep water, multi-phase fluids, parameter traversal and so on cannot be avoided. HMT is regarded as the most promising technique to solve these issues. As of today, HMT is still immature, some advanced applications however have been developed. HMT allows researchers to impose mass-spring-damping parameters in virtual space and can artificially adjust and precisely control these critical parameters. It is a very helpful and exciting idea to solve the involved problems. In Chapter 7, a brief reviewed of friction test in terms of two main areas exist where friction is of importance: machineries and mechanical connections, and in cargo/mechanical handling operations. For maritime and offshore applications (e.g. Out-of-Plane Bending), surface conditions and environmental conditions are important parameters. Small and the smaller specimens may be used for screening the theoretical friction coefficients and find trends. Larger or even real size specimens should be used to confirm the actual behaviour. As per the results of literature, friction tests can be split it eh standard, small size specimen standard tests, and the large size, more representative tests. While the standard tests are well covered by standards and guidelines, the larger set-ups are to be tailor made and require goo understanding of the physics as results require interpretation by the experimenter. In chapter 8, the measurement, analysis and mitigation of vibrations in ship and offshore structures is rather well established. Nevertheless, measurement and mitigation methods are still being developed. Measurement’s techniques may also include laser of video techniques. Mitigation measures include devices that cancel vibrations at a low weight penalty, such as absorbing supports or Tuned Mass Dampers. Numerical developments include methods that use sub-structuring or modal shapes to reduce the computational cost. In chapter 9, Material selection for ships and offshore structures exposed to sub-zero temperatures is traditionally based on Charpy and fracture toughness test results of the base materials and its welded connections. In the last years however, fatigue properties have been the focus of a couple of studies due to the acceleration of fatigue crack growth below the so-called fatigue transition temperature, where ductile crack growth is superimposed by cleavage burst. Concluding, fatigue testing at low temperatures demands special attention to the set-up and instrumentation. The testing temperature is normally lower than the application temperature, and liquid nitrogen may be needed to cool down the area of interest to -60 °C. Temperature compensation is required for sensor, either strain gauges or potential drop methods. In chapter 10, The corrosion process and the interpretation of the effect of corrosion on the structural integrity remains an area of uncertainty. In corrosion testing, a large spread may be observed in measured corrosion rates, as is confirmed by industrial thickness measurement. Including the geometrical effects of corrosion damage in a representative manner in numerical simulations requires the use of probabilistic methods, as a precise description would require model with too many details. Hence, simplifications and generalizations are needed. In chapter 11, large scale impact experimentation are unique options to verify developments in structures design, analysis and prediction of failure. In turn, this demands good command of the experimentation techniques, and the use of as many sensors as possible to make possible use of the results. In chapter 12, The chapter present a State-of-the-Art review, to include recent advances and future trends of industry challenge with current standard and out lookout. The wind industry is concerning with the long time-to-marked for future large turbine blades and are interested in ways to shorten the test time. It is a question at which size and when will it stop to make sense to test these long blades according to current standard. Trends of development of more advanced test methods investigated a dual or multi axis test methods to test blades under more representative loading compared to operational loads and ways to speed up the test and challenge with different SN-curves for different materials. Testing parts of blades captured testing with more complex and realistic loading at forced loading, challenges with boundaries, and using subcomponent testing to validate numerical models. In chapter 13, Full scale ice load measurements play a significant role in the design of ships and offshore structures in ice covered waters. Full scale measurements of fixed vertical offshore structure are dis-cussed here. Generalizability of the results can be summarised that as pointed out by Kärnä (2009) it is likely that the experimental data recorded on vertical structures is only applicable for the conditions where the data was record-ed. Thus, data recorded for stiff structures might not be applicable for compliant structures. As discussed before, the compliancy might be one source of the observed rate dependency. The collected data is often incomplete: although local and global ice forces can be recorded during ice action, the ice properties (compressive strength, porosity...) might remain unknown. It is because the ice samples cannot be taken during ice action - when ice is moving. Actual local pressure is challenging to measure. It is known that the ice pressure is concentrated in a small area as shown by Joensuu & Riska (1989). They observed in laboratory scale experiments using PVDF-film that the ice pressure is concentrated on narrow, line like high pressure zones. But, the area of the load panels in full scale of often quite big, in the order of 1 m2. Thus, the actual local pressure exerted to structure is significantly higher than the average pressure measured with the big load panels. But there is no method available for more accurate local pressure measurements in full scale. Although field tests are important and can reveal phenomena that cannot be observed in laboratory scale, there are few things to consider when interpreting the results. In chapter 14, Bridging the relationship between the degradation in the material and the structure is an emerging field of research which requires advanced data fusion, signal processing, AI-based trend detection algorithms and the reliability analysis methods. Data fusion herein refers to combining the data gathered from different SHM sensors by using data fusion algorithms for better damage diagnosis (Eleftheroglou et al., 2018). Other research efforts are recommended for improving the durability of SHM sensors for offshore implementations, inclusion of SHM in the condition monitoring standards and guidelines, addressing big-data issues for developing real-time data collection and analysis frameworks and using the digital twins for real-time reliability assessment. In the Benchmark study, from this relatively simple experiment performed by 6 parties, it is clear that a vast range of choices can be made to carry out the tests. Understanding the effect of the choices on the end result is essential. For instance, a heavy sensor influences the natural frequency a lot. Also, the chosen instrumentation influences the information to be gained from an experiment. Only the natural frequency, by manual excitation, or also damping and higher order modes when using an instrumented hammer. In order to understand the many experiments that are done worldwide, sharing of the results and being transparent on the methodologies of experimentation is very beneficial for making the most of any experiment. Experimental data should be published as is in digital format and not only as a by-product in a publication as figures limiting the use of it.",

      "abstract": "Hull weight is a design parameter affecting the whole performances of a ship, being related to building costs, operational costs, maintenance and durability, and not least to satisfaction of functional requirements. Naval ships are no exception and impact of hull weight is crucial to fulfil mission requirements. In the light of the above, weight reduction is one of the main design drivers and it should be duly accounted for since the concept design phase. In this paper, a design approach intended for pre-contractual design phases is presented. It takes advantage of recent developments and trends of construction rules as well as of nowadays-available computation potential to update and improve the traditional scantling design approach, applied since decades by designers. The complexity and computational burden is kept to a minimum to provide a user-friendly procedure applicable in everyday working practice. Designers’ experience and judgment continue to drive the whole process. A Visual Basic support software has been developed with worksheet interfaces to implement the proposed scantling design procedure. Test cases showed significant weight reductions with respect to as-built ships and to scantling obtained by applying traditional design procedures.",

      "abstract": "Monopile foundations contain welding residual stresses and are widely used in industry to support offshore wind turbines (OWTs). The monopiles are subjected to hammering loads during installation and cyclic loads during operation, therefore the influence of residual stress redistribution as a result of fatigue cycles must be evaluated in these structures. The existing empirical models to predict the residual stress redistribution in the presence of cyclic loading conditions are strongly dependent on the material, welding process and loading conditions. Hence, there is a need to predict the residual stress redistribution using finite element simulations. In this study numerical analyses have been conducted to predict the initial state of residual stress in a simplified weld geometry and examine the influence of subsequent cyclic loads on the relaxation behavior in residual stress profiles. The results have shown that fatigue cycles have a severe effect on residual stress relaxation with the greatest reduction in residual stress values observed in the first cycle. Moreover, the numerical prediction results have shown that the stress amplitude plays a key role in the extent of residual stress relaxation in welded structures.",

      "abstract": "Although in the last decades the applicable regulations for the design of steel structures have been deeply improved accounting for modern design approaches and technologies, in a few industrial fields, concepts and formulations derived from centuries-old experience are even nowadays the governing rule. This very often limits the potential offered by the technological innovations in high-performance material, such as quenched and tempered (QT) steels. After having verified in the scientific literature, in the commercial one and in several open material databases that some main data necessary to the comprehensive characterization of QT steel used in building large metal structures are lacking, an extensive experimental campaign was undertaken to achieve an updated and specific fatigue strength characterization for certain types of materials. The aim is to overcome the strict requirements of current regulations on the application of both parent QT materials and welded homogeneous and heterogeneous joints between different steel strength. The experimental campaign allowed filling the knowledge gap as well as providing further understanding whether the use of high-strength steel is effective in the improvement of performances of large steel structures, whose fabrication procedures are typical of building sites rather than workshops. Their extensive application in current building practice is expected to be highly beneficial in terms of weight and costs.",

      "abstract": "Merchant vessels experience regular structural assessments. Traditionally, surveys are performed physically by surveyors being expansive and time-consuming. Imagery based, cracks recognition is a topic obtaining considerable interest in commercial and scientific sectors. By using computer vision algorithms, authors propose a new approach to expedite crack detection, visualize the cracks efficiently in ship structures and then measure their length. The process includes two parts: at first, crack images are captured manually by using low-cost handheld cameras. Afterward, image is imported into software and processed. To make analysis easier, image is compressed and converted into grayscale. Image contrast is then stretched to enhance the contrast between background and crack. After obtaining latent crack identification features, images are elaborated by pre-processing, feature extraction, image segmentation, thus estimating the region of interest and determining whether the image includes a crack or not. Based on experiments and comparing results to traditional naked-eyes approaches, the algorithm is found efficient in crack detection, hence reducing cost and making crack identification system more portable, accurate and integrated.",

Traditionally, structural integrity assessment is performed by surveyors, requiring complex and time-consuming operations to accessany ship space. Imagery based, three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of structures is a new area obtaining considerable interest. It can provide low-cost, less disruptive and safer inspection approach. In this study, alternative technologies to generate 3D models, based on photos, are explored. The aim is to highlight how human made ship survey can be improved using robotics technology. A procedure for 3D reconstruction combining photogrammetry/videogrammetry and computer vision techniques is developed, providing an alternative to ease vessel inspections. Moreover, effect of pre-processing image datasets, aimed at improving the performance of 3D reconstruction, is investigated. An efficient image pre-processing pipeline based on computer vision algorithms for colour enhancement, shadow removal and image blurriness is presented. This study can help in effective and reliable decision-making process, due to its user-friendliness and cost effectiveness, mainly for cargo holds requiring frequent assessment because of cargo operations induced damages.",

To face the problem of numerical modelling, an overview on Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) numerical computational is provided, introducing the main parameters to care about while modelling the interaction of a hydro-foil with the flow. The software capabilities are explored, reporting the main steps to follow, in order to build both solid and fluid models of a hydrofoil, and to couple them in a FSI analysis.

      "abstract": "To further exploit the potential of marine composites applications in building ship hulls, offshore structures, and marine equipment and components, design approaches should be improved, facing the challenge of a more comprehensive and explicit assessment of appropriately defined limit states. The structure ultimate/limit conditions shall be verified in principle within the whole structural domain and throughout the ship service life. What above calls for extended and reliable materials characterization on the one hand and for accurate and wide-ranging procedures in structural analyses. This paper presents an overview of recent industrial developments of marine composites limit states assessments and design approaches, as available in open literature, focusing on pleasure crafts and yachts as well as navy ships and thus showing a starting point to fill the gap in this respect. After a general introduction about composites characterization techniques, current design practice and rule requirements are briefly summarized. Both inter-ply and intra-ply failure modes and corresponding limit states are then presented along with recently proposed assessment approaches. Three-dimensional aspects in failure modes and manufacturing methods have been identified as the main factors influencing marine composite robustness. Literature review highlighted also fire resistance and hybrid joining techniques as significant issues in the use of marine composites.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this study is to investigate the technical feasibility of an innovative vertical axis floating wind turbine concept with the main focus on the design and verification of the mooring system. The study is developed through iterative processes in order to identify the optimum design for the new floating wind turbine concept. The Ultimate Limit State (ULS) criteria have been considered to verify the integrity of the mooring system in the extreme environmental conditions with a 50-year return period. For this purpose, time domain dynamic analysis has been performed using the commercial software OrcaFlex [Orcina website, OrcaFlex software, https://www.orcina.com/]. Although the analysis is carried out for a specific site deemed suitable for the project, the results can be used as an input for any future application in other locations. The present study is intended to be a proof of concept with a proposed scientific framework for optimization of the mooring system which is considered to be a crucial part in the design of floating wind turbines due to their complex dynamic behavior.",

      "abstract": "This paper deals with the estimate of uncertainties affecting still water hull girder loads of bulk and dry cargo ships. In strength assessment of ships, two main categories of acting loads are considered: still water loads and wave induced ones. While the latter are generally defined bearing in mind their stochastic nature, this is not the case for still water loads, which are basically deterministically considered. The underlying assumption is that there is an overall control of the operational profile during the service of a ship. However, this is not the case in actual fact, especially for general dry cargo ships and bulk carriers, since the loading/unloading process cannot be fully controlled by the crew, often resulting into loading conditions rather different from those planned by the designer. Based on an earlier work, where loading conditions of the above-mentioned ship types were statistically analyzed, in the present paper Monte Carlo simulations are used to estimate the uncertainties affecting the hull girder still water loads of ships in service, showing that their allowable values can be exceeded due to inaccuracies in ship and cargo management.",

      "abstract": "Weight saving is crucial in naval architecture to reduce costs and improve performances. In sailing ships design, rig's scantling is important also for ship stability, as rig's weight generates heeling actions on the vessel, due to heeled navigation. Therefore, rig's weight saving remarkably reduces ship's heeling, allowing to increase the wind exposed area, consequently improving the sailing performances. However, because of the complexity of the structure and uncertainties in loading conditions, the structural scantling of a rig implies the adoption of high safety factors. Furthermore, the increasing trend to use composite materials represents an additional source of complexity due to their anisotropic non-homogeneous nature and uncertainties on material properties, and generally implies even larger safety factors, besides implying high construction costs. The present work shows a comparison between an existing 76 m carbon mast and an aluminium alloy one. Suitable FEM models of both rigs were built up and used to assess the structural system strength according to applicable class rules. The cross-section stiffness of the aluminium mast was optimized in order to make masts’ performances comparable. The optimized aluminium mast, of comparable weight of the carbon one, results to be more cost-effective for such range of sailing vessels.",

      "abstract": "Dock tuning is a crucial stage in the rig service life and in the sailing management. Such operation is necessary for safety and structural stability reasons. The applied pretension has the purpose to increase the stiffness of the whole rig, reducing large displacements caused by aerodynamic and inertial loads. Furthermore, since the rig is aimed at supporting sails, its deformation significantly affects aerodynamic performances, so that dock tuning has also a relevant impact on the propulsion, especially in racing. However, the complexity of the problem and the peculiarities of each different system are the causes of the lack of specific dock tuning procedures in rules and guidelines of Classification societies. The present work, developed in collaboration with the Italian shipyard Perini Navi S.p.A., consists in the validation of a dock tuning numerical procedure adopting a Finite Element Method (FEM) applied to a 67 m long mast. A detailed comparison with real-scale experimental results has been carried out, highlighting the importance of a reliable modelling to accurately predict the non-linear behaviour of the structure. Technical guidelines for dock tuning simulation of large rigs are also provided for the first time in open literature, to the best of the authors’ knowledge.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, many disasters due to earthquakes and tsunamis occurred in various countries, including Japan. Two triple junctions exist below the Japanese archipelago and around Japan, where three plates meet to form a complicated crustal structure. To conduct research on the Tohoku earthquake, which accompanied the tsunami that devastated northern Japan in March 2011, Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) constructed the scientific deep-sea drilling vessel Chikyu. To understand the mechanism of the earthquakes, a direct access to the fault zone is necessary. During drilling operations, the drill pipes are stressed by different forces and the occurrence of drill-string failures is high, which causes significant loss of money and time. This study focused on the definition of a practical fatigue assessment procedure useful to avoid failures during drilling operations. In this paper the proposed procedure is outlined, and the sensitivity analysis carried out to highlight most influencing parameters is presented.",

      "abstract": "Composite materials are becoming more and more popular, even for large ship and offshore structures. In case of slender structures, where buckling is the governing limit state, such features are valuable and allow designing high performance assemblies like racing crafts as well as very large sail ships. The case of composite masts of sail ships is rather interesting, being a relatively large, stiff but light structure whose reliability is crucial for ship safety. Indeed, such case is also the paradigm of the dynamic buckling behaviour of slender columns structures, pointing out differences between the widely used quasi-static design approach and the more realistic time domain simulations. An earlier work studied the dynamic buckling behaviour of a metallic mast. Now, the study has been extended to the much more complex case of composite masts, showing some variations due to anisotropic material properties and specific weight values different by an order of magnitude.",

      "abstract": "This paper describes the large-scale testing and the finite element simulations of the collapse of a steel-composite joint, both bolted and bonded. The joined structures are typical ones of shipbuilding and namely of naval ships. Composite superstructures, beside a valuable weight reduction, may improve the signature features of the ship by embedding installed electronic devices into a composite mast. In the frame of a broader research project, including the electromagnetic characterization of the composite structures, also the structural design and its optimization were exploited, embracing, among other issues, the joining solutions between the steel deck structures to the composite ones of the superstructure side shell. A large-scale specimen of the joint was conceived and collapse tested while, in parallel, design simulations were carried out at different levels of detail. Eventually, a complete description of the collapse of the joint, including the nonlinear simulation by finite element analysis of the progressive failure of the composite laminates of the side shell was obtained and test results were used to validate the numerical models. Depending on the design stage, various scantling procedures, from a very simplified one to a rather complex and time-consuming numerical analysis, can now be applied to verify the structural behavior of these steel to composite joints as well as to select the most cost-effective solution among several options.",

      "abstract": "A Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) conventional case study is proposed to be used as a benchmark for numerical analyses. Experimental tests were carried out to provide targets for comparisons; in particular, the study regarded the estimate of the deformed configuration (“flying shape” in the sailing field) of a square sail under a uniform flow regime in a wind tunnel facility. Several tests have been carried out at different wind velocities. The sailcloth has been characterized by means of mono-axial tensile tests obtaining Young's and shear moduli as well as Poisson's coefficients, which have then been used as input parameters for numerical analyses. Test results are considered a benchmark target deserving challenging aspects for numerical simulations in spite of the selected simple test geometry and conditions. Numerical tests have been carried out by means of a commercial software (ADINA™). Analyses used a strongly coupled partitioned approach between a Finite Volume Method (FVM) based on Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) equations, whereas a Finite Element Method (FEM) has been adopted for the structural field. A comparison has been eventually carried out assessing different numerical models. A good overall agreement between experimental and numerical results has been obtained by suitably setting FSI simulation algorithms.",

      "abstract": "This paper deals with the fatigue assessment of three ship structural details. While local approaches, which are proposed in relevant literature and which nowadays are also widely applied in design practice, can successfully assess the fatigue strength of several welded joints, web-stiffened complex geometries show peculiar features, needing to bias the results of local approaches. Hence, even recent rule requirements need to include correction factors to account for such deviations. The present study identifies effects, which alter particularly the crack propagation behaviour. Some test cases were re-evaluated using approaches referring to the effective notch stress and to the strain energy density. Results are compared with the test results in order to provide explanations to the above-mentioned biased assessments.",

      "abstract": "Despite several potential advantages, relatively few studies and design support tools have been developed for floating vertical axis wind turbines. Due to the substantial aerodynamics differences, the analyses of vertical axis wind turbine on floating structures cannot be easily extended from what have been already done for horizontal axis wind turbines. Therefore, the main aim of the present work is to compare the dynamic response of the floating offshore wind turbine system adopting two different mooring dynamics approaches. Two versions of the in-house aero-hydro-mooring coupled model of dynamics for floating vertical axis wind turbine (FloVAWT) have been used, employing a mooring quasi-static model, which solves the equations using an energetic approach, and a modified version of floating vertical axis wind turbine, which instead couples with the lumped mass mooring line model MoorDyn. The results, in terms of mooring line tension, fatigue and response in frequency have been obtained and analysed, based on a 5 MW Darrieus type rotor supported by the OC4-DeepCwind semisubmersible.",

      "abstract": "The anti-ballistic properties of a new advanced composite armor system have been investigated with the aim to minimize the armor system total weight per unit area. The innovative protection, made of a silicon carbide ceramic outer layer and an inner composite back-packing layer formed by ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) fibers, namely Dyneema <sup>®</sup> Hard Ballistic 26, was realized and then tested performing dedicated ballistic impact tests. In order to investigate its permanent deformation, ceramic cracking, dimension of the rupture, and extension of the impact damage, nondestructive and destructive tests were conducted on the tested panels. The experimental results were used to develop and validate a transient nonlinear dynamic simulation model of the high-velocity impact of a 7.62 AP bullet on the tested armor system. After an accurate setting of the parameters involved in the description of the material constitutive models and of the involved physical phenomena, a complex numerical model was developed in the ANSYS-Autodyn <sup>®</sup> environment using both mesh and meshless approaches at the same time. The comparison reveals a good agreement between experimental and computational results in terms of ballistic properties, deformations, fragmentation, and fracture of the ballistic armor system. Hence, a new numerical model for the design and the optimization of the ballistic efficiency of composite armor systems was developed and can be now used in current practice.",

      "abstract": "This paper deals with the buckling assessment of stiffened panels, typical of ship and offshore structures. In particular, rather slender structures, involving very thin plates and stiffeners with limited cross section, are considered. In order to limit the computational burden of a fully nonlinear progressive collapse analysis but, at the same time, to retain some benefits of a numerical finite element model assessment, an improved linearized buckling procedure is proposed in this work. The idea is to linearize the computation in a suitable point based on the design load of the structure, so that the results of a linearized buckling analysis are more informative in practice. Results are assessed with nonlinear collapse analyses, comprehensively considering various loading cases. Eventually, a hands-on buckling assessment procedure is suggested, which can be implemented in rules and design process if adequately validated by a suitable number of test cases and, possibly, experimental data.",

(2001) in two dimensions and later studied in three dimensions by Valdés Vazquez (2007), Lombardi (2012), and Trimarchi (2012). We focus on a 3D test case in which we evaluated the sensitivity of several input parameters on the fluid and structural results. In particular, this analysis provides a starting point from which we can look deeper into specific aspects of these simulations and analyze more realistic cases, e.g., in sails design. In this study, using the commercial software ADINA<sup>™</sup>, we addressed a well-known unsteadiness problem comprising a square box representing the fluid domain with a flexible bottom modeled with structural shell elements. We compared data from previously published work whose authors used the same numerical approach, i.e., a partitioned approach coupling a finite volume solver (for the fluid domain) and a finite element solver (for the solid domain). Specifically, we established several benchmarks and made comparisons with respect to fluid and solid meshes, structural element types, and structural damping, as well as solution algorithms. Moreover, we compared our method with a monolithic finite element solution method. Our comparisons of new and old results provide an outline of best practices for such simulations.",

      "abstract": "This paper reports a study on the uncertainties in assessing loading conditions of handy size bulk carriers. Loading conditions and the corresponding hull girder still-water loads are important for the safety of bulk carriers. Unfortunately, statistical studies on this topic remain very few, partly because of the difficulty in fully understanding the impact of loading/unloading operation process and partly because of intrinsic uncertainties in measuring cargo loading conditions data. Three handy-size bulk carriers were investigated and their actual loading conditions, spanning several voyages in 22 months, were collected. Statistical analyses of the collected data resulted in an estimate of the uncertainties in the loading/unloading process. Based on these analyses, probability distribution models for weights in cargo holds, water ballast tanks, fuel tanks as well as consumable tanks are proposed best fitting the collected data; hull girder still water loads statistical distributions are also obtained. It is expected that these analytical models can be used in structural reliability analyses that require the definition of uncertainties of loading conditions and of resulting still water loads.",

      "abstract": "The paper describes the large-scale collapse test and its relative structural verification of an adhesive bonded and bolted joint between a bridge deck's hull structure, complete with plating and reinforcements, and the bulkhead made of sandwich composites, reinforced by a structural member. The hull structures are typical of shipbuilding and in particular of a military ship. The composite structure is quite complex and includes both fiberglass sandwiches and reinforced carbon fiber laminates for the structural member. Composite superstructures, in addition to significant weight decreases, also allow to improve the electromagnetic signature features of the ship by installing electronic devices within an integrated shaft constructed of appropriate composite materials. Various calculations have been performed to simulate the evidence, with complexity and detail level gradually increasing, up to a complete numerical model that also includes nonlinear effects in progressive collapse. Experimental results can be used to validate calculation models and evaluate their effectiveness in relation to purposes.",

      "abstract": "The complexity of a rigging system is due to loads in compression, bending and torsion transmitted from stays, shrouds and sails to the mast as well as to its slenderness and nonlinearities. Buckling is by far the governing limit state, although additional phenomena may occur simultaneously such as excessive displacement/strain and yielding. In thin walled structures, like mast panels, also local collapse must be checked and finite element analysis of a 2D shell, rather than 1D beam, modeled mast panel is necessary to capture local buckling and related phenomena of such type of structures. Aiming at simplified numerical models, applicable in preliminary design and for optimization purposes, this paper investigates the possibility to create a 1D-beam model based on moment-curvature relations at different load conditions able to assess not only global limit states but also local ones.",

Indeed, for existing platforms, it is permissible to have limited individual component failures, provided the reserve strength against overall system failure remains acceptable. This system was used to determine the life expectancy of a platform used in the Gulf of Mexico for ten years, which was to be accordingly modified and installed on a new site off Congo. The analysis showed that a service life of ten years was feasible without need for strengthening.

      "abstract": "The interest in floating offshore wind turbines (FOWT) has been growing substantially over the last decade and, after a number of prototypes deployed [1], the first offshore floating wind farms have been approved and are being developed. While a number of international research activities have been conducted on the dynamics of offshore floating HAWT systems (e.g. OC3-Phase IV2, OC4-Phase II3), relatively few studies have been conducted on floating VAWT systems, despite their potential advantages [2]. Due to the substantial differences between HAWT and VAWT aerodynamics, the analyses on floating HAWT cannot be extended to floating VAWT systems. The main aim of the present work is to compare the dynamic response of the FOWT system adopting two different mooring dynamics approaches. Two version of the in-house aero-hydromooring coupled model of dynamics for VAWT \"FloVAWT\" [3] are used: one which adopts a mooring quasi-static model, and solves the equations using an energetic approach [4], and a modified version of FloVAWT, which uses instead the lumpedmass mooring line model \"MoorDyn\" [5]. The floating VAWT system considered is based on a 5MW Darrieus type rotor supported by the OC4-Phase II<sup>3</sup> semi-submersible. The results for the considered metocean conditions show that MoorDyn approach estimate larger translational displacements of the platform, compared to the quasi-static rigid approach previously implemented in FloVAWT. As expected, the magnitudes of the forces along the lines are lower, being part of the energy employed for the elastic deformation of the cables. A systematic comparison of the differences between the two approaches is presented.",

      "abstract": "Among recently introduced fatigue assessment approaches, the ones based on the notch stress intensity factor (N-SIF) concept appear to be very promising, both because of their theoretically soundness and because of the possibility of straightforward computation of parameters believed to govern the fatigue process. Actually, while such approaches can be considered in between stress-based approaches and crack propagation ones, quantities like N-SIF and strain energy density in a control volume can be evaluated by finite element analysis according to nowadays well-established procedures, mostly already implemented in commercial FEM software. The present study moves from a former one, dealing with butt joints between typical shipbuilding shell plates, and aims at assessing how the misalignment influences the fatigue strength estimation when applying the strain energy density approach. Eventually, the capabilities of such approach in accounting for misalignments is demonstrated and results are found in agreement with magnification factors currently recommended by guidelines and rules when applying other, stress based, fatigue assessment approaches.",

      "abstract": "The weld toe as well as the weld root of joints acts as a geometrical notch, which decreases the fatigue strength of welded components. Local approaches used for fatigue assessment account for the local stress concentration when referring to the notch stress as a fatigue parameter. This applies also to the approaches based on the notch stress intensity factor like, for example, the averaged strain energy density, neglecting the actual notch radius and considering a sharp notch as a simplification. A uniform S-N curve valid for different types of welded joints and failure locations was derived from re-analyses of fatigue test results as documented in literature. The fatigue tests described in this paper aimed at validating that energy-based S-N curve by dedicated tests on artificially notched specimens. At first, four parameters were investigated in order to estimate their influence on the fatigue strength and to select appropriate notch geometries for the final step of the test campaign. The advantages of these tests are that both the exact notch geometry and the local stress range at the notch, including misalignment effects, were identified and considered in experimental data analysis. This paper presents the results of the rather comprehensive testing activities and comparisons with the design-S-N curve mentioned, yielding unexpected fatigue behaviour. This can be explained by the short crack propagation life.",

      "abstract": "This paper aims at providing recommendations for the practical application of relatively novel fatigue assessment approaches. Although the concept of notch stress intensity factor (N-SIF) itself was proposed decades ago to provide the analytical solution of the stress field in way of sharp notches, only recently it has been considered as the basis for fatigue strength assessment of welded joints. N-SIF itself and derived quantities such as the equivalent peak stress or the averaged strain energy density (SED) can be assumed as fatigue governing parameters and applied in everyday engineering practice being supported by powerful computation facilities. The N-SIF approach is still too cumbersome for practical applications; the SED approach seems promising to overcome shortcomings, to be applied flexibly to different joint geometries and possibly to automate the calculation procedure in finite element analysis. Software having different features and different refinement strategies are applied in order to benchmark advantages and disadvantages of possible practical solutions for the approaches based on N-SIF and averaged SED, thus offering various element types and modelling strategies. In general, high computational accuracy has been verified, despite relatively coarse meshes, if the element type, shape and mesh pattern is selected properly. However, the approach based on the averaged SED can be unsuitable for studying the notch effect of varying geometries if the averaging area increases more than the local stress concentration rises, as shown for the simplified geometry of a butt joint.",

      "abstract": "Traditionally, propeller design has been focused on all activities necessary to obtain a propeller featuring a high efficiency, avoiding erosive cavitation for given operating conditions and having adequate structural strength. In recent years, more and more challenging requirements have been imposed, such as the reduction of radiated noise and pressures pulses, requiring more precise analyses and methods in the optimization of the propeller performance. On the other hand, the evaluation of the propeller strength still relies on simplified methods, which basically consider the blade as a cantilever beam subjected to characteristic static forces. Since the loads acting on a blade are variable in the blade revolution and in different operating conditions throughout the ship life, a procedure to account for the influence of fatigue phenomena is proposed. The fatigue assessment could reduce the safety factor in the propeller scantling rules and allow improving the quality of propeller design (e.g. obtaining higher efficiency, margin on cavitation phenomena, less noise).",

      "abstract": "During the fabrication of two different structures (a ship and a bridge), made by mild construction steel, some unacceptable anomalies were detected; the structures were almost completely fabricated and a repair of the defected structural details was impractical due to the extent of the defected zones. A fitness-for-service assessment has therefore been carried out, in both cases, by performing fatigue tests on representative samples, cut off from the structure and by evaluating the fatigue resistance curve. A re-assessment of the structural details in question was undertaken, on the basis of the experimental S-N curve, evaluating the fitness for service of the “defected details”. The experimental tests showed that the detected anomalies had no influence on the fatigue strength of the welded joints and that the examined details (a butt joint and a cruciform joint) behave in accordance with the relevant FAT classes. The experimental program has also given the opportunity to compare different methodologies for fatigue assessment: the Effective Notch Stress Method, the Fracture Mechanics Method and the Peak Stress Method. The different procedures have been applied to the tested specimens, and the expected fatigue life was compared with the experimental one.",

      "abstract": "The proper characterization of cast materials is rather challenging because of wide deviations of material features due to the fabrication process. In the frame of propeller design, a recently proposed fatigue assessment procedure highlighted the need of reliable fatigue strength characterization of cast bronzes. With the aim of obtaining reference S–N curves to support the fatigue assessment of propeller blades and to evaluate the effect on fatigue strength of the most influencing parameters, a comprehensive literature survey was carried out. It appeared that fatigue strength of cast bronzes is quite challenging to evaluate, firstly, because the properties may considerably differ from small specimens to real blades and, secondly, because relatively few experimental data are openly available.",

In this paper, the effect of shear stress distribution on the structural components of the hull girder is analyzed. At first, finite element (FE) models simulating a suitable length of the hull girder are considered. Later, smaller models of stiffened panels are extracted from the hull girder models and analyzed. The aim of this work is to investigate the shear stress distribution originating in the entire cross section and to build a smaller model extracted from a selected portion of the ship where hull girder collapse is supposed to initiate.",

      "abstract": "Several approaches exist for the fatigue strength assessment of welded joints. In addition to the traditional nominal stress approach, various approaches were developed using a local stress as fatigue parameter. In recent times, the N-SIF based approaches using the notch stress intensity at the weld toe or root have been developed. Based on this, the more practical strain energy density (SED) and the Peak Stress approaches were proposed. This paper reviews the proposed design S-N curves of the N-SIF and SED approaches questioning in particular the consideration of misalignment effects, which should be included on the load side of local approaches in order to consider them individually in different types of welded joints. A re-analysis of fatigue tests evaluated for the effective notch stress approach leads to slight changes of the design S-N curves and of the radius of the control volume used for averaging the SED at the notches. Further, on purpose fatigue tests of artificially notched specimens show that the fatigue assessment using a single-point fatigue parameter might be problematic because the crack propagation phase, being part of the fatigue life, is strongly affected by the stress distribution along the crack path that may vary considerably between different geometries and loading cases.",

      "abstract": "In this work, the possible exploitation of fiber-reinforced composites in the context of maritime transportation of compressed natural gas (CNG) is investigated. In addition to a more conventional steel configuration, two different fiber materials, carbon and glass, are considered as construction materials for pressure vessels (PVs) to be stored on board ships, with thickness optimized by FEM analysis.The considered scenario is represented by the transportation of CNG from an offshore well to a terminal on shore. Fleets of ships carrying CNG in pressure vessels manufactured with the investigated materials are generated by means of a ship synthesis model (SSM) software and compared on the basis of technical and economical indicators.The choice of the construction material influences considerably the weight of the PVs, which represent a major item of total ship weight and reflects directly on the general transport performances in terms of resistance, seakeeping and reliability in the service. On the other hand, capital as well as operating expenditures are considerably affected by the choice. When exploring the design space, the ship synthesis model is able, at a preliminary stage of the design, to account for the various technical and economical aspects, their implications and relationships. Results are presented of computations carried out in a specific case, identified by the annual gas production and other characteristics of the well terminal and a cruising route for the ships. The comparison is carried out on the basis of the cost per transported unit of gas and of the percentage of success in the transportation process. The computations show that the choice of the PV material has a key influence on the results in terms of optimal number, dimensions and speed of the ships.",

The final aim was to assess their structural behaviour as well as their interactions and effects onto the shell plating. Fillers may be considered as two-components particulate composites characterized by type size and content of microspheres randomly embedded in a resin matrix. Hull and superstructure of yachts are covered by filler to obtain smooth surfaces necessary for faired and painted shiny exteriors. Simple tests were designed and carried out on several commercially available fillers: compression tests on isolated filler specimens and three point bending tests on specimens made by filler applied onto a steel substrate were considered sufficient to obtain an isotropic constitutive model characterization. Numerical models were thereafter built up to highlight some specific effects of the structural behaviour of plated structures coated by fillers.",

      "abstract": "Ultimate strength of the hull girder of containerships became a significant issue in the last years in view of recent accidents and related investigations. Actually, larger and larger ships were put into service and still are designed and built. Recognizing such an issue, investigations were carried out and led to the issuance of a specific longitudinal strength standard for containerships by the International Association of Classification Societies [1]. Loading conditions become more and more challenging and especially combinations of various actions were found to impair the hull girder ultimate strength. In the attempt to better understand the influence of load combinations onto the ultimate strength of the hull girder, investigations were carried out. In this paper, the effects of the shear is considered using rather refined and accurate finite element models of a typical containership double bottom.",

      "abstract": "The main aim of this work is the fatigue strength assessment of a butt joint with weld reinforcement, typically used in steel works and especially in shipbuilding applications when varying different geometric parameters of the welded joint; to this purpose, three different approaches for fatigue strength estimates were applied, i.e. the Effective Notch Stress Approach, which is now commonly used and it is supported by a comprehensive bibliography, the Strain Energy Density approach (SED) and the Peak Stress Method (PSM), the latter ones newly introduced in scientific literature and still being tested within industrial practice. Furthermore, all analyses were carried out using two different finite element codes: ANSYS<sup>®</sup> and ADINA<sup>®</sup>. The application of different FEM software allowed verifying the quality of obtained results, disclosing certain essential aspects related to the extrapolation of values from integration points of finite elements and extending the Peak Stress Method to an additional software with respect to that proposed by the author of the method, i.e. ANSYS<sup>®</sup>.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to study the concept of shear lag effective breadth of plating, widely applied in the scantling assessments of metallic ship structures, for the special case of composite hull stiffened plating. Indeed, geometries and material behaviour are rather different and the definition of the effective breadth is worthy of investigation. A broad literature survey highlighted that the case of composites is almost not covered by previous studies and that only simplified empirical formulations are proposed for effective breadth evaluations in the rules of classification societies. Thus, suitable finite element models were created and validated to investigate the behaviour of the effective breadth of stiffened laminates when varying geometrical and other typical parameters of composite made ship structures. It was found useful to switch from stresses to strains in the effective breadth definition, considering the anisotropy of the material. An extensive sensitivity analysis allowed assessing the effect of parameters governing the phenomenon. Eventually, regression formulae are proposed summarising the outcomes and possibly applicable in design scantling practice.",

      "abstract": "The design of sail systems is a fascinating topic that naval architects have been facing since many centuries and nowadays is revived because of the increasing size of modern pleasure and racing yachts. It is hence surprising that empiricism largely drives mast and rigging design even at the present time. Actually, while structural dynamics is explicitly considered in current scantling design of hull structures, this is not usually the case for mast and rigging. However, numerical simulations can now be successfully applied to assess effects of load variations in time. Considering the governing limit states and the typical behaviour of a pre-tensioned slender structure, the dynamic buckling of the bottom panel of a typical large mast is evaluated in this paper, showing significant differences from the widely applied quasi-static approach. The obtained results provide a new perspective for the scantling assessment of sail systems, overcoming the current empirical and prescriptive approach proposed by rules of classification societies and international standards.",

      "abstract": "An innovative Wave Energy Converter (WEC) device was recently patented by Carter and Ertekin (2011). The device is composed of a submerged disk extending to the seabed trough a fixed structure of columns in shallow water or it may be a floating submerged structure moored to the ocean floor in deep-water applications. In the center of the disk, there is a circular opening, and below it a cylindrical tube is attached to the opening. Waves passing over the disk induce a bidirectional flow inside the tube. A turbine placed in the tube can convert the energy of this flow into mechanical energy that can be transformed into electrical energy. The inventors studied the performance of this device by numerical simulations and conducted experiments at a Froude-scaled model in a laboratory. In this paper, we first carry out numerical calculations of the flow predicting the power generated by a prototype model after maximizing velocities in the opening by varying the dimensions of the device. A preliminary design analysis for an hypothetical application of this device was made. In this phase, we were faced with a number of design issues for this kind of WEC. The result of this work is a general overview of a possible application of the patented device and it is aimed at defining the real performance of it.",

Different numerical simulations have been conducted in Autodyn™ environment in order to model the non-linear dynamics of interactions between a NATO 7.62 Armour Piercing bullet and a range of different target models. To analyze the fragmentation and fracture behavior of ceramic tiles, different numerical modeling strategies were used. Moreover, the best setting of numerical parameters involved in the description of the mathematical model have been obtained and validated. These numerical results have been compared to experimental tests: the comparison has been used to analyze, modify and finally validate the most cost effective modeling strategy and the main parameters involved in the dynamic simulation of High Velocity Impact (HVI) obtaining a finite element model that describe with good agreement the results of the experimental tests.",

      "abstract": "In previous works, the importance of considering fatigue phenomena has been analysed and a procedure for propeller blades fatigue assessment was outlined. The results obtained by applying the procedure allowed underlining the need of a more detailed and direct approach to propeller structural design, which could lead to different blade scantling limits. In the present work, further analyses are carried out comparing results obtained with direct calculations of fatigue effects and the requirements of some Classification Societies; in order to do this, the design of a propeller with two different shaft inclinations is considered as a test case. The analysis conducted in this work provides useful information for the propeller designer, allowing a deeper insight into the effect of propeller characteristics on its design and scantling.",

      "abstract": "An innovative Wave Energy Converter (WEC) device was recently patented by Carter and Ertekin (2011). The device is composed of a submerged disk extending to the seabed trough a fixed structure of columns in shallow water or it may be a floating submerged structure moored to the ocean floor in deep-water applications. In the center of the disk, there is a circular opening, and below it a cylindrical tube is attached to the opening. Waves passing over the disk induce a bidirectional flow inside the tube. A turbine placed in the tube can convert the energy of this flow into mechanical energy that can be transformed into electrical energy. The inventors studied the performance of this device by numerical simulations and conducted experiments at a Froude-scaled model in a laboratory. In this paper, we first carry out numerical calculations of the flow predicting the power generated by a prototype model after maximizing velocities in the opening by varying the dimensions of the device. A preliminary design analysis for an hypothetical application of this device was made. In this phase, we were faced with a number of design issues for this kind of WEC. The result of this work is a general overview of a possible application of the patented device and it is aimed at defining the real performance of it.",

      "abstract": "When considering the ultimate strength of hull girders, reference is usually made to pure vertical bending and collapse analysis is carried out by progressively increasing the curvature of the beam. However, reality is much more complex and combined loads may affect the collapse behavior of the structure. Building a complete FE numerical model able to simulate a ship's portion whose extension in length be sufficient to properly evaluate combined loading effects is rather time consuming, both in terms of modelling and of computational time. Moreover, when dealing with large models, assigning properly boundary conditions representing actual forces and moments distribution on the hull girder is a challenging task. In this paper the effect of shear stress distribution on the hull girder structural components is analyzed. At first, finite element models simulating a suitable length of the hull girder are considered. Later on, smaller models of stiffened panels are extracted from hull girder models and analyzed. Shear stress distributions due to both shear forces and torsion moments acting on the hull girder appear to influence the ultimate strength. The aim of this work is to investigate the shear stress distribution originating in the whole cross section and build a smaller model extracted from a selected portion of the ship where hull girder collapse is supposed to initiate. Proper boundary conditions and load application are investigated in order to match the stress distributions found in the global model.",

Fillers are two-components particulate composites, characterized by type, size and content of glass microsphere, randomly embedded in an epoxy matrix. Hull and superstructure of yachts are covered by filler to mould the surfaces. To obtain painted shiny surfaces, the filler should be perfectly levelled, faired and smoothed. Differently to the works presented in open literature, this paper focuses on the macro-mechanics properties regardless the fillers’ internal mechanic. Two types of tests were designed and conducted on six different fillers: a compression strength test on simple filler specimens and a three point bending test on specimens made by filler applied onto a steel substrate. Load- displacement curves of tested fillers were acquired providing the basis for the characterization of strength and stiffness. Results are repeatable and consistent and comparisons among different fillers are presented.",

The paper focuses on the fatigue assessment approaches based on the notch stress intensity factor, which assume that fatigue is governed by the singular stress field at notch tips. Two approaches, referring to either the local strain energy density or to the peak stress value, are presented and applied. Additionally, a sensitivity investigation regarding the geometry of the weld seam of butt joints was performed on the basis of strain energy density approach. Comparisons with test data and with assessments of other common approaches offer a critical review about where the pros and the limitations of each approach are.",

      "abstract": "The renewable energy targets set by the EU governments is pushing the wind industry toward deeper and further sites, making the floating option the preferred technical and economic choice. Certification authorities are developing new guidelines, recommended practices and standard specific for this industry, starting to recognize the importance, beside the operational phases, of the temporary phases such as sea transport and installation on site (DNV, 2013). The aim of the present work is to propose an approach to analyse the assembly and temporary phases, namely when the turbine is assembled on the floating support structure and the following transport phase from the shipyard to the operational site. After a review of the approaches for industries near to the offshore wind industry, a framework is proposed where criteria, standards and environmental and loading conditions are discussed. Taking the FOWT NOVA as a case study, the proposed framework is focused on semi-submersible FOWT, assessing the design of this floating support structure, highlighting the impact of these rules and evidencing an overall good performance. The proposed approach can be used as a starting point by administrations and certification authorities and as guidelines in the conceptual/preliminary design phases of the design of an FOWT structure. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",

Revised to read: “In general, the evaluated safety factors considering the previously mentioned operating profile range from about 5.5 to 6.5, for the 100% condition 2 range from about 4 to 5 and for the 100% max power range from about 3 to 4, independently from the type of stress considered.” (Table Presented) Text at the bottom of page 7, right column Considering the Mn bronze blade, instead, the loads of operating profile 4 result in the blade failure when the damage is evaluated with both the Peak and Rainflow methods and considering the first principal stress and with the Peak method considering the Von Mises stress. Revised to read: “Not even the damage evaluated for the blade in Mn bronze exceeds the unity, even if presenting a lower margin with respect to the Ni Al bronze blade.” (Table Presented) Text at the top of page 8, left column In Figure 14, representative of the condition 100% max power and Von Mises stress, it is clearly visible that some of the equivalent stress ranges Δσeq lie above the S-N curve and the corresponding safety factor s is indeed less than one.

      "abstract": "This paper deals with an experimental/numerical comparison of the interlaminar shear stress in typical marine composite laminates manufactured according to two different fabrication processes, namely vacuum infusion and pre-impregnated lay-up. Experimental tests were carried out at the Marine Structures Testing Lab of the University of Genova. Actually, among widely applied empirical formulations for the characterization of composites suggested by Classification Societies rules, the ones for the interlaminar shear strength appear the most scattered because of the complexity in assessing failure phenomena. Composite manufacturers generally carry out rather extensive tests for the complete characterization of the laminates.Due to non-linearities involved in the captioned study, the support of nonlinear numerical models was required. The aim of the comprehensive use of numerical approaches is the reduction of time-consuming and expensive experimental campaigns.Three different FE modeling strategies are proposed in order to verify the reliability of the numerical results in comparison with experimental targets. The merits and shortcomings of each are discussed, also comparing different types of finite element formulations and mesh refinement sensitivity. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",

While the tested specimens were originally intended for the assessment of buckling behavior of composite laminates of wind turbine blades, results were found valuable for the marine industry as well, because similar laminates are used for the hull shell and stiffeners. Systematic calculations were carried out to assess the effects of an embedded delamination on the buckling load, varying the size and through thickness position of the delamination. Different finite element modeling strategies were considered and validated against the experimental results.

      "abstract": "The Peak Stress Method (PSM) is a simplified, finite element-based technique to readily estimate the Notch Stress Intensity Factors (NSIFs) at the tip of sharp-V-shaped notches. More precisely, it was shown that the maximum principal stress evaluated at the V-notch tip by means of a rather coarse finite element analysis is proportional to the mode I NSIF, as far as mode II and mode III stresses are negligible. When fatigue strength assessment of fillet welded joints is performed according to the NSIF approach, the weld toe profile is modeled as a sharp V-notch having the toe radius equal to zero (the worst case hypothesis) and the peak stress can be used as design stress combined with a properly calibrated design scatter band. Due to its computational simplicity, the PSM appears rather useful for the everyday design practice of the shipbuilding industry. In the present paper the PSM is briefly described and applied to assess the fatigue strength of joints between HP stiffeners with fillet-welded cover plates adopted by the shipbuilding industry, for which full scale fatigue test data are available. By applying the PSM, good agreement between theoretical and experimental fatigue lives is obtained despite the complex geometry and the different loading conditions of the tests.",

Indeed, pleasure craft industry is now facing the challenge of thinner and thinner skin laminates. Buckling, that in past years was not a governing limit state because of rather high thicknesses and of limited spans of structural elements, should be now assessed possibly accounting for actual defects, i.e. delaminations, and applying straightforward but cost-effective approaches, easy to implement in the everyday practice of composite hull structural design.

      "abstract": "This paper deals with the fatigue strength assessment of attachments of bulb plate stiffeners (Holland profile), typical of ship structures, applying local approaches proposed by the International Institute of Welding (IIW) and in open literature. The application of these methods in the captioned cases is not always straightforward nor sometimes possible, neither effective. Difficulties in following the suggestions of IIW for the finite element (FE) modelling of relatively complex geometries are shown. Basically, the bulb itself is a three-dimensional component interacting with two-dimensional shells surrounding it: the three-dimensional versus two-dimensional mismatch is the main source of complexity. Since a reference thickness of the bulb cannot be identified, even the identification of stress points in post-processing of FE analyses is difficult, often being a cause of scatter and/or disagreement among different approaches. Comparisons among approaches and with available experimental data of tests carried out in the Ship Structures Laboratory of the University of Genova and in the Institute of Ship Structural Design and Analysis of the Hamburg University of Technology provide a general view of this topic and offer a critical review of the application of local approaches in rather challenging test cases, evaluating, as far as possible, effects of weld geometry on fatigue strength. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

      "abstract": "This paper deals with the mechanical behavior under in plane compressive loading of thick and mostly unidirectional glass fiber composite plates made with an initial embedded delamination. The delamination is rectangular in shape, causing the separation of the central part of the plate into two distinct sub-laminates. The work focuses on experimental validation of a finite element model built using the 9-noded MITC9 shell elements, which prevent locking effects and aiming to capture the highly non linear buckling features involved in the problem. The geometry has been numerically defined by a previously established modeling strategy (Branner et al., 2011; Gaiotti & Rizzo, 2011), using a pure shell model where the delamination is accounted for by properly offsetting its surfaces and connecting them to the intact plate via rigid link constraining algorithms. The numerical model developed by the University of Genova is compared with the experimental results provided by an extensive experimental campaign conducted by the Department of Wind Energy at the Technical University of Denmark (Branner & Berring, 2011). Along with the experimental/numerical comparison, an attempt to identify the fracture modes related to the production methods is presented in this paper. A microscopic analysis of the fracture surfaces was carried out in order to better understand the failure mechanisms. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group.",

      "abstract": "Current offshore structural design guidance, knowhow and standards are based on Oil & Gas industry research conducted mainly in the 1970s and 1980s. Since that time, European Steel Fabricators have made significant advances in volume manufacturing processes and these along with improvements in steel performance, Quality Assurance and advanced structural analysis techniques promise lower cost, reliable steel structures for use in Wind, Wave and Tidal power. In addition, there are several fundamental differences between conventional offshore Oil & Gas structures and those used in the emerging offshore renewable energy sector, not least; the very large volume of similar structures, the unmanned nature of installations and the cost margins involved. These combined with improved capabilities of modern offshore fabrication and design demand a fresh perspective on the Guidance and Standards available to developers.

      "abstract": "This paper deals with strength of composite sandwich panels typically used in pleasure boats and naval industry. The focus is on the influence of fabrication processes onto the mechanical behavior, namely onto buckling strength. Both, experimental and numerical analyses were carried out in the Ship Structures Laboratory of the University of Genova on rectangular specimens, whose dimensions and geometry were conceived to induce buckling collapse, being this one a typical failure mode under compressive loading for thin skins sandwich. Tests on both hand layup fabricated and infusion made panels were carried out measuring compressive load vs. shortening and lateral deflection. Videos of the tests were taken and used to gather some measurements and to assess failure time and location. Experimental results were compared with different numerical models, developed considering large deformations in the PVC core under buckling conditions. Various finite element types and different implementation were considered to model complex interactions between core and skins. The conclusions of this paper aim to provide designers of pleasure and naval crafts with some hints about different strategies to build up costeffective numerical models for predicting buckling and post-buckling behavior of sandwich hulls, taking advantage of calibrations obtained through experimental testing. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group, London, UK.",

      "abstract": "Ducted propellers, in decelerating duct configuration, may represent a possible solution for the designer to reduce cavitation and its side effects, that is, induced pressures and radiated noise; however, their design still presents challenges, due to the complex evaluation of the decelerating duct effects and to the limited amount of available experimental information. In the present paper, a hybrid design approach, adopting a coupled lifting line/panel method solver and a successive refinement with panel solver and optimization techniques, is presented. In order to validate this procedure and provide information about these propulsors, experimental results at towing tank and cavitation tunnel are compared with numerical predictions. Moreover, additional results obtained by means of a commercial RANS solver, not directly adopted in the design loop, are also presented, allowing to stress the relative merits and shortcomings of the different numerical approaches. © 2012 Stefano Gaggero et al.",

      "abstract": "This paper deals with the buckling strength of typical ship stiffened panels built in fibreglass composite laminates. The results obtained applying analytical formulations based on equilibrium and potential energy equations are compared with the ones obtained by linearised eigenvalue analyses of rather detailed finite-element models. Analytical formulations consider an elementary panel only, accounting for the boundary effects of stiffeners surrounding its edges, while FE models fully describe the interactions among plate and stiffeners as a whole. A sensitivity analysis to highlight the most influencing parameters in the problem is also presented.So far no systematic scantling assessment of buckling behaviour of hull shell and deck panels seems to be recommended by classification societies' rules for pleasure crafts made in composite materials. Thus, this paper aims at illustrating the application limits of analytical methods, natural candidates to become the basis of rule requirements. Difficulties in the evaluation of torsion behaviour of stiffeners and of corresponding buckling modes involving both the plate and the stiffeners are highlighted. Some concluding suggestions for rule scantling assessment formulations are eventually provided. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

      "abstract": "As a matter of facts, welding is the joining method widely applied in shipbuilding and since the first applications it became evident that fatigue failures start exactly at weld seams. In the last decades, classification societies introduced explicit fatigue strength check formulae in their rules for shipbuilding and, in late nineties, some rules adopted local approaches in lieu of the so-called nominal stress approach. Current editions of rules mainly reference documents of the International Institute of Welding (IIW) and recommend the structural (hot-spot) stress approach. This paper is aimed at fatigue strength assessment of attachments of bulb plate stiffeners (Holland Profile), typical of shipbuilding structures, by applying local approaches proposed by IIW and in open literature. The application of these methods in the captioned cases is not always straightforward nor sometimes possible, neither effective. Difficulties in following the IIW suggestions for the FE modeling of relatively complex geometries are shown. Basically, the bulb itself is a 3D component interacting with 2D shells surrounding it: the 3D vs 2D mismatch is the source of complexity. Since a reference thickness of the bulb cannot be identified, even identification of stress points in postprocessing of FE analyses is difficult, being often cause of scatter and/or disagreement among different approaches. Comparisons among approaches and with available experimental data of tests carried out in the Ship Structures Laboratory of the University of Genova and in the Institute of Ship Structural Design and Analysis of the Hamburg University of Technology provide a general view of this topic and offer a critical review of the application of local approaches in rather challenging test cases evaluating, as far as possible, effects of weld geometry on fatigue strength.",

      "abstract": "Propeller design requirements are nowadays more and more stringent, demanding not only to provide high efficiency and to avoid cavitation, but including also requirements in terms of low induced vibrations and radiated noise. Ducted propellers may provide the opportunity to reduce these negative effects or to increase the efficiency of heavily loaded propellers. This paper presents the development of a measuring device for the cavitation tunnel, in order to evaluate the forces on the duct. The measurement tool was designed and realized in house and it is at the same time the support of the duct to be placed in the cavitation tunnel and the device measuring the acting forces. By means of the developed measuring device, two ducted propellers with different characteristics (namely with accelerating and decelerating duct) have been tested at cavitation tunnel. The results of these two test series were compared with towing tank open water test data, showing a good agreement. Moreover, cavitation tests were also carried out, focusing the attention on the phenomena on the duct and on other interesting characteristics, such as thrust breakdown, providing useful data for future validations of numerical propeller design and analysis tool.",

      "abstract": "This paper deals with strength of composite sandwich panels typically used in pleasure boats and naval industry. The focus is on the influence of fabrication processes onto the mechanical behavior, namely onto buckling strength. Both, experimental and numerical analyses were carried out in the Ship Structures Laboratory of the University of Genova on rectangular specimens, whose dimensions and geometry were conceived to induce buckling collapse, being this one a typical failure mode under compressive loading for thin skins sandwich. Tests on both hand layup fabricated and infusion made panels were carried out measuring compressive load vs. shortening and lateral deflection. Videos of the tests were taken and used to gather some measurements and to assess failure time and location. Experimental results were compared with different numerical models, developed considering large deformations in the PVC core under buckling conditions. Various finite element types and different implementation were considered to model complex interactions between core and skins. The conclusions of this paper aim to provide designers of pleasure and naval crafts with some hints about different strategies to build up costeffective numerical models for predicting buckling and post-buckling behavior of sandwich hulls, taking advantage of calibrations obtained through experimental testing.",

This detail was benchmarked in the Technical Committee III. 2 report (Fatigue & Fracture) of the last ISSC 2009 Congress and significant scatter among results obtained by various fatigue assessment procedures was found, even when considering specific corrections of the commonly applied approaches for such type of welded joints. This paper aims at providing verification of a Notch Stress Intensity Factor (N-SIF) based approach in a case currently of concern within the shipping community, namely the Strain Energy Density (SED) approach, that is a promising method for fatigue assessment of welded structural components proposed in open literature. Comparisons with experimental and numerical available results are provided with results obtained applying other approaches, highlighting advantages and disadvantages of the SED approach in the captioned case.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, the structural design of mast and rigging of sail yachts is presented from a practical viewpoint, highlighting main idealization concepts of structural behavior. At first, the analytical procedures available in open literature are briefly reviewed, considering current industrial practice in scantling design of sail yachts. Applicable rules are considered as well. Then, more complex scantling procedures, taking advantage of modern computation facilities, are presented. Indeed, finite element (FE) analyses are more and more routinely used by designers. However, large deformations and slacking behavior of rigging and sails require nonlinear calculations, making convergence of algorithms difficult. In this case, limit states should be carefully defined; description of environmental actions and loads application on the structural system need engineering judgment, skill of FE analysts and sailing practice to completely understand the performance of the structure. Examples of applications on a typical modern sail yacht highlight that the design of these fascinating slender structures is really challenging and their design is still largely based on empiricism. © 2010 COPPE/UFRJ.",

The aim is to compare the results obtained by various methods and to analyze capabilities and difficulties of each in the practical application. The numerical calculations were carried out by the widely applied finite element method, according to the guidelines of the International Institute of Welding (IIW) or following other methods proposed in open literature.

Fricke (Technical University Hamburg-Harburg) in the framework of the European Network of Excellence MARSTRUCT, which involved several research institutions in this round robin. Fatigue testing of some specimens was carried out during the EU funded research programme, thus providing the experimental target for the numerical calculations of the four variants of the examined details.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, local approaches for determining the fatigue strength of welded joints are commonly used in engineering practices, and regulations describe their field of application and guide designers in the execution of the calculations with numerical methods that are now extensively used. The aim of this paper is to verify the application of the structural stress approach to a welded joint used in naval construction and repair of particularly complex geometries. The structural detail is a butt weld between two bulb stiffeners, strengthened by a plate (counterpiece) welded above the bevelled but unwelded bulbs. The study has been conducted by following the guidelines of the method recommended by the International Institute of Welding (IIW), and the alternative method proposed by Xiao and Yamada in 2004 has also been applied. Large scale fatigue testing of the aforementioned joints and collapse testing on models, conducted at the DINAV Naval Structure Laboratory, have allowed subsequent comparison: indeed, the numerical analyses have been conducted with no knowledge of the experimental results. The various calculations, carried out in accordance with the standards but with different interpretations, have shown a significant spread of results, highlighting that, in the case of particularly complex geometries, this type of approach is not simple to apply, and the IIW guidelines do not provide an unambiguous method for determining joint fatigue strength. However, from the methods proposed, using those which best meet the general criteria of good FEM modelling and considering other effects certainly present in heavy structures such as misalignments, estimates of joint fatigue lifespan may be obtained which are in substantial agreement with the experimental results. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.",

The complex geometry of the structure as well as the loading conditions were responsible of premature fracture failures localized in the neighborhood of the bolted connection between the column pipe and the basement plate. Retrofitting solutions and appropriate countermeasures were proposed after long lasting hydrodynamic and structural analyses that needed to account for very strict operational and time constraints. The fracture strength as well as the vibration behavior of the structure were considered taking advantage of both numerical FE calculations and experimental in-situ measurements. The parallel numerical and experimental analyses leaded to a set of modifications of the structure hereunder described in detail. The integration among experimental and theoretical results concurred to obtain a suitable solution for a quite complex case study because it allowed improving aspects related to both the strength and the loading conditions of the structure. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.",

The first structural detail deals with the stress increase at thickness steps in plate structures. For two different cases the structural hot-spot stress is determined with different types of models. The second structural detail is the penetration of a longitudinal through a bulkhead with four different hot-spots. The third structural detail deals with the assessment of root failure of single-sided fillet welds. The welded joint of the end connection of a rectangular hollow section member is taken as an example. The relevant stress here is the effective notch stress in the fictitiously rounded notch root. In the paper, the different modelling techniques applied are described. The results are compared with each other and sources of scatter are identified.

The aim of this work is to apply the structural stress approach to a welded joint used in shipbuilding and in ship repairs and to verify the applicability of such method to a rather complex geometry.

The calculations, carried out according to the standards but with different approaches and interpretations, showed a significant dispersion of the results. However, it was possible to highlight that, especially for complex geometries, such kind of local approaches is not easy to implement and that the guidelines of IIW do not give a definite method for the estimate of the fatigue strength of the joint. However, selecting among the proposed procedures the ones that better match the good practice of the finite element analysis and considering the effects of misalignments and irregularities of the typical shipbuilding practice, estimates of the fatigue strength in substantial agreement with the experimental results can be obtained.",

      "abstract": "This chapter overviews the maintenance of ship and offshore structures, introducing first preventive maintenance and protection methods. Especially as far as corrosion is concerned, protection is necessary since this degradation effect is unavoidable for materials used in shipbuilding and it is economically unfeasible to use corrosion-free materials.Temporary repairs are then examined, mainly referring to current onboard practice: even if standards and regulations exist, harmonization and integration are still to be achieved and surveyors' skills and experience govern. As a matter of fact, for temporary repairs, decisions need to be taken on a case-by-case basis, considering not only technical issues but also operational and safety constraints.Permanent repairs of degradation effects are presented, which are largely based on the same criteria as those used for new structures. Structures that have deteriorated beyond the acceptable limits are generally replaced by cropping and renewing. Attention should be paid to causes of degradation and fabrication of new parts in order to avoid even worse and more rapid damage. Finally, examination and tests of repairs are briefly summarized. © 2008 Woodhead Publishing Limited. All rights reserved.",

      "abstract": "Reasons for inspection and inspection events are first described in this chapter, highlighting peculiarities that make ships and offshore structures among the most challenging to inspect. Actually, ships are the largest structures ever built, moving all around the world: this makes inspections different from those of land-based structures for a number of reasons.Factors influencing inspection performances are then commented on in detail, recognising that it is not always possible to quantify the reliability of the complex process called 'detection and sizing of degradation', depending indeed on many parameters not always easy to be defined quantitatively. However, it would be enviable to attempt to do so rationally as far as possible. Current inspection practice is examined from the viewpoint of surveyors, who have to follow different instructions depending on their role but mainly relying on their experience. Methods for detection and sizing of degradation are discussed; traditional methods and future trends are presented for corrosion, fracture and mechanical damages. © 2008 Woodhead Publishing Limited.

      "abstract": "Within the Network of Excellence MARSTRUCT a round robin was carried out where three different structural details were assessed by calculating structural hot-spot stresses or, if applicable, effective notch stresses. The first structural detail deals with the stress increase at thickness steps in plate structures. For two different cases the structural hot-spot stress is determined with different types of models. The second structural detail is the penetration of a longitudinal through a bulkhead with four different hot-spots. The third structural detail deals with the assessment of root failure of single-sided fillet welds. The welded joint of the end connection of a rectangular hollow section member is taken as example. The relevant stress is here the effective notch stress in the fictitiously rounded notch root. In the paper the different modelling techniques applied are described. The results are compared with each other and sources of scatter are identified.

      "abstract": "Ship structures are likely to be subject to age-related deterioration such as corrosion wastage, cracking or mechanical damage. It has reportedly been recognised that such age-related deterioration is almost always involved in the catastrophic failures of ship structures including total losses. While such accidents typically cause concern to the public, maintenance and repair of aged structures is quite costly and complex. It is thus of great importance to develop advanced technologies allowing for proper management and control of such age-related deterioration. This paper summarises the report of the ISSC 2006 Committee V.6 presenting current practices, recent advances and future trends on condition assessment of aged ships. This includes assessment of the structural condition in view of the serviceability and safety, methods for repair, quantification of strength of deteriorated and repaired ships (as well as criteria for acceptable damage), with due account of the uncertainties involved. Consideration is also given to cost-benefit and risk-based decision procedures for remedial actions.",

      "abstract": "In the framework of a wider research project, large scale testing of composite sandwich panels has been carried out at the DINAV shipbuilding laboratory. The skins of the sandwich are made of fibre glass epoxy prepreg and the core consists of a syntactic epoxy foam. Strain gages have been bonded on the outer skins and also located in between the core and the skins. The captioned material is currently used for small components of naval ships (e.g. shields, stanchions, etc.) either in single skin laminates or sandwiches: the final goal of the project is to study its applicability in building pleasure craft hulls, taking advantage of its high strength. The large scale tests have been completed by usual testing on small scale specimens, according to well-known international standards and analytical and finite elements (FE) numerical models have been calibrated with the experimental data. Different options of FE codes have been investigated in order to catch their capabilities and approximations in modelling the composite material and their damage up to collapse. Some advice on the behaviour of quite large sandwich panels is reported, highlighting the effects of the size of the structure on the material mechanical properties.",

      "abstract": "In previous years, several large-scale specimens have been fatigue tested in the Ship Structures laboratory of the Dipartimento di Ingegneria Navale e Tecnologie Marine (DINAV) of the University of Genova (Italy). They represent the crossing of a T-shaped beam into deep web plates, simulating either a primary supporting member or bulkhead plating. Each specimen is characterized by two joints, both watertight but with different geometry. The purpose of this paper is to review all the available test results using calculation methods for fatigue strength of welded structural details, namely: nominal stress approach, local stress approaches and the fracture mechanics approach. Test results allow SN curves to be drawn which can be used for these and similar details, quite common in shipbuilding. Moreover, calibration of stress concentration factors and coefficients in the various fatigue life calculation methods is possible using the experimental data. © 2007 The Authors.

      "abstract": "The paper compares the scantling criteria of rules individually issued in the last years by classification societies, with the recently released Common Structural Rules (CSR).The evolution of the rules background criteria for scantlings is examined, also in connection with the debate at IMO level of the concept of Goal Based Design. The attention is focussed on the progress towards the identification of reference scenarios able to clarify the content of the rules themselves. A clearer definition of reference environmental conditions, of the corrosion model and of failure modes are the fields where this trend is recognised. Less evident is the identification of scenarios for accidental conditions. After this first general analysis on the goals of rules, the evolution in terms of consistency of the formulations to the target is examined. Evolution trends in the definition of characteristic loads and strength values and of combination criteria are seen from a probabilistic and risk based viewpoint. Changes in the formats for design checks of structures are also monitored. © 2007: The Royal Institution of Naval Architects.",

However, the complexity of the new rulesneedsto be faced by computer software issued by the class societies themselves. This article presents the results of some preliminary structuraldesign calculations, carried out according to five different classification societies’ rules (BV, DnV, GL, LR and RINA) and using the associated softwares, on a small double hull tankerbuilt in the nineties. In view of the possible lengthening of the ship, the scantling design hasbeen carried out on the midship section, aiming to compare the different rules, requirements andcriteria before and after lengthening. An analysis of general check formulations has been firstly carried out, highlighting similarities and differences in the scantling criteria. Then, results of the exercise have been compared to evaluatethe best solution for lengthening, and rules requirements have been commented on in the light ofthe methods and criteria previously reported with the aim to contribute to the rules harmonization process. © 2006 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

      "abstract": "Correct management of fuel supply involves commercial, technical and safety implications. This paper deals with malfunctions of two strokes slow speed Diesel engines and related wearing effects on cylinder liners caused by inappropriate fuel quality. Combustion process of fuels has been examined, highlighting parameters giving malfunctioning and wearing effects. Relationship between characteristics of fuels and damages are quite complex and malfunctions explanations are seldom clear and unique. However, the present work sets an interpretation key of involved phenomena. A sequence of events, linked by cause-effect relationships, is proposed, which is able to explain how the fuel viscosity and some related parameters could wear the engine cylinder liners and cause malfunctions. Such general scheme is supported by numerical simulations and applied to a case study. Mathematical models relevant to single steps of the process, available in literature, have been calibrated in order to obtain results in agreement with experimental data. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group.",

The comparison is performed first on a general basis, highlighting features and trends in the evolution of the rules for ships scantling in recent years. A selection of main rules formulations is then examined in more details and a numerical comparison of the application of rules to some structural elements in the cargo area amidship of typical longitudinally stiffened vessels. The aim is to provide an external qualitative and, to some extent, quantitative overview of the ongoing harmonization process of shipbuilding scantling regulations. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group.",
