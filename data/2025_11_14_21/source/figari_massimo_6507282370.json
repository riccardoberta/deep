      "abstract": "Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) stand as a cutting-edge solution for reducing emissions and improving the resilience of naval hybrid power systems. However, their effectiveness depends on several factors, including operational and reliability requirements, power system configuration and electrification level, load profiles, and the chosen Energy Management Strategy (EMS). Strategic loading (SL), a core function of modern EMS, plays a key role in optimising energy use, enhancing performance, reducing costs, and ensuring reliability during mission-critical scenarios. However, comprehensive analyses on BESS integration to address the actual operational needs of naval ship energy infrastructures are often insufficiently explored in the literature. This paper presents an optimisation-based SL approach for integrating BESS into naval ships through performance assessment. A range of BESS configurations was evaluated based on power and energy specifications to minimise fuel consumption, improve generator load balancing, and enhance redundancy. Real-world load data from a conventionally propelled naval vessel were used to validate the approach. Results show that properly sized BESS systems significantly reduce fuel use and increases overall electric load stability and availability. The proposed method supports model-based EMS design and enables future retrofitting of conventional naval ships.",

      "abstract": "The autonomy of transport systems presents a transformative opportunity to enhance logistics efficiency, improve safety, and support decarbonization. In the maritime sector, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has been working since 2016 to develop a mandatory regulatory framework for Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASSs), aiming to finalize a comprehensive code. Simultaneously, pilot projects are underway in national waters under the oversight of national administrations. Naval applications of autonomous ships demonstrate their potential, as emerging doctrines highlight their strategic and operational advantages. Although the military sector is not governed at the international level, safely managing interactions between military and commercial MASSs is crucial for ensuring safe navigation. Classification societies play a vital role in achieving high safety standards and ensuring regulatory compliance. This study aims to propose a framework for certifying maritime autonomous vessels. Through a thorough analysis of the existing literature and by identifying gaps, this study outlines a structured pathway to facilitate the certification and operation of MASSs, addressing key technical, operational, and safety considerations. This research contributes to designing a risk-informed approach for the development of autonomous surface vehicles.",

      "abstract": "As ship automation advances, maritime training must adapt to ensure proficiency in manual operations during automation failures. Traditional Maritime Education and Training (MET) lacks standardized, simulator-based assessments for critical tasks such as manual generator synchronization, leading to skill gaps in high-risk scenarios. This study evaluates the effectiveness of high-fidelity engine room simulators in improving situational awareness, cognitive load management, and decision-making under stress. A Simulation-Based Training (SBT) framework using the Wärtsilä TechSim engine room simulator was implemented at the University of Genoa (UNIGE), aligning with the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification, and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW) (Reg. III/1, Section A-III/1; Reg. I/14). Pre-and post-training assessments, simulator logs, and instructor observations demonstrated significant improvements in synchronization execution time, fault diagnosis, and emergency response efficiency. However, the absence of structured, simulator-driven competency assessments in MET limits objective skill measurement and training effectiveness. Drawing insights from aviation competency models, this study proposes a structured assessment framework to standardize competency verification, enhance training methodologies, and better equip seafarers for automation-driven ship operations.",

      "abstract": "The shipping industry significantly influences global greenhouse gas emissions through a predominant fossil fuel-based fleet. Regulating bodies are continuously developing rules to reduce the shipping carbon footprint. Adopting low-carbon fuels is considered a step toward achieving the Paris Agreement’s goals; however, it represents a significant paradigm shift in ship design. This work aims to illustrate a methodology for the feasibility assessment of alternative-fuelled vessels considering technical, environmental, and economic perspectives. The technical feasibility focuses on ship propulsion, fuel system safety, and design parameters. The environmental impact evaluation is based on the Tank-to-Wake and the Well-to-Wake approaches. The cost assessment is performed by estimating capital and operational expenditures, considering only the modifications required by the new fuel. The methodology addresses new-building and retrofit solutions, and can be used as a decision support tool for selecting the best strategy. A key output of the methodology is the cargo emission footprint, expressed in equivalent carbon dioxide per cargo unit. Using a handysize bulk carrier as a case study, this work points out the effects of using methanol as an alternative fuel, highlighting its impact on market and transport strategies in a sector evolving towards Eco-Delivery services.",

      "abstract": "Naval ship design must balance multiple conflicting requirements, including the need for fast response times and high speeds, often leading to large and complex hybrid propulsion systems. At the same time, the decarbonisation of ship operations and the shipping industry has become one of the most concerning topics for the maritime community. Even if the military sector has not been driven yet by this regulatory framework, decarbonisation is also becoming a hot topic for the navies. Additionally, short-term power loads encompass numerous demanding applications. The impact of this type of load on the performance of the shipboard power system influences power quality, and load levelling has been proven to be one of the critical power management strategies for new naval shipboard electric plants. Furthermore, decarbonisation and electric pulse management require pervasive automation systems to balance reduced crew sizes effectively. In recent years, Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) have emerged as effective tools for reducing green-house gas emissions, as well as for load levelling and peak shaving. These systems support power management strategies, addressing conflicting naval ship design requirements and optimising these critical concerns. BESS based hybrid propulsion is a promising solution for enhancing the energy efficiency of naval ships. It has been proven to be a reliable and flexible design option for improving the power quality of the electric grid. However, BESS requires space, weight tolerance, and cost expenditures to match all other military operational requirements in one convenient, optimal shipboard power plant. The paper outlines an optimisation-based approach to size a BESS-based hybrid propulsion architecture for naval ships, primarily focusing on reducing environmental foot print, increasing efficiency, and improving power grid reliability. The optimisation aims to minimise the ship exhaust emissions in terms of equivalent CO<inf>2</inf>. The frontline ship type case study has been analysed while ma noeuvring in restricted waters and deep seas in a given pseudo-random operating condition extracted from actual data, showing potential interest in a new, energy-efficient, and resilient solution. For comprehensive benchmarking, the case study has been further examined and discussed with different sizing configurations, and each case study has been ranked with a set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The study shows that, despite the increasing size and weight of the BESS to reduce fuel consumption, analysing different solutions with a model-based strategy for the hybrid plant gives interesting trade-offs during the design phase while leaving space for new research directions.",

The optimization aims to minimize the ship exhaust emissions of equivalent CO2 using a Well-to- Wake approach. The algorithm has been applied to a small ferry operating in a marine-protected area. The passage through an environmentally sensitive area has led to assessing local emissions of other pollutants such as SO x, NO x, and particulates. Dealing with innovative solutions, it proved appropriate to make a preliminary economic calculation estimating the annual costs of fuel based on current market prices.",

      "abstract": "The harvesting of wind energy and its transformation into a thrust force for ship propulsion are gaining in popularity due to the expected benefit in fuel consumption and emission reductions. To exploit these benefits, a proper matching between the conventional diesel engine-screw propeller propulsion plant and the wind-assisted plant is key. This paper aims to present a method and a code for the preliminary sizing of a ship propulsion plant based on a diesel engine, a controllable pitch propeller, and one or more Flettner rotors. A mathematical model describing the behaviour of the rotor in terms of propulsive thrust and power is proposed. The rotor model has been integrated into an existing diesel propulsion model in order to evaluate the ship’s fuel consumption. The ship’s propulsion model is written in a parametric form with respect to the following design parameters: ship dimensions and resistance-speed curve, propeller diameter, engine power, rotor geometry, and true wind conditions. The methodology helps in evaluating the engine–propeller working points and eventually the total ship propulsive power, including the power required to spin the rotor. It provides a way to compare wind-assisted propulsive solutions in terms of fuel consumption and CO<inf>2</inf> emissions. A 3000-ton Ro-Ro/Pax ferry has been selected as a case study.

      "abstract": "Following the International Maritime Organization’s goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the interest in the application of wind-assisted ship propulsion (WASP) in maritime transportation is on the rise. Although a variety of WASP systems exist, the application in maritime shipping is still limited, especially in the case of kite sails. This paper presents a numerical model to carry out a theoretical assessment of the influence of the kite planform area and wind speed on the aerodynamic performance of a kite sail providing propulsive assistance to a 75 m long ship having a Series 60 hull. A static kite sail is assumed, on which a tail wind generates a thrust force to pull the vessel via a tether. While the mass of the kite is neglected, that of the tether is accounted for. A model is implemented for the tensioned tether having a catenary profile. The results generally show a positive correlation between the aerodynamic forces and the kite parameters. As expected, the output parameter values corresponding to the optimal angle of attack for a range of vessel speeds are also found to increase with an increasing relative wind speed. It is concluded that a static 320 m<sup>2</sup> kite sail would be sufficient to meet the entire propulsion requirements of the vessel under consideration under appropriate wind conditions.",

      "abstract": "A deep insight into the manoeuvring characterisation of a wider class of Azimuthal Stern Drive Escort tugs (ASD) is undertaken with the scope of defining a real-time parametric manoeuvring simulation code for the free-sailing and towing operations. In the part I of the work a physics-based 4-DOF prediction parametric tool for the dynamic behaviour of the ASD tug has been developed, and a validation with model-scale Escort-towing tests has been presented. In the present paper a second validation methodology, based on full-scale measurements, is discussed. This verification envisages simulator's capability of describing the free-sailing performance of a different but compatible hull, having dimensions, propulsion, skeg characteristics significantly different with respect to the “parent design” used to develop the tool. The experimental campaign involves the measurements purposely performed during sea trials onto two sister-ship ASD new-buildings (RM3213). Turning circle, zig-zag manoeuvres, and Dieudonne’ spiral tests are deeply analysed and the results used for validation purpose. The simulation results showed a satisfactory agreement with the full scale manoeuvres, positively demonstrating the ability of the parametric mathematical formulations to forecast customised tug manoeuvrability for tug design purposes.",

The ship implements an innovative propulsion power generation and storage system based on a CODOGOL (COmbined Diesel Or Gas Or eLectric) architecture and a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS). The proposed modular solution is also suitable for retrofitting applications and represents an innovation in the state of the art of hybrid propulsion systems for big, front-line naval ships. The shipboard BESS is used as a backup power source to ensure minimum generator operation (MGO) mode reliability requirements. The benefits of the proposed solution are discussed in detail, highlighting a reduction of the operating costs and fuel consumption, as well as low pollutant emissions and Life Cycle Costs.

      "abstract": "The harvesting of wind energy and its transformation into a thrust force for the ship propulsion is the basics of Wind-Assisted Ship Propulsion (WASP). The concept has been gaining in popularity in the last years due to the expected benefits in emission reduction. To exploit the benefits, a proper integration between the conventional diesel engine-screw propeller propulsion plant and the WASP is mandatory. This paper aims to study the integration of the Flettner rotor technology with a conventional ship propulsion plant with controllable pitch propellers. The method allows to evaluate the engine-propeller working points and, eventually the total ship propulsive power, considering the influence of the rotor and the wind conditions. The total ship power is modelled on the amount of power required to spin the rotor, providing a way to compare hybrid propulsive solutions in terms of fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. A 3000 ton Ro-Ro/Pax ferry has been selected as a case study. Results on the parametric analysis of rotor dimensions and wind conditions are presented. Assuming fixed wind conditions, the effect of the rotor at different ship speeds is shown.",

      "abstract": "The ship's dynamic performance (acceleration, turning ability, crash stop) strongly depends on both the propulsion system and its control. The steady-state performance analysis of propulsion systems has shown that onboard energy usage benefits from the employment of simulation techniques. Besides, these techniques provide significant advantages in designing the control logic of sophisticated and complex systems. The present work summarizes the research activities conducted to develop suitable simulation framework for the propulsion systems of naval vessels. Theoretical and mathematical models have thus been developed in this paper to simulate the propulsion of ships. Model-scale experiments and full-scale trials have been used to increase the fidelity of the models. The research outcome is a conceptual framework and a fully validated parametric software representing the vessel's dynamic behaviour and propulsion system in steady-state and abrupt manoeuvres. Thanks to this simulation framework, the propulsion control system could be designed, validated, and calibrated before its installation on board, reducing the commissioning time and minimising the propulsion control system's onboard calibration during the acceptance sea trials.",

      "abstract": "Hybrid turbochargers can become an attractive solution for new built and retrofitted ship power plants, as their use can result in increasing the plant efficiency and reducing emissions. This study aims at computationally investigating the hybrid turbocharger effects on a large marine dual-fuel four-stroke engine performance and emissions characteristics as well as determining its electrical generator optimal size for the case of a ship power plant considering an actual operating profile. An existing model of a large marine four-stroke dual-fuel engine of the zero/one-dimensional type, which was developed in the commercial software GT-Power, is extended to include the hybrid turbocharger sub-model. This model is subsequently employed to carry out a parametric investigation considering a wide range for the hybrid turbocharger electric motor power. The derived results are analysed to identify the variations of the investigated dual fuel engine performance and emissions parameters in the whole engine operating envelope at both the diesel and gas modes, whilst taking into account the engine and its components operational limits. For the considered annual load profile, the results demonstrate that the optimal nominal size of the hybrid turbocharger electric motor power is 300 kW and leads to an annual energy surplus between 2% and 3% of the annually delivered engine mechanical energy. This study benefits the quantification of the hybrid turbocharger impact on large marine dual fuel four-stroke engines as well as the ship energy efficiency, thus providing useful decision support to facilitate the shipboard implementation of this technology.",

      "abstract": "The propulsion system of modern conventional submarines features multiple energy conversion and storage devices and users, which operate closely interconnected. The basic design and sizing of the components commonly rely on steady-state calculations, neglecting the interactions between the propulsion system components. An adequately tailored simulation-based approach is beneficial to ensure the design fulfills the operating requirements in the advanced design phases. Time-domain simulation provides information otherwise unavailable with standard design tools. Moreover, the decision-making process involved in modeling the system and developing the simulation tool shares several similarities with the actual design of the physical system. This paper proposes a simulation model of the propulsion system of a conventional submarine. The theoretical aspects, hypotheses, and simplifications are first discussed. The proposed approach is then applied to a case study to show the potential benefits arising from dynamic simulation when evaluating the performance of a conventional submarine unit.",

      "abstract": "A deep insight into the manoeuvring characterisation of a broader class of Azimuthal Stern Drive Escort tugs (ASD) is undertaken with the scope of defining a parametric manoeuvring simulation code for the free-sailing and towing operations. To this end, given a simple set of tug design parameters (main dimensions, skeg size, azimuthal size, propeller pitch, main engines, etc.), a physics-based 4-DOF mathematical prediction tool for the dynamic behaviour of the ASD tug has been developed in calm seas. Two independent validation processes have been provided to prove the suitability of the modelling: the first model-scale, while the second full-scale. The present paper presents the free-sailing full-scale validation of a different but compatible hull, having dimensions, propulsion, skeg characteristics significantly different with respect to the “parent-design” (RM2812) used to develop the code principally. The verification involved the measurements purposely performed during sea trials onto two sister-ship ASD new-buildings (RM3213).",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a methodology to develop the control systems of a surface vessel by using both computational fluid dynamics techniques and model-based control design. The model-based control design is supported by a simulation platform where both the ship hydrodynamics and the propulsion plant are modelled together. The application of CFD is related to the direct evaluation of the hull forces in the ship hydrodynamic model, for different manoeuvring conditions. The developed design tool is essential in the preliminary design phase, as a benchmark to test the control algorithms for autonomous ships. The comparison between numerical assessment and regression-based formulae has been performed on non-standard manoeuvres to quantify the difference in thrust allocation from the point of view of control design. Eventually, to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, the results of the sea trials for different manoeuvres are shown.",

This study is devoted to identifying a proper mathematical model to be included in a dynamic manoeuvring simulator. The hydrodynamic problem is therefore decomposed in the hull and skeg components. The hydrodynamic characteristics of the skeg were so explored by varying its span and chord systematically, allowing deep insight into the physics of both components and their mutual interaction. The distribution of the forces acting on hull and skeg were studied in detail in their dependence from the skeg geometrical characteristics. Suitable mathematical formulations for the skeg forces were implemented in an MMG-like manoeuvring model-based onto the CFD captive simulations. Lastly, the impact on the tug's manoeuvrability of the previously mentioned variations was then investigated. Turning, Zig-Zag, Escort Capability, Escort Mirror ability and Escort Stability manoeuvres were simulated. The results of these manoeuvres are presented, showing the great potential of this manoeuvring model in representing a wider class of Escort tugs.",

      "abstract": "An industrial-academic collaboration between Rosetti Marino shipyard and University of Genoa presided over a deep theoretical and experimental insight into the maneuvering performances of a new escort tug family. The presented z-drive azimuthal stern drive class is characterized by high intact/damage stability margins, good maneuvering capability, and stable behavior during escort indirect assistance. The project addresses three main research areas: hydrodynamic design of the hull with escort capability, simulation of the escort capabilities in different operational scenario, and development of control logics that will allow autonomous or unmanned operations. The tug design concept is supported by a customized simulation tool that enables the evaluation of the free-sailing and towing maneuvering characteristics for Azimuth Stern Drive (ASD) tugs at high-speed (Escort) and low speed (Harbor Assistance) in a real-time environment. The paper describes the methodological approach adopted for the design and maneuvering characterization of such a class, across some preliminary results. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculations and towing tank tests have been performed onto a prototype tug hull in order to assess the hull design and to infer simulation models able to describe the behavior of a family of vessels. In particular, the propulsion and maneuverability aspects in escort operations are deeply investigated.",

      "abstract": "Intelligent and/or autonomous vehicle technologies are rapidly growing to meet the needs of marine safety and transport efficiency. One of the requirements to manage autonomous vehicles includes the integration between route planning and automatic motion control. In the authors’ opinion, the latter could be sketched in three different layers: obstacle detection, planning and actuation. Moreover, the three layers should be able to interact in real-time. Dealing with such a challenging task, one of the best techniques to develop and test the logic is the use of the time-domain simulation. In the present work, a simulation model, integrating a path planning algorithm in the presence of obstacles with a track keeping controller, is developed. The path planning is based on a modified version of the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT*) algorithm. The track keeping is based on the Line-of-Sight (LOS) waypoints navigation for underactuated vessels. To achieve more reliable results, a detailed ship simulation model is used as a benchmark. Different scenarios and navigation modes are successfully tested, and the results are presented and analysed.",

The investigation is based on model tests performed at the towing tank of Genoa University, where the trim influence on the hydrodynamic resistances of a high-speed vessel and a slower mini-cruiser is investigated for various operating conditions. The purpose of this work is to provide possible indications for the operating trim of passenger and/or naval vessels. In this regard, the experimental results of the mini-cruiser are compared with the full-scale data of a Ro-Ro passenger ship, assuming a similar behavior for the two applications. The consistency of the achieved results is shown in the perspective of the different examined hull geometries. To further improve the ship energy efficiency, a particular waste recycling technology, aimed at obtaining fuel oil from sludge, is also considered in the final part of the article. The main idea is to produce fuel for the ship engines through a pyrolysis process to be carried out directly onboard, to obtain further fuel savings from waste products of the vessel.",

In this framework, the availability of a reliable manoeuvrability prediction model is beneficial. This paper presents a novel 4-DOF parametric manoeuvrability model dedicated to the manoeuvrability analysis of Azimuthal Stern Drive Escort Tugs. An extensive captive model testing campaign is exploited to develop the mathematical model, conceived following the MMG model concept. The modelling pursues a physics-based approach aimed at characterising the complete manoeuvring hydrodynamics of the vessel. The hull+skeg and azimuthals force contributions are analysed separately and are then coupled to analyse their interaction. A complete, real-time simulator is presented, which is capable of simulating the dynamics of a towing convoy in several real case scenarios. This capability is envisaged to become a very useful tool for the tug designer, allowing to address realistic operational conditions with a focus on manoeuvring capabilities, risk assessment, risk mitigation, operational safety and effectiveness.",

      "abstract": "Fishing is an energy-intensive economic activity. Research in several fields is conducted to improve the energy and environmental profile of fishing vessels. As regards the technical measures, the assessment of benefits is often hampered by boundary conditions that are difficult to quantify and side effects that are difficult to unravel. This study examined the impact of a fluoropolymer-based fouling release paint on the fuel consumption rate of a Mediterranean bottom trawler. The analysis of a series of sea trial campaigns allowed for a quantitative and qualitative comparison of fuel consumption rate during the regular fishing activities. Comparing the fuel consumption rate before and after the application of the fluoropolymer-based foul-release coating, a reduction in fuel consumption rate was observed and quantified. Other advantages are discussed in this paper regarding the reduction of GHG emission, and the more environmental-friendly approach using biocide-free and non-banned products.",

      "abstract": "The compliance with the navigation rules plays a primary role in the development of routing algorithms to be applied in autonomous navigation. For such a reason this paper presents the mathematical formulations necessary to implement the Collision Regulations (COLREGs) within a previously developed ship path planning algorithm. The proposed approach is designed to be part of a decision support system for the bridge operators, in order to enhance traditional navigation; or, looking forward, to be part of the autonomous ship guidance system. Unlike other approaches that can be found in the scientific literature, the proposed work relies on the algebra of vectors, in order to describe the different scenarios as provided for in the COLREGs. The formulations to handle: head-on, crossing and overtaking, are formalized, described in detail and discussed. Eventually, some test cases are presented to show the effectiveness of the implementation of the proposed modeling into a Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT∗) algorithm. A simplified ship simulator is embedded in the algorithm to generate feasible solutions, taking into account the ship's manoeuvring capability.",

      "abstract": "A turbocharged diesel engine numerical model, suitable for real-time ship manoeuvre simulation, is presented in this paper. While some engine components (mainly the turbocharger, intercooler and manifolds) are modelled by a filling and emptying approach, the cylinder simulation is based on a set of five-dimensional numerical matrices (each matrix is generated by means of a more traditional thermodynamic model based on in-cylinder actual cycle). The new cylinder calculation approach strongly reduces the engine transient computation time, making it possible to transform the simulation model into a real-time executable application. As a case study, the simulation methodology is applied to a high speed four stroke turbocharged marine diesel engine, whose design and off design running data are available from the technical sheet. In order to verify the suitability of the proposed model in real-time simulation applications, a yacht propulsion plant simulator is developed. Numerical results in ship acceleration and deceleration manoeuvres are shown, reducing the simulation running time of 99% in comparison with the corresponding in-cylinder actual cycle engine model.",

The optimization is performed in accordance to a minimum fuel consumption strategy taking also into account ship motions and comfort. The optimization is carried out in a discretized space-time domain: the ship voyage is parametrized as a multi-stage decision process in order to formulate a dynamic programming optimization problem. Waves and wind conditions are estimated for each route segment by weather forecasting maps then seakeeping related indexes and fuel oil consumption are computed taking into account wave-induced ship motions and added resistance. The best routing solution is thus selected by a dynamic programming algorithm developed and implemented by the authors. Results and discussion of the proposed method are presented for a merchant ship application in a test case voyage through the Northern Atlantic Ocean and compared to the constant speed great circle solution.",

They provide an automated controlling of position and heading of the vessel using its own thrusters to compensate environmental disturbances. The allocation of total required force over the available actuators is a complex task, as DP-systems are over-actuated. Therefore, one of the main challenges faced by the industry is constantly seeking to improve the systems efficiency for both sustainability and economic reasons. Furthermore, it is important to evaluate the performance of a DP vessel under critical conditions. In this paper, the authors aim to compare different thrust allocation logics based on the optimisation of different objective functions. Using a simple validation tool, the authors were able to investigate the overall efficiency of a dynamic positioning propulsion system and its ability to operate when a failure occurs.",

      "abstract": "The aim of the paper is to describe an industry-academic collaboration to conduct a research project whose main goal is the design of a new escort tug family characterized by high intact/damage stability margins, good maneuvering capability and stable behavior during escort indirect assistance. The project is focused on three main research areas: hydrodynamic design and internal subdivision of the hull, simulation of the escort capabilities in different operational scenario, development of control logics that will allow autonomous or unmanned operations. The paper describes the methodological approach adopted for the design and will show some preliminary results. The tug has been designed to be in compliance with new amendments of the 2008 Intact Stability Code (Res. MSC.415(97)) which will enter into force on 1st January 2020) both for towing and for escort operations. Furthermore, a significant step towards enhancement of ship's safety is granted by tug's capability to withstand a damage in accordance with criteria applicable to OSVs. This paper describes the prototype hull and its stability characteristics. CFD calculations and towing tank tests have been performed in order to assess the hull design and to infer simulation models able to describe the behavior of a family of vessels. In particular, the propulsion and maneuverability aspects in escort operations are deeply investigated. Results of the project will form the bases for the conceptual application to a remotely controlled or autonomous escort tug.",

      "abstract": "Rough weather conditions can significantly affect the ship's operational capabilities, in terms of energy efficiency, safety, and comfort on board. With the aim to improve both the ship energy efficiency and the operability, the authors developed a voyage optimization methodology based on real weather forecast maps. This paper presents an overview of the different aspects of the voyage optimization, focusing on the operational implications of the developed method. The routing problem is parameterized in a discrete space-time domain, and the minimum fuel consumption routing solution is selected by means of a dynamic programming optimization algorithm, in compliance with the existing geographical, propulsive and operability constraints. Ship seakeeping and propulsion system is modelled to realistically estimate the propulsion performances and fuel consumption, as well as a number of ship motions-related operability indices, associated with a given sea state and wind condition. Eventually, a case study is shown, and a number of simulations in different operating scenarios are critically discussed.",

      "abstract": "Energy efficiency is a crucial issue in ship management and operation. A proper fuel saving oriented routing strategy can be helpful in reducing running costs and pollutant emissions, as well as increasing the voyage safety and comfort. This paper presents a methodology for ship voyage planning based on 3D dynamic programming. It aims to select the optimum courses and related speed profile for a ship voyage in accordance to a minimum fuel consumption strategy, on the basis of the ship response to wave and wind conditions inferred from weather forecast maps. The ship voyage is parametrized as a multi-stage decision process where the fuel optimization is carried out in a discretized space-time domain and the optimal solution, in relation to the arrival time requirements and motion related constraints, is found by a dynamic programming algorithm which has been developed and implemented by the authors. Simulation trials for a merchant ship sailing different typical routes in the Mediterranean Sea, in a wide range of weather conditions and using high quality weather forecast maps, are presented and discussed. With respect to previous authors’ publications, the presented methodology shows the high potential benefit of detailed weather forecast maps as well as the innovative use of a minimum distance algorithm.",

      "abstract": "Design and optimization of propulsion control strategies is a crucial part of ship design. In fact, propulsion plant behaviour is greatly influenced by the control system dynamics. Acceleration, deceleration, crash stop, heavy turning are some examples of transient conditions that a propulsion plant has to sustain whilst maintaining optimal performance without reducing ship safety and reliability. In this paper, the methodology and the simulation models needed to design the propulsion control logics for an innovative CODLAG propulsion plant are discussed. The methodology is based on the RT-HIL already used by the authors in a previous naval ship project and consists in the development of the propulsion control logics in a virtual environment. In order to increase the reliability of the results new and more detailed ship simulation models have been developed and their validation discussed in the paper. Thanks to this methodology, it is possible to test the control system under different operational conditions off-line, ashore in the office, without any hazards for the real system. The overall design time is reduced and this allows reduction in the time and the related cost of the sea trials for the final commissioning. At the end of this paper, sea trials results are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

      "abstract": "Availability, reliability and economic sustainability of naval propulsion plants are key elements to cope with because maintenance costs represent a large slice of total operational expenses. Depending on the adopted strategy, impact of maintenance on overall expenses can remarkably vary; for example, letting an asset running up until breakdown can lead to unaffordable costs. As a matter of fact, a desideratum is to progress maintenance technology of ship propulsion systems from breakdown or preventive maintenance up to more effective condition-based maintenance approaches. The central idea in condition-based maintenance is to monitor the propulsion equipment by exploiting heterogeneous sensors, enabling diagnosis and, most of all, prognosis of the propulsion system's components and of their potential future failures. The success of condition-based maintenance clearly hinges on the capability of developing effective predictive models; for this purpose, effective use of machine learning methods is proposed in this article. In particular, authors take into consideration an application of condition-based maintenance to gas turbines used for vessel propulsion, where the performance and advantages of exploiting machine learning methods in modeling the degradation of the propulsion plant over time are tested. Experiments, conducted on data generated from a sophisticated simulator of a gas turbine, mounted on a Frigate characterized by a COmbined Diesel eLectric And Gas propulsion plant type, will allow to show the effectiveness of the proposed machine learning approaches and to benchmark them in a realistic maritime application.",

Particular attention is focused on discovering the operational capabilities of the tug in exerting a force on the assisted ship during Escort, and the subsequent great influence that the reaction makes on the tug handling and effectiveness.

Nowadays several hybrid configurations are available and in the preliminary design phase, the selection of the best configuration among several options could be a time-consuming task. Therefore, in this paper, a methodology is proposed, based on the main propulsion design parameters, to identify the global ship energy efficiency in function of the operational profile, considering both design and off-design conditions. In order to validate the method, a sea trial campaign has been done and the records have been analyzed. The developed tool helps, during the design phase, to choose the optimal propulsion configuration, number, type, and size, of the main engines and generators. The methodology is used to compare two design solutions, a conventional diesel propulsion and a proposed full electric plant using a ‘father and son’ power generation.",

      "abstract": "The paper presents a ship weather routing method to minimize fuel consumption starting from meteo-marine forecasting data. For each route segment, fuel oil consumption is evaluated by a steady state model of the propulsion system, taking into account the weather conditions influence on the hull hydrodynamic resistance.Waves and wind data are estimated for each geographical position at every time step, by interpolating into 3-dimensional (i.e. latitude, longitude and time) weather forecasting maps. A 3D dynamic programming code is used to optimize ship route and speed profile, according to minimum fuel consumption criterion. Results and discussion of the proposed method are presented for a merchant ship application.",

Scale model tests have been carried out at the towing tank of Genoa University, taking into account three displacements (full load and two lighter displacements) at five static-trim combinations (even keel, two trim values by bow and other two by stern). The motivations of the research arise from the considered ship type, because these kinds of experimental studies, for the examined hull form, are not readily available in the scientific literature. The experimental results are discussed in the light of the uncertainty analysis to evaluate the reliability of the measured data, to be used for the development of a decision support system aimed at a proper energy management of the full-scale vessel. As case study, the fuel consumption analysis is reported for a defined route, in order to assess the trim importance on the overall ship energy efficiency.",

In this framework, Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM) is becoming key thanks to the enhancing capabilities of monitoring the propulsion equipment by exploiting heterogeneous sensors: this enables diagnosis and prognosis of the propulsion system's components and of their potential future failures. The success of CBM is based on the capability of developing effective predictive models, for which purpose state-of-the-art Machine Learning (ML) methods must be developed. Nevertheless, testing the performance of ML models for CBM purposes is not straightforward, mostly due to the lack of publicly available datasets for benchmarking purposes: thus, we present in this work a new dataset, that will be freely distributed to the community working on ML models for CBM, generated from an accurate simulator of a naval vessel Gas Turbine propulsion plant. The latter is then used for benchmarking the effectiveness of two state-of-the-art ML techniques in the considered maritime domain.",

      "abstract": "The concept phase of the naval ship design process is traditionally based on experience, application of project constraints, rules and experimental information but a key factor is the scenario undertaken by the vessel. The aim of the design is to find a feasible solution with respect to different needs, in particular to the operational requirements depending on missions prescribed for the ship itself. Once requirements are translated in ship characteristics, the application of computational tools is crucial to perform trade-off studies among multiple alternatives in reasonable time. The present paper is focused on the propulsion system selection depending on operational scenarios, analysed through a Ship Synthesis Model (SSM) code, in which the authors specifically developed numerical sub-models to characterize engines (both for propulsion and electrical generation on board) in terms of physical features and fuel consumption estimation. According to the European idea on the Maritime Security Strategy (EUMSS), the maritime surveillance operations assume for the Italian Navy a prominent relevance. In this context, different groups of missions are taken into account and translated into ship configurations, in terms of equipment and capabilities; at last, their feasibility is evaluated through the SSM tool, focusing on the propulsion system.",

      "abstract": "This work presents the main steps for the development of a multi-physic simulation platform, able to represent the dynamics of a twin-screw ship in 6 degrees of freedom, taking into account the complete propulsion system including automation effects. The simulation platform has to be used in the preliminary design phase in order to study and design the propulsion plant and its control system. The ship motion model has been developed including roll motion, in order to capture the ship heel angles during tight turning circles, which may be significant for a fast naval vessel. Moreover, the simulation model includes a simplified representation of the asymmetric behaviour of the two propeller shafts during manoeuvres, which cannot be neglected when dealing with the propulsion plant behaviour. Several sub-models have been developed and calibrated by means of a set of experimental tests, in model and full scale. The sea trial campaign is finally used to validate and tune the developed simulator; thus, the final version may be adopted as an optimization tool for other future designs (or sister ships) and training purposes. Although the presented case study has been validated on a specific ship, most of the discussed models have a general application.",

      "abstract": "The integrated use of modern seakeeping and powering computational techniques and state of the art meteo-marine forecasting and hindcasting resources has the potential of disclosing new ways to approach some relevant issues, such as for instance operations planning at sea, weather routing, in-service ship energy management and pollution control. Such an integrated approach could be profitably used during ship design for optimizing both hydrodynamic and powering characteristics too. In this paper the authors describe preliminary results of a study aimed at estimating the in-service optimal efficiency propulsion plant setting for a ship in real seaways conditions. To this aim numerical simulations of seakeeping and powering conditions of a ship along a real route in the Mediterranean sea have been performed. In the simulations detailed meteo-marine hindcasting data, consisting of wind data and complete directional waves spectra along the route, have been used. Strip theory has been applied for the seakeeping computation in order to evaluate the contribution of waves added resistance in realistic seaways. Such results have been then used in powering computation, to evaluate the dynamically evolving engine conditions in terms of fuel consumption. The results of such computations have been analyzed to evaluate the in-service optimization potentialities for the available setting of propulsion plant. Finally, heuristic hints are preliminarily suggested by the authors as a support for the use of scenario simulations with realistic meteo-marine data in the powering matching phases of the ship design process. © 2014 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",

      "abstract": "Marine propulsion plants are designed to be more and more efficient to minimize fuel consumption and pollution emissions. However, during the ship operating life, propulsion components and hull are characterized by a certain performance decay, responsible for a worse behavior of the overall propulsion plant. For this reason, the several propulsion components are periodically subjected to expensive maintenance works to restore, as far as possible, their original design characteristics. In the present study, the propulsive performance variation of a naval vessel, powered by a gas turbine as part of an innovative CODLAG system, is simulated and analyzed by means of a detailed and validated numerical code. A sensitivity analysis regarding the influence of the main components deterioration (gas turbine, propellers, and ship hull) on the overall behavior of the propulsion plant is carried out. Several speed profiles of the vessel have been analyzed in terms of the usual performance parameters (ship speed, engine power, and fuel consumption) as well as the pollution emissions of the gas turbine. The main aim of the work is to get useful information for the ship management and maintenance scheduling (condition-based maintenance).",

      "abstract": "This article focuses on the mathematical model of the pitch control mechanism for a marine controllable pitch propeller, with the aim of describing the dynamic behaviour of this kind of system and its influence on ship performance. Too great a load on the blades can result in high pressures in the actuating system, response delays and control system problems, which are ultimately responsible for most mechanism failures. The behaviour of the controllable pitch propeller actuating mechanism is considered in terms of blade position, oil pressures inside the controllable pitch propeller hub and magnitudes of the forces acting on the blades. In the proposed mathematical model, the forces acting on the propeller blade are evaluated taking into account the yaw motion of the ship, the propeller speed (including shaft accelerations and decelerations) and the turning of the blade during the pitch change. On the basis of the introduced procedure, a controllable pitch propeller numerical model as part of an overall propulsion and manoeuvrability simulator representing the dynamic behaviour of a twin-screw fast vessel is developed. The aim of this work is to represent the ship propulsion dynamics through time-domain simulation, based on which the designers can develop and test several design options, in order to avoid possible machinery overloads with their consequent failures and to obtain the best possible ship performances. In this aspect, the controllable pitch propeller model is an essential design tool. © IMechE 2013.",

      "abstract": "A comprehensive approach to simulate the interaction between the ship propulsion system and manoeuvrability, during transients and off design conditions, is presented. The increasing attention on the manoeuvring features of the vessel has forced designers to consider this aspect already in the preliminary stages of the project. Data about manoeuvring characteristics may be obtained by means of several model tests (at planar motion mechanism or with free running models). However, differences between model tests and full scale trials exist. From the hydrodynamic point of view, some disagreements are due to the scale effects but also the effect of the propulsion control system, highly non-linear, may provide a considerable contribution to such differences. These dynamical aspects cannot be taken into account with traditional methodologies and purely stationary approaches. For these reasons, the ship dynamic behaviour is evaluated by time domain simulators, developed by the authors, which include the ship dynamics, the propulsion plant dynamics and the propulsion control system logics. At the end of the paper some simulation results are shown in order to better understand the effects and the differences of the propulsion control settings on the ship manoeuvrability in model and full scale.",

      "abstract": "Traditionally, the environmental performance of marine systems in terms of exhaust emissions has never been among the primary concerns of the maritime industry. However, this situation is going to quickly change, as in the shipping sector Energy Efficiency Design and Operation IMO Indexes testify. In such a context it is worth mentioning that the greening of shipping operations can be effectively achieved by a suitable system design and energy management. Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP) should be a tool to monitor and to optimize ship and fleet efficiency performance; as a consequence it will have a deep impact on the reduction not only of the exhaust gas emissions but also of the operational costs. To reach this goal energy modelling represents the keyword. In particular, the estimate by simulation, of onboard power generation, consumption and losses plays a fundamental role for driving, for instance, a decision support tool toward the optimal choices as far as energy management is concerned. To this purpose, in the paper the authors present the outcomes of the activities carried out to develop a simulation tool able to represent an overall ship system from the energetic point of view. Modelling approach and the results of numerical simulations performed by the authors to estimate vessel fuel consumption in a real case study are shown and discussed.",

      "abstract": "Traditional engine-propeller matching techniques are mainly based on nondimensional parameters analysis: Thrust/advance coefficient or torque/advance coefficient ratio are the most used variables to assess the ship propulsion point or to match, at each selected ship speed, the selected propeller with the ship engine. The advantages of this robust and well established procedure (standard propeller open water measures only at some pitch ratios around the design configuration, availability of large databases and extrapolation laws) however, turn into the drawbacks for the inclusion of different constraints and objectives, further than the minimum fuel consumption, in the matching algorithm. On the other hand modern numerical tools and available hardware resources let to partially substitute, in the design stage, experimental campaigns and to collect large amount of information on propeller performances, including cavitation. In this sense numerical computations make out of date approaches just developed to overcome the deficiency of experimental measures. On the basis of these numerical data new algorithms for the engine-propeller matching can be developed capable of investigate different objectives and the influence of different constraints on the traditional optimum points. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group, London, UK.",

      "abstract": "IMO is introducing two different emission indexes for a vessel: The Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) and the Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator (EEOI). The former will be used to assess the design of the vessel, the latter would be used to evaluate the vessel in operation. Both indexes represent the ratio between emissions, in mass of CO2, and the transported cargo quantity per sailed distance. At moment an important debate is focusing on the definition of the 'baseline' values for different ship categories. The collaboration between d'Amico Shipping Company, Registro Italiano Navale and Department of Naval Architecture, Marine Engineering, Electric Engineering of Genoa University provided the framework for a study aimed to evaluate the carbon footprint of the vessels of the D'Amico fleet, the analysis of various aspects of factors effecting the carbon dioxide emissions caused by ships and improvements of fleet energy management techniques. The results of the study can be divided into two main aspects: it is a picture of the actual carbon dioxide emission status of a cargo fleet and it gives the technical instruments and measure tools to start an emission control policy with reference to a ship energy efficiency management plan. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group, London, UK.",

      "abstract": "One of the key issues at early design stage of a high-speed craft is the selection and the performance prediction of the propulsion system because at this stage only few information about the vessel are available. The objective of this work is precisely to provide the designer, in the case of waterjet propelled craft, with a simple and reliable calculation tool, able to predict the waterjet working points in design and off-design conditions, allowing to investigate several propulsive options during the ship design process. In the paper two original dimensionless numerical procedures, one referred to jet units for naval applications and the other more suitable for planing boats, are presented. The first procedure is based on a generalized performance map for mixed flow pumps, derived from the analysis of several waterjet pumps by applying similitude principles of the hydraulic machines. The second approach, validated by some comparisons with current waterjet installations, is based on a complete physical approach, from which a set of non-dimensional waterjet characteristics has been drawn by the authors. The presented application examples show the validity and the degree of accuracy of the proposed methodologies for the performance evaluation of waterjet propulsion systems.

      "abstract": "The paper discusses the deduction of the equations of motion for a vessel with non constant mass and inertia characteristics. In author's knowledge, the topic is not covered in recent marine engineering literature, probably due to the very few possible applications. In fact the problem of a vessel with a variable mass and/or inertia is not common in marine engineering. Classic applications refer to submarines during immersion and emersion manoeuvres. A field of application of wider interest is the simulation of flooding and its influence on the damaged ship stability. Another possible application is the ship motion control by passive water tanks. The authors faced this kind of problem dealing with the simulation of an high speed craft; to assure the static stability at zero speed a large quantity of ballast water is loaded during deceleration and to assure good speed performance it is unloaded during acceleration, producing a rapid change in mass and inertia of the vessel. The paper focusses on the analytical derivation of the \"inertial part\" of the equations of motion, taking explicitly into account the variability of mass and inertia. The aim is to provide the theoretical basis for works concerning the numerical simulation of propulsion and motion for vessels. Among others, two important findings are noticed: • the derived equations, in matrix form, maintain the same structure of the constant mass equations but contain an additional term, • the Kirchhoff's equations hold also for the variable mass case. The derived equations of motion are suitable to be implemented into a simulation code able to represent both 'conventional' constant mass vessels, as well as variable mass/inertia vessels.",

      "abstract": "Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), compared to the traditional marine fossil fuels, has important key advantages as high efficiency, environmental friendliness and economic competitiveness. Unfortunately, up to now, the use of LNG as marine fuel is mainly hampered by the lack of appropriate infrastructures for ships bunkering. During the last ten years, LNG, as a bunker fuel, has been introduced in Norway, a true pioneer in marine gas propulsion. Presently it could be also available for ship bunkering in Italy and in several European countries, usually by a tank truck. In this paper the preliminary design of an ASD (Azimuth Stern Drive) tug, for towing and escorting operations (including fire fighting and oil recovery duties) is illustrated. The vessel is characterized by a hybrid propulsion configuration, combining electric drive and gas engines. In fact, each of the two shaft lines is driven by a single LNG engine (Rolls Royce Bergen 2430 kW @ 1000 rpm) and an electric motor/generator (PTI/PTO) coupled through a dedicated gearbox. In Full Gas Mode, the maximum bollard pull and the maximum speed of the tug are respectively about 735 kN and 14 knots, while only the two electric motors, fed by the electrical power supplied by two Diesel generators, allow a cruise speed of at least 8.5 knots. It will be possible to adopt the MDO fuelled propulsion when the LNG system may be unavailable for any reason or whenever it will appear necessary to save LNG for the heavy duty phases of a service.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays naval vessels are characterised by flexible and complex propulsion systems with powerful prime movers, the most powerful of which is often the gas turbine. The great power available to the propellers entails a careful power management for a safe operation in every propulsive condition, including emergency ship manoeuvres as slam start and crash stop. During these critical situations a very important role is played by the propulsion automation system, which has to manage and control the whole emergency manoeuvre in a safe and efficient way. The paper deals with the description of some proper control logic schemes to manage slam start and crash stop of the new frigates equipped with CODLAG propulsion system. The presented solution is proposed within the cooperation project between Genoa University and Seastema S.p.A., a global ship automation provider, aimed to design and optimise, by numerical simulation techniques, the propulsion control systems. The simulation results are shown and discussed, in order to justify the guidelines followed for the choice of some special control functions, acting during the most critical manoeuvres of the ship.",

      "abstract": "IMO is introducing two different emission indexes for a vessel: the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) and the Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator (EEOI). The former will be used to assess the design of the vessel, the latter would be used to evaluate the vessel in operation. Both indexes represent the ratio between emissions, in mass of CO2, and the transported cargo quantity per sailed distance. At moment an important debate is focusing on the definition of the 'baseline' values for different ship categories. The collaboration between d'Amico Shipping Company, Registro Italiano Navale and Department of Naval Architecture, Marine Engineering, Electric Engineering of Genoa University provided the framework for a study aimed to evaluate the carbon footprint of the vessels of the D'Amico fleet, the analysis of various aspects of factors effecting the carbon dioxide emissions caused by ships and improvements of fleet energy management techniques. The results of the study can be divided into two main aspects: it is a picture of the actual carbon dioxide emission status of a cargo fleet and it gives the technical instruments and measure tools to start an emission control policy with reference to a ship energy efficiency management plan.",

A joint research has been set up in order to deeply investigate the phenomenon, by means of large scale model testing and related numerical simulations.

The behaviour of the ship systems is simulated by means of a numerical model, developed by the authors, which includes the ship dynamics (3 D.O.F. model), the propulsion plant dynamics and the control system dynamics. The presented approach was successfully used for the design of the Italian Aircraft Carrier 'Cavour'. The application presented in this paper concerns the design of the propulsion control system of the new Italian Frigates FREMM. This class of ships has a new propulsion plant concept: the COmbined Diesel eLectric And Gas (CODLAG) type, with single gear and two shaft lines. With respect to the previous applications, the new model is able to capture the unbalance of the shaft lines during a turning manoeuvre. This feature is used to develop a control system able to limit the undesirable consequences of this effect on the shaft line components. © 2010: The Royal Institution of Naval Architects.",

      "abstract": "Design and optimization of the propulsion system is a crucial task of the ship design process. The behaviour of the propulsion system, in transient conditions as well as in steady state, is greatly affected by the capability of the control system to manage the available power and to achieve the desired performance in the shortest time. The selection of a proper control scheme is a trade-off between different and conflicting needs. Two of the opposites are: increasing the ship operability by adding more functions and more controls; and reducing the control system development and installation time and cost. In this paper, the rapid prototyping and testing procedure for the development of the propulsion controller of the new Italian aircraft carrier Cavour is presented, using real-time hardware-in-the-loop (RT-HIL) simulation. The procedure is based on a wide use of simulation technology. First, a complete dynamical model of the ship propulsion plant was developed. Then, batch simulation was used to develop the best possible control scheme. Finally, RT-HIL simulation was used to debug the real controller software and to tune the controller parameters before sea trials. The application of the procedure led to a significant reduction in the development phase of the controller design. Furthermore, the adoption of the RT-HIL technology greatly reduced the time spent to tune the control system during the ship delivery phase. © 2009 IMechE.",

The adopted approach is the following. First the propulsion control system and the propulsion system are prototyped using a simulation model for ship propulsion developed at DINAV. The performances of the ship and its control system are evaluated using non real-time simulation. Then the control system is implemented on the real hardware and tested with RT HIL simulation. RT HIL simulation consists in the real hardware controlle,r which interacts with the ship propulsion models (engine, shaft line, propeller, etc.) that are simulated in real-time. This technique increases the realism of the simulation, providing access to issues not usually available in software-only simulation models, making the test of the new propulsion controller fast, safe and reliable.

      "abstract": "The paper describes an approach used to study the dynamic behaviour of marine propulsion systems. The method consists of three main steps: analytical modelling of the ship propulsion system, stability analysis of the system, and dynamic behaviour of the propulsion plant. The model is based on non-linear first-order differential equations. The concepts of 'geometric non-linear dynamics' are used to highlight some important properties of the model. One of the main advantages of the method is that it enables some important dynamic properties of the propulsion system to be highlighted without solving the differential equations of motion. In particular circumstances an analytical solution of the proposed model is possible; the solution includes the steady state behaviour of the system, which is useful for the engine-propulsion matching. © IMechE 2007.",

      "abstract": "The Department of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering started its activity in 1870 as 'Royal School of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering' with the aim to increase the scientific knowledge of ship designers and ship engineers for both the Italian Navy and the Italian merchant marine. Since that time the teaching and research activities grew up in close relationship with the regional economic maritime sector. Recently the topics related to small ships and pleasure crafts were added to the traditional courses in the new University campus in La Spezia. At the moment the University of Genova offers two degrees of 3 years (BSc), two of 2 years (MSc) and one PhD course in topics related to Marine Technology. The number of students per year is about 550 in Genoa and 150 in La Spezia. The Department has close relationships with Italian and foreign industries, universities, research centres and we believe that the increase of teaching and research partnerships will produce great benefits for the students and also for the organisation. We think that the crucial point to increase relationships is a better knowledge of the education systems of the other EU countries and countries all over the world.

Combustion process of fuels has been examined, highlighting parameters giving malfunctioning and wearing effects. Relationship between characteristics of fuels and damages are quite complex and malfunctions explanations are seldom clear and unique. However, the present work sets an interpretation key of involved phenomena. A sequence of events, linked by cause-effect relationships, is proposed, which is able to explain how the fuel viscosity and some related parameters could wear the engine cylinder liners and cause malfunctions.

Simulation is a powerful design tool that can give the designer insight into the expected performance of the system and is nowadays widely used also in propulsion ship design. The validation of a simulation model is a matter of open discussion. Authors' approach consists of measuring field data during normal ship operations and compares them with simulation results. The availability of field data, useful to test the simulation model, is not common in marine field. The idea of the authors is to link and integrate the ship automation system and the simulation tool. The link and integration process is though to be realised into four steps.

The assessment proposed here aims to quantify the different impacts that merchant and passenger traffic low can induce on the surrounding environment (sea, air, land, etc.) and to compare these impacts with those induced by other transport means. The methodology should be used as a tool during the decision-making process in planning transport systems over a given area.

      "abstract": "This paper describes a methodology to calculate the ultimate longitudinal bending moment of the hull girder and reports comparison between numerical and experimental activities. Suggestions for the use of such an approach for design purposes are also included. The methodology to determine the ultimate limit state of the hull girder is not a well established process; uncertainties originate from the assumptions on loads and loading conditions and on the strength assessment. The paper discusses different approaches for the ultimate collapse computation. The CETENA procedure to assess ship design for the Italian Navy includes calculation of the ultimate bending moment as a requirement of the design process. This methodology can be used to estimate deterministic values of the ultimate bending moment of the ship varying the structural parameters most affected by uncertainties, in order to supply data for a reliability based strength assessment.",
