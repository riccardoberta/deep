      "abstract": "Deep learning models have shown great potential for fault location and classification tasks in distribution systems. Emerging multi-scale data sources such as waveform measurement units, synchro-phasors, smart meters, weather data, and other information from electricity markets provide a rich source of information that can be leveraged for various applications in power system operations. However, the lack of sufficient training datasets poses a significant challenge in effectively training these models to achieve high accuracy and generalization. This paper proposes a novel architecture for the generation of fault datasets from the distribution system and the fault location tasks. It then develops a fault classification solution using graph convolutional neural network that can capture topology information, combined with discrete orthogonal Stockwell's transform for extracting frequency-domain features from time-series data. Pre-processing of the bus voltage angle and magnitude from strategic locations was used. The method was tested to predict faulted buses in the Cigre distribution test system. Comparisons were made with various standard classifiers. The results show the usefulness of the data generation solution for developing fault location models and the benefit of integrating topology data into the classifier with a graph convolutional neural network technique, as it outperforms other techniques in most scenarios.",

A key element of their Building Management System (BMS) is the electrical load forecasting functionality. As numerous techniques have been developed for load forecasting, adaptability has emerged as a fundamental feature of a robust forecasting system, given that no single technique outperforms all others. In this paper, we evaluate a diverse pool of twelve load forecasting techniques for a hourly 24-hour-ahead load forecasting task across four real non-residential building datasets using two Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

      "abstract": "Building energy demand accounts for an important part of global energy consumption and emissions. Load forecasting is a crucial functionality for building management systems (BMSs) in order to optimize the energy supply and use with the goal of achieving economic and environmental benefits. Furthermore, if the building is a sports/event venue (one of the most energy-intensive facility type), load forecasting acquires an even greater importance. This paper presents a new forecasting hybrid technique that combines an ensemble of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) with an AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXternal inputs (ARIMAX) model. The proposed methodology is designed for the 24-hour-ahead electrical consumption forecasting of sports venues. These types of buildings are generally characterized by large fluctuations in their load caused by the hosted events, and therefore they are challenging for forecasting tools. The ANNs ensemble is composed of the average output of several multi-layer perceptrons, while the ARIMAX is used to correct the prediction provided by the ANNs working on the ensemble residual. The proposed approach can be easily implemented within a BMS that can be crucial for an efficient facility management. The hybrid methodology has been tested and validated on the load data of a real football arena. The proposed methodology achieves a MAPE of 9.03 % on an open dataset, and 9.38% on a closed dataset, outperforming standard machine learning techniques, hybridization techniques involving time-series and machine learning methods, as well as a state of the art event venue load forecasting technique. Furthermore, a feature importance study reveals that all the selected inputs are crucial in achieving the result. Finally, the inclusion of results related to an open dataset encourages further studies and comparisons.",

      "abstract": "The use of reversible solid oxide cells within a renewable energy community results a promising application which permits to balance the temporal mismatch between renewable energy production and users’ demand through hydrogen as energy vector. Differently from batteries and supercapacitors, this technology is characterized by a high stored energy density and a negligible daily self-discharge. Nevertheless, the system management is more complex requiring cell behaviour optimization and hydrogen storage control. Here this work proposes a control algorithm for reversible solid oxide cell operation coupled to renewable energy sources within a renewable energy community formed by an aggregation of fifteen residential customers. Based on forecasts of loads and renewable energy production, the proposed algorithm, a stochastic model predictive control, can optimize system operation aiming at economic benefit maximization. The transition between the fuel cell mode for power generation and the electrolysis mode for energy storage through hydrogen production was set considering the available renewable energy, the power demand of community members and the energy sell-back price in order to increase the auto-consumed amount as well as to favour the electricity exchange within the renewable energy community. Since the reversible solid oxide cell is the key-point in such a system, SIMFC-SIMEC (SIMulation of Fuel Cells and Electrolysis Cells), a physically based 2D model, allowed an effective prediction of cell behaviour deriving the efficiency of electricity and hydrogen production from local physicochemical feature and working parameter gradients on each stacked cell plane.",

      "abstract": "Electric Vehicle (EV) charging coordination is gaining more interest for better integrating EV depots into the electrical grid. Several solutions exist, ranging from rule-based control to, more recently, Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques. Batch RL approaches are particularly interesting for their ability to use past data for training the controller. However, such solutions typically work with action space discretization, which does leverage continuous charging set-points of Electric Vehicle Supply Equipments (EVSEs), hindering the scalability of solutions. In this paper, we leverage dual annealing global optimization algorithm to pick continuous actions from a neural network RL agent trained with fitted Q-iteration with synthetic data coming from a custom depot simulator. Results for one year simulation of a 10 EVSEs depot are reported and compared with good results with random policy over several criteria.",

      "abstract": "The efforts toward a sustainable society require the increasing adoption of Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) at all levels of the power grid. Installation of energy storage systems is a key intervention for managing the new security and environmental needs brought by the RESs volatility. This is especially important for transmission networks prone to congestion issues, with critical links between portions of the grid and with a very high capacity of renewable generation, such as the transmission network of Sicily (Italy). This work uses a probabilistic planning methodology for the optimal allocation and sizing of storage systems, previously developed and applied to a real distribution network, also accounting for reactive regulation of voltage by distributed energy resources. The application is implemented in MATLAB/GAMS environment assuming a new wind offshore farm connected to the reinforced grid according to intervention foreseen by the Italian transmission system operator. The result shows the feasibility of application of the methodology to a transmission network, and can be a robust tool for the allocation and sizing of energy storage systems in the considered scenario.",

      "abstract": "The high share of renewables has a significant role in decarbonization targets. However, it increases the intermittency of the power supply and disrupts the optimal operation and grid reliability. This raises the costs for the system and the end-users. To avoid such costs, distributed and dispatchable power generation technologies like small scale combined heat and power systems (CHP) should be promoted to avoid transmission losses and fulfill the energy needs of customers. In this regard, micro gas turbine (MGT) technology can be considered a promising and attractive solution through its environmentally friendly operation and fuel flexibility. Within the scope of this paper, such a solution is proposed as a system consisting of MGTs for CHP purposes to capture the advantage derived from the potential gap between electricity and gas tariff prices for public organizations in Italy. The analyses are based on expected spot power and gas prices traded on the forward markets and actual tariff prices to show the real potential. A specific case study, consisting of 14 buildings of the University of Genoa (UniGe) in Italy has been studied, focusing on using MGTs for CHP as an alternative for the existing energy solution which is electricity and natural gas import from the national grid. A real-time energy monitoring system for the buildings is available at present. The proposed system considers all data points for the consumption and generation capacity of MGTs and optimizes the operational schedule of MGTs based on the electricity and heat demand together with the power and gas prices according to the time zones. Then a comparison is made between the current situation, which is the electricity import from the grid with a variable tariff; and the proposed system, based on net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR), return on investment (ROI), and payback period. Further analysis is performed to demonstrate the opportunities to use hydrogen as an alternative fuel in MGTs and breakeven hydrogen price is calculated to show where it becomes more attractive than natural gas for this case.",

      "abstract": "The microgrids design for remote locations represents one of the most important and critical applications of the microgrid concept. It requires the correct sizing and the proper utilization of the different sources to guarantee the economical feasibility and the reliability of the supply. This study illustrates an efficiency-based power management strategy, designed for an undergoing microgrid project, where the sizing process of the resources (diesel generators, battery energy storage system, and PV plant) is obtained using a mixed-integer optimization algorithm. The proposed power management strategy guarantees the efficient exploitation of the power sources, which is one of the key elements of the optimal sizing process, being naturally included in the definition of the energy cost functions. The effectiveness of the power control strategy is validated by means of quasi-dynamic simulations on the complete microgrid model, where sources are defined by the optimal problem solution, while the cabling (size and length) and the main switchboards location reflect the expected system layout. Results obtained from the simulation of the microgrid electrical system include losses, and allow to verify and to highlight the desired quantities, such as the quality of supply at each busbar (voltage magnitude), and the state of charge of the energy storage system.",

      "abstract": "The increasing penetration of Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) in distribution networks is requiring smarter integration techniques, in order to guarantee secure system operation and grid reinforcement deferral. Distributed resources can contribute to voltage management through Volt/var regulation and, if storage devices are installed, to relieve congestions by leveraging smart control strategies. This work proposes a probabilistic planning formulation for the allocation of storage systems, to be optimally controlled together with other sources available along the grid feeders. The target is to minimize the number of storage modules needed to guarantee technical and quality constraints for all components. The presented approach is implemented in GAMS (General Algebraic Modeling System) and applied to the real distribution grid of Sanremo, Italy.",

On the other hand, specific techniques have to be employed to face the challenges brought by this large amount of data (Big Data). Traditional load modeling methodologies do not use the streams of data generated by AMI, providing static load profiles. In this work, an adaptive streaming algorithm is described to model any load through a Markov Chain. The proposed algorithm is able to cluster the load curves with a minimal computational effort, allowing realtime load modeling. The presented procedure's performance is evaluated by experimental validation and compared with two reference methodologies (Dynamical Clustering and k-Means) in terms of accuracy and computational time.",
