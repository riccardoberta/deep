      "abstract": "Self-righting vessels, usually used for Search and Rescue (SAR) missions, are characterized by specific stability performance enabling the vessel to regain the upright condition, after possible capsizing due to heavy sea conditions. This requires a demanding design process aimed to provide the proper combination of centre of gravity position and geometry features; these last in turn are requested also to fulfil the significant high-speed performance, usually characterizing the SAR vessel operational profile. The resulting hull shape may be an interesting investigation case to be analysed in terms of stability in waves performance. The Second Generation Intact Stability criteria, recently finalized at IMO, provide a robust reference to derive physical modelling and criteria to carry out a stability assessment in this perspective. The paper considers two application cases relevant to real cases of self-righting vessels for maritime safety and protection, with dimensions positioning the vessels in the medium-high size range, with reference to the category, together with a speed of more than 18 knots. Stability failures are going to be investigated with a specific focus on Broaching and Loss of stability in waves; some specific parameters will be selected to put in evidence their influence on the vessel stability in wave behaviour.",

      "abstract": "An amazing technological evolution has characterized the maritime domain in the latest decades, toward a strongly digitized ship, as well as systems and services (energy production and distribution, automation services, connectivity with external assets…). The increment onboard of sensors and actuators, the augmented internal and external ship networking capabilities, the advent of enabling technologies in support of a cloud-oriented approach and the huge pervasiveness of AI create the urgent need of designing an effective ship digital platform, to be considered as a whole with the vessel platform. In the paper, a discussion about the ship digital platform will be proposed, with a high-level perspective, identifying the main functionalities and characteristics. It will be illustrated how the digital platform onboard can support and empower the development and deployment of a ship digital twin, from a life cycle perspective at the functional level.",

      "abstract": "Despite the recognized complexity to estimate the damping influence on ship roll motion, some efficient semi-empirical methodologies have been developed along the years to this purpose. CFD methods, in principle the most appropriate tools to predict roll damping, are not a favorite option in preliminary design at present due to their implications in terms of complexity and computational time. In this paper, an integration of the semi-empirical Ikeda’s simplified method has been formulated with modification of the bilge keels and lift components, following a contribution found in the literature and relevant for Ro–Ro ships. Moreover, with focus on damping evaluation, the second generation intact stability criteria (SGISc) have been investigated: the second-level vulnerability criteria for dead ship condition and parametric roll have been applied to a Ro–Ro passenger ship. Both the consolidated and the new proposed roll damping prediction methods have been implemented in order to appreciate their effects on the final outcome.",

This paradigm shift is emphasized by introduction of Second Generation Intact Stability criteria (SGISC). This paper implements and renders operational techniques, procedures and indications presented in Direct Stability Assessment (DSA) within SGISC, with a particular focus on pre-process of input data for the assessment, post-process of output data using direct counting method and results presentation. The parametric resonance in following and heading irregular sea stability failure mode has been studied using analysis of probability of failure direct counting procedure for the C11 containership. Besides, a sensitivity analysis on relevant design parameters has been undertaken. The post-processing outcomes have been presented and comments about the expected future role of the DSA are given.",

      "abstract": "The shipping sector is required to give a significant contribution to the reduction of Green House Gas (GHG) emissions, according to the ambitious goals fixed by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). To achieve these targets, new technologies and measures are required, related to logistics, digitalization, hydrodynamics, machinery, energy, and aftertreatment. A large potential to reduce GHG emissions is offered by alternative fuels. In this perspective a Well-to-Wake (WtW) approach is due for a comprehensive analysis. The paper is focused on the evaluation of WtW CO<inf>2</inf> equivalent emission factors for LNG, methanol, and ammonia. The extensive bibliographic research on this topic outlines the large differences occurring when considering grey or green fuel production pathways. A case study based on a cruise ship allows to compare alternative fuels produced from fossil or renewable sources, considering two typical cruise profiles. Results in terms of Carbon Intensity Indicator confirms that the WtW approach points out the great potential of alternative green fuels for GHG emissions reduction.",

An appropriate design process, able to foresee in a life cycle perspective, is necessary to properly implement the emergent properties and the capabilities required for the warship in the different operational profiles. This paper will delve into the integration of the Systems Engineering (SE) approach into the realm of naval ship design, fostering an innovative perspective. An integration of the design spiral method with the SE approach will be described, making possible the definition of a hinge between the two realms and depicting a novel comprehensive approach where the ship platform and the so-called payload are finally interconnected with each other.",

The application aims to evaluate their stability performance in a seaway. The assessment is based on two vulnerability levels, and the related criteria rely on the physics of the phenomena under investigation (dead ship condition, excessive acceleration, parametric rolling, pure loss of stability, and surf-riding). At the same time, SGISc provide methodological approaches to consider possible operational limitations related to the geographical area the vessel is meant to sail. Results of the comprehensive analysis carried out for the selected megayacht units are presented in term of limiting KG curves. Outcomes pointed out that inconsistencies among vulnerability levels still exist. Further comments about the relation of the investigated vessel typology and relevant operational profile have been reported. In addition, systematic analysis of the effect of the main design parameter on ship rules compliance has been carried out.",

      "abstract": "Ensuring a widely safe operational profile of naval vessels is one of the leading aspects of the design process. With reference to weather conditions, this kind of vessels often cannot avoid heavy situations to guarantee the continuity and the effectiveness of service. For this reason, an applied research investigation aimed to define guidance in operations is deemed as a worthwhile activity. In particular, the performance in waves under the perspective of intact stability has been considered in this work. The IMO second-generation intact stability criteria have been identified as a suitable tool for these investigations: as a result, there is evidence that operational guidance can be developed for a set of representative naval vessels, following the relevant guidelines. Outcomes have been represented by means of comprehensive polar diagrams addressing the intact stability failures modes. Bearing in mind the actual operational profile, results have been analysed and discussed considering how ship and operating decisions in a seaway condition may affect the performance in terms of ship stability.",

      "abstract": "When dealing with maintenance in ships engine room, the space available around machinery and systems (clearance) plays an important role and may significantly affect the cost of the maintenance intervention. In a first part of a current research study Gualeni et al. (Ship Technol Res, 10.1080/09377255.2021.2020949, 2022), a quantitative relation between the maintenance costs increment due to the clearance reduction is determined, using a Bayesian approach to General Linear Model (GLM), with reference to a single item/component of a larger system Sánchez-Herguedas et al. (Reliability Eng Syst Saf 207: 107394, 2021). This paper represents the second part of the activity and it enforces a systemic view over the whole machinery or system Sanders and Klein (Proc Comput Sci 8:413–419, 2012). The aim is to identify not only the relation between maintenance costs and clearance reduction, but also how the clearance reductions of the single components/items interact and affect the whole system/machinery accessibility and maintainability, meant as relevant emerging properties. The system emerging properties are investigated through the design and application of a Hidden Markov Model Salvatier et al. (Peer J Comput Sci 2: e55, 2016); i.e., the system is modeled by a Markov process with unobservable states. The sequence of states is the maintainability of the system (which incorporates each one of the single components) while the evidence is the increase in cost of maintenance related to the space reduction. By predicting a sequence of states, it is therefore possible to predict the interactions between the system components clearances and determine how the emerging maintainability property is affected by the engine room design.",

      "abstract": "Intact stability represents one of the most important topics when addressing ship safety, and it is ruled by the IMO Intact Stability code, evaluating ship stability in a calm water scenario. However, the interest in ship stability in waves has increased in recent years and this has led to the formulation of the second generation intact stability criteria (SGISc), finalized at IMO in 2020. In this research, an approach to quantitatively and comprehensively evaluate the ship stability performance in waves has been pursued. A methodology is developed with reference to the SGISc. The intact stability in waves index (ISWI) has been proposed, with the aim to become a complementary tool for designers and shipbuilders in the assessment of stability performance in waves. The ISWI represents a comprehensive stability index, able to capture the stability in waves performance of a vessel. The stability index has been verified on a set of megayacht units and its sensitivity to the wave characteristics has been tested, changing the environmental conditions. The outcomes point to a good agreement between the ISWI and the influence of environmental condition changes on the stability performance.",

For this purpose, the committee classified the flooding cases into the trapped air case and vented air case and investigated the flooding process for a simple geometry, using the state equation of air and orifice equation. As a result, the committee concluded that the scale effect is large for the case of trapped air and small vent area. For the other cases, the effect is small and can therefore be neglected in the model test of a damaged ship. In addition, the committee proposed some directions that can be used to reduce the scale effect of air pressure.",

The committee suggested three criteria indicating the concept of how to deal with floodwater and providing clues on what to consider as floodwater when examining damage ships: (1) whether the water is moving with the ship or not, and amount of that water, (2) whether there is a significant pressure jump across the compartment boundary or not, (3) whether the dynamics of water can be solved separately or not. For floodwater inertia, the committee divided this into the partially flooded case and fully flooded case, and investigated the properties and showed how to deal with floodwater inertia for each case. For the case of the floodwater entering ship, the treatment of inertia change due to floodwater was made clear using the momentum change principle. The related procedure was updated reflecting this work.",

      "abstract": "Reducing the human environmental impact is one of the most critical issues nowadays: in this perspective, the progressive decommissioning of fossil fuels is a significant priority to guarantee a sustainable future for the next generations. This paper proposes a zero-emission ferry for inland waterways and short-sea navigation, focusing on realistic solutions to provide the best trade-off between operational performance and environmental sustainability. In particular, the object of this study is the refitting of a double-ended ferry working in the Lago Maggiore, one of the largest Italian lakes. Systems suitable for the purpose have been selected and integrated onboard to maximize efficiency, implementing full-electric propulsion with electric motors, a Li-ion battery storage system, and photo-voltaic panels. The benefits and drawbacks of the considered technologies have been evaluated to select the most promising design solution, focusing on both onboard and on-shore impact in terms of compatibility with the existing infrastructures and considering life-cycle sustainability.",

      "abstract": "The shipping industry is under increasing pressure to comply with new demanding requirements for exhaust gas emissions. Alternative fuels as well as new technologies need to be developed to meet these goals and reduce Green-House Gases (GHG). This paper investigates ammonia as an alternative fuel for the cruise ship market. A focus is given on the regulatory framework (e.g. EU, IMO and Classification Societies) that at present defines requirements for gaseous emissions and design principles of the fuel containment as well as supply systems. Ammonia allows for effective reduction of CO2 but is potentially toxic for human life and the environment. Due to the innovative nature of ammonia as a fuel, the regulatory approach is based mainly on alternative design instead of prescriptive rules. A case-study, with Internal Combustion Engine ICE (Dual-Fuel) and Propulsion Electric Motors (PEM) as selected standard propulsion system, has been carried out to investigate the impacts of ammonia as fuel on a large passenger ship. The purpose is to evaluate the variation of navigation autonomy, arrangement and weights/stability, considering also specific storage and handling requirements.",

      "abstract": "Sailing at snorkel depth is a necessary but dangerous operating scenario for submarines. The main and straightforward reason is that such an operating condition represents a time of possible vulnerability of the vessel. From a design perspective this condition affects the so-called indiscretion rate, that is exactly the ratio between this time of greater vulnerability and the total operating time. Moreover, when the vessel operates at snorkel depths there are some relevant operations that might be accomplished related to both snorkeling, communications and threats detection. These operations are typically carried out by using a certain number of masts, of slightly different shapes and sizes, that might be used in various configurations. The proposed study aims at providing some insights into the unsteady, turbulent, hydrodynamics of several submarine masts configurations. The analysis is carried out in terms of behaviors of the developed free surface, considering the nonlinear interactions rising among the masts considered. The maximum height and length of the breaking wave generated at the bow of each mast is analyzed. Both the near field and the far field unsteady wave patterns are discussed comparing several configurations and focusing on the interaction effects. The computational study is carried out by using an open-source Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamic solver called DualSPHysics, able to exploit the computational acceleration provided by GP-GPU cards.",

      "abstract": "What makes a successful ship design? The most brilliant solution cannot be called a success if it is something that nobody desires. Nonetheless, if a solution can in principle fulfill customer's needs but it is not appropriately executed, it is a failure as well. Therefore, for a successful solution, both elements are crucial: getting the right design and getting the design right. Respectively they answer the question 'what is the right thing to build and why?' and 'how do we build it?'. The traditional design method, represented by the 'design spiral', is a solution-oriented approach that works well when requirements have already been defined. It surely provides a feasible ship possibly fulfilling the customer's requirements, but it is not ascertained a priori that it is the best one from all points of view. The exploration of the problem domain, necessary to select the more appropriate design, can be achieved with a problem-oriented approach such as Systems Engineering (SE) methodology. SE aims is to identify the best possible solution that satisfies customer needs in the most efficient and effective way. In this paper, a new approach that merges the traditional ship design procedure with the Systems Engineering (SE) processes will be discussed, with a special focus on the conceptual integration between the SE V-model and the design spiral. In this perspective, it will be necessary to discuss the definitions of Measures of Performance (MOPs) and Measures of Effectiveness (MOEs). MOEs are related to the achievement of the mission in the intended operational environment, while MOPs characterize the physical attributes of system/subsystems. The aim is to open a discussion within the naval architects community to define an innovative methodology that will support the decisional process in finding the best possible solution, in the specific domain of naval ships.",

      "abstract": "Submarines bring many interesting hydrodynamic challenges that need to be properly addressed to provide precise and reliable information about their performance. Hydrodynamic performance must be evaluated at least in two main operating conditions, namely when it is deeply submerged and at snorkel depth. There are relevant differences in terms of hydrodynamic since the forward speed in the latter condition is typically much lower and of interaction with the free surface. Moreover, submarines used to sail at snorkel depth if they need to accomplish specific tasks, such as communication, that involves the use of surface piercing masts. The proposed study analyses the opportunity provided by different Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) approaches to correctly address submarine performance. The resistance in both conditions, masts free surface hydrodynamics and maneuvering behaviors are addressed. Ad-hoc approaches based on in-house developed numerical procedures and open-source software are presented. Different CFD techniques have been used, including Reynolds Averaged Navire Stokes (RANS), Detached Eddy Simulation (DES) and Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), according to the particular physics that need to be studied.",

Not compliance with a stability criterion cannot be always fixed acting only on the vessel design; also operative considerations are needed in order to reduce the risk level during the navigation. After an introduction to SGISc and rule framework for passenger ships, an application will be carried out. A Ro-Ro pax ferry has been selected as subject of this investigation. Vulnerability levels (i.e. Level 1 and Level 2) are applied in order to assess the compliance of a modern representative Ro-Ro ferry. Moreover, a study about how the environmental conditions may affect the results is undertaken considering different scenario, such as the geographical area or the maximum encountered wave height.",

      "abstract": "When dealing with maintenance in the ship's engine room, the space available around machinery and systems plays an important role. A proper clearance is usually indicated by the system supplier to perform maintenance operations. This space depends on the items dimensions, the kind of intervention and on the human operator, to avoid uncomfortable or dangerous positions. However sometimes the limited space in the engine rooms (as in warships, passenger ships, research vessels) implies critical issues in complying with such ideal clearances. This work aims to develop a tool to define a relation between the maintenance costs increase and the clearance reduction, regarding a single item and/or for the whole system. This tool improves the decision-making process during the design of engine room’s layout, enabling the comparison among different solutions in terms of operational costs. The approach relies on data-driven models and Bayesian inference. The predictive tool, inserted on the Systems Engineering methodology, has been tested on a real case.",

      "abstract": "The sensitivity of ship stability performance in waves to geometric variation has been investigated by means of a simulation-based design framework. The study was devoted to assess the influence of hull geometry variations on some stability failure modes, namely, parametric roll (PR) and pure loss of stability (PLS). The application has been developed by using a representative model of a postpanamax container vessel. PR and PLS phenomena have been investigated by the application of second-generation intact stability criteria (SGISc). The initial multidimensional design space has been filled by 500 design configurations identified by means of a design of experiments approach. A method developed in-house, combining the subdivision surface and free-form deformation approaches, has been used to create the whole set of design alternatives. The generated design configurations have been assessed analyzing the results derived from application of the first- and the second-level SGIS vulnerability criteria for both the selected stability failure modes. To strengthen the correlation behaviors, the design space has then been further explored by using 10k design configurations exploiting the capabilities of a surrogate model–based approximation, relying on a Gaussian process formulation. The study has been focused on the correlations among the variables and the response functions, i.e., the outcomes of the SGIS vulnerability criteria. The significance, in terms of effects, of each geometry shape variable has been investigated. Results have been discussed in the light of the SGISc structure, to provide further insight into this innovative safety framework for a modern approach to intact stability.",

In this relation, we further developed the methods for the estimation of the operational and maintenance costs of a Research Vessel, by using a structured and flexible tool capable of evaluating the investment, operational and maintenance costs for different engine room configurations and of identifying the best solution for elaboration at the design stage (design for maintainability). The engine room space optimisation and accessibility were also evaluated by use of a developed 3D digital mock-up, enabling the assessment of the potential impact on maintenance costs in relation to the clearance space around the machinery and their compliance with specific requirements. After a general introduction to the topic provided in Sect. 5.1 of the chapter, Sect. 5.2 describes the reference vessel used in this Application Case, with a focus on the main characteristics of the propulsion system and electric power generation. Section 5.3, besides an overview of the standard maintenance techniques, describes the implementation of the Mean Time Between Maintenance (MTBM) in the LCPA tool, based on the best working point of an engine. Section 5.4 identifies the alternative solutions for the propulsion layout, proposed with respect to the base configuration, while analysing the obtained LCPA results in terms of economic and environmental Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Finally, Sect. 5.5 presents the results of further investigations on ship design for maintainability by using the digital mockup of a 3D model of the engine room and focusing on accessibility analysis.",

      "abstract": "The focus of the present paper is the development of a resilience framework suitable to be applied in assessing the safety of ship LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) bunkering process. Ship propulsion considering LNG as a possible fuel (with dual fuel marine engines installed on board) has favored important discussions about the LNG supply chain and delivery on board to the ship power plant. Within this context, a resilience methodological approach is outlined, including a case study application, to demonstrate its actual effectiveness. With specific reference to the operative steps for LNG bunkering operations in the maritime field, a dynamic model based on Bayesian inference and MCMC simulations can be built, involving the probability of operational perturbations, together with their updates based on the hard (failures) and soft (process variables deviations) evidence emerging during LNG bunkering operations. The approach developed in this work, based on advanced Markov Models and variational fitting algorithms, has proven to be a useful and flexible tool to study, analyze and verify how much the perturbations of systems and subsystems can be absorbed without leading to failure.",

Operational limitations consist of restrictions to the environmental conditions or geographical area where the vessel may sail. This paper focuses on the operational guidance and limitations as proposed at the 7<sup>th</sup> session of IMO Ship Design and Construction subcommittee. An overview of the current rules concerning the operational aspects of the criteria is given.

      "abstract": "At the beginning of 2020, after a long and demanding process, the Second Generation Intact Stability criteria (SGISc) have been finalized at the 7th session of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) sub-committee on Ship Design and Construction (SDC). At present, SGISc are not mandatory, nevertheless IMO endorses their application in order to assess their consistency and validity. It is envisaged that SGISc can support the design of safer ships, nevertheless such a rules framework might have an impact also on the ship operational aspects in a seaway. In fact, within the SGISc framework, Operational Measures have also been implemented providing guidance and limitations during navigation. After a comprehensive overview about SGISc vulnerability levels and direct stability assessment, this paper provides a specific insight into the methodological approach for the Operational Measures extensively addressed as a complementary action to ship design.",

They are characterized by a significant amount of installed power necessary for the electric propulsion system and hotel services. Distributed power generation seems to be in principle a suitable solution, worth to be investigated, in order to pursue a superior flexibility and reliability, while complying with the applicable requirements for pollution reduction. At the same time, a superior electrical system complexity has to be taken into account as the inevitable downside. This is turn implies that a suitable power control strategy has to be included since the early ship design stage, in order to better capture the advantages of the distributed power generation system. In this paper the complete electrical system model of a cruise shipboard power plant with distributed generation is developed together with a methodology for its control strategy.",

      "abstract": "The residual buoyancy of vessels after damage has a fundamental role in their survivability and it is implemented through adequate ship internal subdivision. Traditionally the number and the position of transverse watertight bulkheads are selected for most ships early in the design phase by means of the “floodable length curve” coupled with the concept of “margin line”. However, for naval vessels, it is more and more common during the acquisition process to explore a wide domain of feasible ships, identified with the assistance of automated processes and assessed also in terms of capabilities, among which is survivability. The generation and the comparison of a considerable number of different ship configurations is very time consuming. Therefore recourse to a parametric expression of the floodable length curve is considered to be a very efficient approach and would thus enable characterisation of the ship, in terms of survivability performance. In this paper such an approach is presented, using an offshore patrol vessel (OPV) as the case study.",

      "abstract": "Cruise ships are among the most complex and demanding products of the shipbuilding industry. The very special “payload” and exclusive operational profile, i.e. passengers looking for leisure and entertainment, imply outstanding performances in terms of safety standards and customer satisfaction. Attention to environment is relevant as well, since these ships are used to operate in spectacular marine ecosystems. The need of European shipyards to continuously progress to preserve the market leadership requires a virtuous evolution of the ship design process projected on a life cycle perspective. In this regard Systems Engineering appears to be a robust and reliable paradigm, able to provide the necessary comprehensive view of the cruise ship system as a whole together with a systematic methodological framework that, among the other advantages, enables the active and constructive participation of all the involved stakeholders in the decision-making process. In particular, Systems Engineering strongly relies on the so-called model-based engineering to share, integrate, combine and improve the level of details relevant to the system under development. In this paper the digital twin model will be discussed as a natural evolution of above-mentioned model-based engineering and its utilization in the shipbuilding field will be described as a very promising application especially in the field of cruise ships.",

The STAMP (System-Theoretic Accident Model and Processes)-based tool named STPA (System Theoretic Process Analysis) consists the following steps: identify system hazards; draw functional control structure; identify unsafe control actions (UCAs); identify accident scenarios; formulate decisions and recommendations. In this paper an approach to model the relations among human operator and automation, based on STPA, will be proposed. An application case will be developed considering a large passenger ship and the specific hazard of dead ship condition (energy black-out). In case of navigation close to the shore and heavy weather condition, this situation can rapidly evolve into a ship loss.",

      "abstract": "Ships are among the most complex systems in the world. The always increasing interest in environmental aspects, the evolution of technologies and the introduction of new rule constraints in the maritime field have compelled the innovation of the ship design approach. At an early design stage, there is the need to compare different design solutions, also in terms of environmental performance, building and operative costs over the whole ship life cycle. In this context, the Life Cycle Performance Assessment (LCPA) tool allows an integrated design approach merging the evaluation of both costs and environmental performances on a comparative basis, among different design solutions. Starting from the first tool release, this work aims to focus on the maintenance of the propulsion system, developing a flexible calculation method for maintenance costs prediction, based on the ship operational profiles and the selected technical solution. After the improvement, the whole LCPA tool has been applied on a research vessel to evaluate, among different propulsion layout solutions, the one with the more advantageous performance in terms of costs during the whole vessel operating life. The identification of the best design solution is strictly dependent on the selection criterion and the point of view of the interested parties using the LCPA tool, e.g., the shipbuilder or the ship-owner.",

      "abstract": "This work proposes a method to model, predict and simulate shipboard electric load power profiles for specific users in order to overcomes the limitations encountered with traditional methods applied at the design phase of the ship. A probabilistic characterization of the user's operating modes is proposed combined with a stochastic process called Hidden Markov Model (HMM) in order to model and simulate the load power profiles. Main inputs for the user's characterization are the initial state π of every user, the state transition probability matrix A<inf>i,j</inf> and, finally, the corresponding emissions at each operating state e<inf>i</inf>. All these inputs can be derived by the traditional information available from the electrical power load analysis (EPLA) or by experimental readings obtained through field measurements performed on-board ships. The method has been applied, tested and validated on a typical on-board laundry service of which experimental readings are available. The simulation of the load power profile shows a significant accuracy if compared with the recorder data (e.g. a mean absolute percentage error equal to the 11.1%).",

      "abstract": "An intense innovation activity is characterizing the energy system solutions on board ships, especially in the case of large passenger ships due to the significant total amount of installed power and the variegate typology of electrical loads. In the paper the solution of a distributed energy system will be considered for a 140.000+ GT cruise ship, in the perspective of a superior performance in terms of safety and energy efficiency. The target is to overcome the traditional concept of power generation based on large diesel Gensets located in few compartments. The innovative proposal is to integrate it, for the hotel needs, with a greater number of power generation units (but of a smaller size), properly distributed on board. For the application, a suitable reference cruise ship vessel will be considered, already characterized by LNG propulsion solution. Number, typology, size and integration on board of the generation units will be defined in relation with aspects of zonal independence, electrical load, weights, volumes, fuel tanks, supply systems, auxiliaries, with the minimum possible impact on commercially valuable space. In this perspective, fuel cells technology will be particularly taken into account.

      "abstract": "In this chapter, the assessment of both the economic and environmental performance of a vessel over its life cycle is addressed, having as a reference approach the Life Cycle Performance Assessment (LCPA) Tool under development in HOLISHIP project. First, on the basis of a literature review, the concepts of life cycle cost and life cycle assessment are briefly recalled. The ideal target is that these two issues shall be integrated and adapted into the ship design process within a circular economy perspective. Then, a separate reference is made to the end of ship’s life phase, explaining the possible strategies to be adopted and highlighting the limitation in estimating energetic and economic performances of this phase in an early design stage. The issue is nevertheless of increasing interest to this regard, as well. A brief review of Codes and Rules related to End-of-Life assessment procedures is also presented. After this, the selection of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) adopted for the LCPA tool is discussed. These KPIs have been divided in two separate categories: environmental and economic. A methodology to compare KPIs for different ship configurations is then proposed, with an attempt to perform an integrated assessment of environmental and economic aspects. Finally, the relation between KPIs and vessel characteristics is presented. Depending on the level of detail available, the calculation of KPIs and its accuracy are varying accordingly. Finally, issues of uncertainty of certain parameters (e.g. fuel price, freight rates) and their effect on the KPIs are briefly addressed, and ways to their consideration are outlined. Results of application of the HOLISHIP LCPA will be presented in the planned Volume II of the HOLISHIP project.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In ship design, since the early stage, there is an increasing need to compare different design solutions analysing ship performances along the whole life-cycle frame, not only from the economical point of view, but also in terms of the environmental aspects. OBJECTIVE: To this aim, an approach is proposed to carry out the assessment of both cost and environmental performances on a comparative basis, among different ship design solutions. METHOD: A blended formulation between Life Cycle Cost (LCC) and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is developed, with the option nevertheless to keep also each selected Key Performance Indicator (KPI) as a separated source of information. RESULTS: Significant KPIs are specifically identified and discussed; then a formulation is proposed for a comprehensive evaluation by means of a single index of Life Cycle Performance Assessment (LCPA). The harmonized formulation allows a rationally based comparison between projects and solutions, giving a weight to each selected KPI according to priorities of designers and ship owners/operators. A Ship Breakdown Structure has been developed to link ship design parameters with calculation of KPIs. Though the end of life is an essential phase to be accounted for in a life cycle evaluation, the practical approach presented in this paper is limited to Design/Construction and Operations. Decommissioning issues have been postponed to a future activity, keeping in mind that the topic is very much related to owners company policy and strongly dependant on details not available yet in the conceptual ship design phase. CONCLUSIONS: The decision-making activity during the ship design process needs to be supported by quantitative evaluations, properly projected over the whole ship lifetime range. In the paper, the structure of a bottom up procedure is proposed, starting from low level information and data (e.g. ship characteristics and operational profile) and arriving to a single parameter (LCPA index), by means of selected KPIs and their linear combination. Indeed, one of the great challenges is the availability and selection of appropriate data, needed to quantify KPIs during the design stage. The approach has been implemented and applied to a Ro-Ro passenger ship in order to verify and validate the LCPA tool structure and its reliability.",

      "abstract": "Recently an increase in electrical power installed on board ships has been revealed, especially for large Cruise ships and All Electric Ships (AES). In this context, the traditional approaches to Electrical Power Load Analysis (EPLA) and generation system size have become inadequate and inaccurate. Aim of this work is to propose an alternative method to perform an EPLA based on a stochastic modelling of loads, which are then combined together with a variant of the Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) in order to calculate the total power demanded. The optimal selection of the generation system size is modelled as a Mixed-Integer Non Linear Problem (MINLP) and solved applying Genetic Algorithms (GA). The results here proposed shown that there is the real opportunity to apply stochastic approach in order to reduce the mission and installation costs of shipboard power systems with significant savings.",

Three stochastic models describe loads that are always \"on\", loads that cycle on and off independently of others and loads that depends on the considered configuration.

In the so-called earlystage design it's advisable a close interaction between client (usually MoDs), designers and experts of naval weapon systems and equipment C4I (Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence). The goal of this project is to develop a tool for a multi-dimensional evaluation of the operational effectiveness of a combatant ship. It is based on experts knowledge elicitation in order to specify, in a structured way, the level of significance of different solutions and possible configurations characterizing a naval unit with respect to the operational scenarios of interest. In this perspective, in the present paper the tool for knowledge elicitation will be described and discussed with specific attention to the ship technical characteristics able to describe consistently the naval unit under investigation in terms of operational capabilities, through the use of systems functional decomposition. A methodology and a tool will be therefore identified with the aim to rationally link the main ship design characteristics to operational effectiveness through systems functions.",

      "abstract": "The European shipbuilding industry is highly specialized in the design and construction of large passenger ships and military vessels. The efforts to maintain the current competitive advantage must increase and develop, in particular by integrating ships with high technological content, with innovative approaches and tools. In the paper an innovative approach is presented to tackle the problem of merging between high level requirements and the ship general characteristics, in the specific field of naval vessel. The goal of the proposed approach is to provide a support system allowing a multi-dimensional evaluation of the operational effectiveness of the naval unit. In particular, the system will allow knowledge mining (knowledge elicitation) from Navy experts in order to specify, the level of significance of alternative devices and configurations characterizing a naval unit. The aim of the project is the definition of a process and the development of a demonstrator prototype, which can support the so-called Strategic Requirements Planning, i.e., the correct specification of the main requirements of the ship. The system will be developed according to the principles of cognitive ergonomics and interface design, in order to provide a seamless and effective interaction between decision makers managing complex pieces of information.",

This way, ship design characteristics are linked to operational aspects.

      "abstract": "In recent years there has been a huge renewed activity in the field of safety regulations, especially for the damage stability assessment of passenger vessels. After the shift from deterministic to probabilistic approach, several urgent matters aroused in naval architects’ minds as well as in those of anyone in charge of safety assessments. One of the possible interesting points of discussion is “How to assess the ship’s damage stability in a preliminary design phase?” In fact, the probabilistic approach for the residual stability evaluation in a damaged situation requires a high level of detail and data which are usually not available in a preliminary design phase. Moreover, even if one had such information, it would be very hard to properly and promptly estimate their complex interaction and influence on the final outcome in terms of stability as well as to evaluate the effects of their possible change in a more advanced design phase. One of the aspects causing a great impact on assessment is the attention to be paid to the fire protection subdivision during the damages definition phase within the probabilistic approach.",

      "abstract": "The accurate prediction of ship resistance in waves is nowadays of increased importance since it greatly influences ship performance regarding sustainable service speed and fuel consumption in seaways. Added resistance is considered as the longitudinal component of the second order mean force acting on a ship in waves and can be calculated from the first order ship motions by integrating the corresponding second-order pressure on the body surface. The purpose of this paper is to present a methodology for the prediction of motions and added resistance by a three dimensional Rankine panel method and to discuss and validate its results by comparing them with experimental data. The prediction in the short wave range, where forces due to wave reflection dominate, has been made applying semi-empirical corrections proposed by Kuroda. Experimental data for the heave, pitch, and added resistance of an ITTC benchmark KRISO container ship have been compared with numerical ones, and the applicability of the proposed method is discussed.",

      "abstract": "The renewable energy targets set by the EU governments is pushing the wind industry toward deeper and further sites, making the floating option the preferred technical and economic choice. Certification authorities are developing new guidelines, recommended practices and standard specific for this industry, starting to recognize the importance, beside the operational phases, of the temporary phases such as sea transport and installation on site (DNV, 2013). The aim of the present work is to propose an approach to analyse the assembly and temporary phases, namely when the turbine is assembled on the floating support structure and the following transport phase from the shipyard to the operational site. After a review of the approaches for industries near to the offshore wind industry, a framework is proposed where criteria, standards and environmental and loading conditions are discussed. Taking the FOWT NOVA as a case study, the proposed framework is focused on semi-submersible FOWT, assessing the design of this floating support structure, highlighting the impact of these rules and evidencing an overall good performance. The proposed approach can be used as a starting point by administrations and certification authorities and as guidelines in the conceptual/preliminary design phases of the design of an FOWT structure. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",

The Stockholm Agreement requires the compliance with deterministic SOLAS 90, with a defined amount of water on deck. SOLAS 2009 is based in the probabilistic approach and it doesn't take into account the ingress of water on Ro-Ro passenger ship car decks. The topic is work programme item for the Sub-Committee on Stability and Load Lines and on Fishing Vessels and several Administrations, included EU, and research groups have been strongly engaged on the issue that is planned to be finalized in the very next future. In this paper, some damage stability investigations for an existing Ro-Ro passenger ship within a modified probabilistic approach are carried out in order to observe the influence on results of the inclining moment due to the presence of water on the garage deck: the residual righting arm after the application of the water on deck effect derived from the deterministic approach is taken into account for the evaluation of the relevant s factor within the present formulation. The investigation is performed applying calculations for different ship configurations, addressing specifically the influence of ship size with special attention to the different residual freeboard values. ©2013: The Royal Institution of Naval Architects.",

      "abstract": "The maritime traffic is the real backbone of the international transport of goods in the world and it is driven by a severe observance of time scheduling. Nevertheless, mainly in relation with the most traveled routes, frequently it might happen that port facilities are congested, and the time schedule for ship load/unload operations is accordingly delayed. In this circumstance the choice is between meeting the original ETA (estimated time of arrival) and then let the ship riding at anchor or slowing down the ship in order to adjust the arrival to the actually needed time window. The latter option is called \"Virtual Arrival\"[l] because it consists of applying a speed reduction that fits the new time for port operations instead of arriving at the original ETA. The purpose of this paper is to investigate to what extent the Virtual Arrival policy could be a valuable option providing a reasonable energy saving for ships. The potential benefits are considerable and they result in direct saving in fuel consumption, reduction of C02 emissions and less congested port areas. © 2013: The Royal Institution of Naval Architects.",

      "abstract": "The more and more severe international standards, the rising cost of fuel and a growing awareness of the environmental impact of pollutant emissions have led energy efficiency to become a topic of great interest in the marine field. The strategy for increasing energy efficiency may refer both to the consumption reduction and to the increase of energy recovery systems. This need turns out in monitoring and control strategies for energy processes on board. Monitoring information is recorded and stocked in a database, that needs to be analyzed to find out patterns in large data sets. A huge amount of data, from a RO-RO Passenger ship, has been analyzed in order to gain a further insight into ship performances. Improvements in ship energy performances cannot be reached without a in-depth study of the historical data of the vessel attitude. Moreover, some general indications are given in relation with the experience gained while managing and observing the huge amount of data involved in this study.",

The assessment of the applicability of an on board Fuel Cell system has been carried on in order to identify the implications in terms of necessary space and therefore the suitable vessel size in which the system could be installed. The investigation has also focussed on the most profitable operational conditions in which the system onboard could be used. The study includes the assessment of different Fuel Cell technologies as well as of different Hydrogen Storage systems in order to find the best compromise that suits the requirements. A technical sizing of the FC system to be installed on-board the ship has been created together with the study of its dynamic performance using as a reference the Nuvera Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cell data. The space for the installation of the FC system and the Hydrogen Storage system has been evaluated. Finally an assessment of the installation technical impact on the ship has been made and a range of possible solutions found. The feasibility of the proposed design has been tested starting from Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) fuelled Mega Yacht concept provided by Fincantieri Shipyard. © 2013: The Royal Institution of Naval Architects.",

The present work, based on a PhD project [1], reports an overview of existing literature on the topic, focussing then on the Lewandowski methodology assessing the dynamic stability of hard chine monohulls; such methodology has been applied to selected hulls belonging to Series 62, in order to assess the sensitivity of the numerical tool and the influence of various geometrical parameters. Moreover, a comparison between dynamic stability results and existing stability regulations, allowed some possible guidelines to be developed for the preliminary design phase in order to avoid transverse stability problems. The study clearly indicates the need for further studies in order to enhance the applied methodology. To this aim, extensive experimental investigations are deemed essential. © 2012 The Royal Institution of Naval Architects.",

The tool is applied to several ship typologies and a special attention in the investigations is given to transversal metacentric height GM and to the maximum righting arm GZmax since, in some proposals, these are the parameters assumed as indicative while performing first and second level vulnerability analysis for pure loss of stability. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group, London, UK.",

      "abstract": "In the latest years an increasing interest in fuel consumption reduction during the operational life of ships has been recorded. A huge effort and continuous pressure are performed by IMO on this matter, due to the involved environmental issues, both in terms of air pollution and in terms of natural resources shortage concerns. Beside the regulatory aspect, it is in the owner's perception of economic advantage to implement as much as possible the several energy saving options that can be introduced in the design phase and in the operational life of a ship. Many promising approaches are on the table and tools based on different methodologies have been recently developed in order to support the decision making process about the most favourable ship condition, from the energy consumption point of view. An important aspect of ship resistance, in a real condition, is the so called \"added resistance\" i.e. the increment of calm water resistance due to the ship advancing in a seaway. This is not a negligible term of the total resistance and it is usually estimated as a percentage (15-20%) of the calm water resistance, independently from the actual environmental condition. In the present paper, by means of a computational tool based on strip theory, a numerical investigation is performed on the added resistance and some comments are given on its dependence on the actual sea-state condition.",

      "abstract": "The design of warships has always represented a challenging field in naval architecture: compared with the design of cargo ships, it is a demanding task, usually of superior complexity. During the latest decades, the design process has known an intense re-engineering course, characterized by the proposal to embark System Engineering principles and methodology. It is assumed that this new approach could be suitable to face challenges of naval ship design, especially when dealing with the modern defence acquisition policy. Systems Engineering is a relatively recent field of engineering: it has arisen to deal with the increasing complexity of systems and projects, their interdisciplinary nature and their need to be tackled on a life-cycle perspective. Furthermore System Engineering helps to enforce a continuous assessment and improvement of the design, in order to ascertain and balance its different performances. In the paper, a reflection is proposed about naval architecture origin and its development along the various scientific paradigms: from its roots in 17th century, to the present System Age. The analysis of naval architecture challenges in the context of System Engineering will be attempted, with reference to the extensive use of Information Technology and Computer Science resources. ©2009: The Royal Institution of Naval Architects.",

As far as oil tankers are concerned, it may be of common perception that a bigger ship represents a greater hazard. In order to gain a possible practical insight about the specific aspect of ship size influence on the relevant environmental impact, a Product, a Panamax, an Aframax and a VLCC have been investigated and compared in terms of oil outflow performance. As measurement tools, the three parameters defined in the IMO probabilistic methodology for the approval of alternative oil tanker designs have been exploited.

      "abstract": "Leisure boats market has constantly grown during the recent years, entailing an increasing need of design tools. This seems particularly urgent for seakeeping and hydrodynamic performance prediction in the field of planing boats. Numerical methodologies are almost consolidated instruments for conventional displacement ships, while some shortcomings are still to be faced and overcome concerning planing craft, due to the high complexity of the hydrodynamic problem. The present paper describes a simplified methodology for the prediction of pitch, heave and roll motions of a planing boat, in regular and irregular waves. In the formulation, a 2D approach is adopted, based on 'momentum theory'; various aspects of the wedge-theory are used in order to model the sectional characteristics, with particular attention to the added mass. A validation of the proposed methodology concerning vertical motions is presented against data available in literature. Copyright © 2008 by ASME.",

      "abstract": "The damage stability criteria for both passenger and cargo ships are going to change from 2009, after finalization of a long and engaging harmonization activity at IMO. Especially in the case of passenger ships, the new probabilistic methodology, significantly different from the present deterministic approach, is likely to concur at modifications of the design procedure, entailing a revision of traditional techniques toward a new perspective, able to embrace such innovative hint. In this paper, some specific issues of the new probabilistic rules will be commented, in the opinion that such standards are an interesting but also extremely challenging resource to perform an appropriate and consistent design of future passenger ships. The radical renewal of such standards, key reference for the ship designer, is an occasion to observe the great impact that current innovation in rule-making philosophy, and possibly in the ship design methodology, can have on the educational path that should be accordingly reviewed and worked out by academic institutions involved in this field, in order to satisfy the requirement of an higher educational profile. © 2007: The Royal Institution of Naval Architects.",

      "abstract": "The rules addressing the safety of life at sea influence and characterize the ship design at an early stage, especially in the case of vessels involved in passengers transportation. In the field of pleasure motor yachts, in particular for those of significant dimensions and intended for the commercial use, the design constraints are prescribed in the \"MCA Code of Practice\". The compliance with the MCA code is appropriate up to twelve passengers onboard. Due to the enlarging phenomena of ship size in this portion of market, the designers are now considering to comply directly with the SOLAS requirements for passenger ships, eliminating at the same time the twelve passengers limitation. To this regard, as far as the subdivision and damage stability requirements are concerned, the new harmonized rules based on the probabilistic approach have been recently finalized at IMO and in the following years are going to substitute those based on the deterministic approach, now existing within the present SOLAS. The significant revision of the regulation implies a strong change in the design procedure and in the definition of possible design solutions. In the present paper, a brief description and comparison of the requirements contained in the three relevant rules (MCA, SOLAS \"deterministic\", SOLAS \"probabilistic\") are given from the subdivision and damage stability criteria point of view, together with an application case, developed for a 73 m motor yacht. © 2006: The Royal Institution of Naval Architects.",
