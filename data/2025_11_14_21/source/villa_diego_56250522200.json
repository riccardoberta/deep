      "abstract": "A software that accurately predicts submarine manoeuvring behaviour is essential for hull, sail and control surfaces design. In this context, the availability of a reliable 6-DOF parametric, modular, and robust model is highly advantageous at early design-stage. The here presented mathematical model is based on strip theory for calculating the linear forces on the bare hull, combined with non-linear cross-flow drag forces. The contribution of control surfaces and the sail are evaluated using a formulation derived from experiments and literature data, allowing to consider the specific geometry of the exposed surfaces and the hull sections on which they are mounted, thus including all mutual interaction effects between the various components, such as the body-wing and wing-body. In this first part of work a comparison between the results of the manoeuvring code and experimental data or other data available in literature is presented, demonstrating satisfactory reliability and robustness with a view to estimating stability and controllability.",

      "abstract": "The assessment for the resistance of a new ship under design can be performed through the Experimental Fluid Dynamics (EFD) or the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) approach; both have their own Uncertainty Assessment (UA). In CFD field, the Verification and Validation (V&V) procedures take into account the approximations for numerical issues and the assumptions adopted to describe the physical phenomena to assess UA. Different theoretical approaches have become available over time; nevertheless, a single comprehensive solution to achieve the UA remains still unknown because as the theoretical methodology varies, the outcome changes. In current work, four different literature approaches will be augmented to perform a V&V analysis for two kinds of model hulls, tested at different speeds and compared with the experimental data. The investigations performed among results lead to the division of all the approaches into the three and four solutions families and to define a robust procedure to identify a reasonable value for the numerical uncertainty assessment. Regarding the robustness and the UA of the approaches, the first family proved successful in only 55% of cases with a UA mean value below 2.01%, while the second one always provides a quantification but with a mean value of 6.65%.",

      "abstract": "Hydrodynamic aspects of autonomous underwater vehicles, even if often underestimated, play a crucial role in the overall vessel design. Over the past few decades, computational fluid dynamics has become a widely used tool for investigating complex hydrodynamic problems in a fast and reliable way, often substituting the most expensive and time-consuming experimental campaigns. Nevertheless, even if several researchers adopt these approaches to investigate some specific aspect (i.e. vehicle resistance, PMM tests, etc.), from an industrial point of view they are rarely used in the vehicle design stages (in particular during the preliminary ones), because of vehicles designs are primary driven by control aspects (i.e. payload arrangements, propulsion layout, etc.). The present paper tries to show possible research fields where these numerical tools can provide a valuable contribution to their design. Different aspects are investigated, ranging from the typical ones, such as the impact of the vehicle geometry on the resistance, to the most complex ones, such as hull-propeller interactions in hovering conditions. This activity demonstrates that a more deep knowledge of these hydrodynamic aspects can better drive the vehicle design, obtaining a more effective and efficient design.",

      "abstract": "An in-depth understanding of submarine control surfaces hydrodynamics during manoeuvring is a crucial step for reliable prediction methods at all design stages. In this paper, a CFD based approach using a viscous RANS code is presented. The use of CFD allows a better understanding of the underlying physics to properly tune a modular framework in the well-known MMG approach, with the aim to better capture the effect and mutual interactions of different hull and sail configurations. The proposed method considers the actual flow around the stern planes interacting with the hull, including the amplification of forces given by the body-wing and wing-body interactions and considers the straightening effects of hull during manoeuvre. This paper tries to overcome the actual lack of available experimental evidences in literature for these topics. The understanding of this phenomenon, rarely considered in literature, is important in terms of design of the depth control system of the submarine while sailing. In the present study, the two standard configurations for stern plane installation are considered, namely cross- and X-planes, highlighting the differences in behaviour and hydrodynamic interaction due to configuration changes.",

      "abstract": "The problem of the so-called dark vessels is a major security issue related to the marine traffic and environment. In this respect, the automatic ship detection from satellite imagery is one of the possible countermeasures in the fight against illegal activities. Technically, such a way of detecting dark vessels mainly relies on the identification of the far field wake released by a hull which might be visible over a significant distance from the hull itself and which might last in the water surface for a reasonable amount of time to be seen by a satellite. However, the shape and the persistence of such a wake field, which includes both the steady wave pattern and the turbulent wake behind the hull, is strongly affected by other phenomena mainly related to the weather conditions, then including the presence of surface wind waves or other patterns on the sea surface. Moreover, there might be unfavorable conditions for the satellite to produce accurate images to be used in this recognition process. This complex situation is faced in a project funded by the Italian Ministry of University and Research called UEIKAP (Unveil and Explore the In-depth Knowledge of earth observation data for maritime Applications) in which an Artificial Intelligence (AI) system for the automatic identification of dark vessels from optical and SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) images is under development. The training of the AI framework is based on both publicly available image datasets and ad-hoc synthetic data. The latter are generated by using Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations on a set of hulls in different operating conditions. The proposed analysis focused on the numerical issues related to the prediction of the far-field wake of a hull in the light of the final purpose of the UEIKAP project. A comparison of two different CFD approaches is shown and discussed in terms of pro and cons of both methods and the obtained results.",

      "abstract": "This work introduces to the field of comparisons between the Experimental Fluid Dynamics (EFD) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The ship resistance prediction can be, nowadays, performed by CFD techniques, but the accuracy of the result obtained is not still well identified. The notable absence of an extensive and freely accessible database, where both ships geometry and experimental data are available, induced the scientific community to organize workshops to investigate both the field of Verification and, most importantly, of the Validation (commonly named: V&V). In this work, through the use of an open-source viscous based code (i.e. OpenFOAMv8), and the availability of a significant experimental database, it has been tested a well-consolidated procedure to perform CFD calculations, with the aim to seed a comparative EFD vs. CFD repository which consists of about one-hundred simulations performed for fifteen different hull shapes. The generated repository has been analysed, in order to extract statistical considerations and assess potential correlations between the differences (among CFD calculations and EFD results) and other physical parameters. The main output of this analysis consists in having defined a mean absolute difference between physical and virtual towing tank tests of 3.2% with a standard deviation of 2.17%.",

In this context, a large effort has been spent in the study of cavitating propeller noise since it represents the dominating noise source on ships. Over the years, the University of Genoa has developed strategies for propeller design by optimisation aimed to the reduction of cavitation and noise as a side effect, limiting possible negative consequences on the propulsion efficiency. In the context of the EU-funded LIFE-PIAQUO project it was possible to perform a complete optimisation activity, starting from a real test case (a small passenger boat operating in Mediterranean marine protected areas) and retrofitting the propellers for dedicated sea trials. The present paper reports the main results of these activities, highlighting the capability of the proposed methods, through a comparative full-scale validation of the outcomes of the design activity.",

      "abstract": "Existing studies and methodologies do not offer designers clear guidelines for selecting optimal catamaran geometric parameters. Most focus on separate geometric characteristics or hull elements to minimize total resistance, providing only general trends that are not applicable when designing hull forms that differ from those in the mentioned studies. In this paper, a methodology is presented to evaluate the total resistance of a catamaran by determining its optimal geometric parameters. The approach involves selecting geometric parameters, defining variation limits to suit the design task, choosing appropriate evaluation methods and analyzing the results to identify the optimal catamaran geometric parameters. The application of the proposed methodology is achieved through the evaluation of different geometric parameters of an existing catamaran, such as its length, demihull separation, and hull symmetry. The CFD software Flow3D 2022 R1 is used to assess the influence of the selected geometric parameters on the total resistance of the catamaran, which is supported by experimental setup verification and validation using model tests. The results are analyzed using the system proposed in the developed methodology, enabling the selection of optimal geometric parameters for the considered catamaran design task. The research highlights the significance of optimizing catamaran hull forms by adjusting demihull spacing, symmetry, and length to achieve improved hydrodynamic performance and resistance reduction for applications during the vessel design stage.",

      "abstract": "The detection of 'dark' ships, vessels operating without Automatic Identification System (AIS) transponders, is a crucial challenge for maritime security and international law enforcement. Traditional methods based on optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery face limitations, particularly in detecting small, fast-moving vessels under complex environmental conditions. The UEIKAP project, funded by the Italian Ministry of University and Research under the Research Projects of National Interest (PRIN), explores a novel approach to ship detection by analyzing their wakes, which provide key information about vessel activity.This paper presents a multi-modal Deep Learning (DL)-based wake detection framework that integrates optical and SAR satellite imagery, AIS data, meteo-marine measurements, and synthetic wake models. The system integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and contextual environmental data to enhance classification accuracy. The first experimental campaign, conducted in the Venice lagoon in July 2024, provided initial validation of the method, confirming the dependency of wake visibility on local meteo-marine conditions. Future campaigns in the Gulfs of Genoa and Naples will further refine the methodology.By combining advanced DL techniques with multidisciplinary data fusion, the UEIKAP project aims to improve maritime domain awareness, offering a robust tool for vessel monitoring and regulatory enforcement. This paper describes the operational planning of the validation campaigns set to take place during Spring-Summer 2025. It also provides a general overview of the project's framework, giving details regarding the processing pipeline, the involved algorithms, the training setup, the data, and some preliminary results.",

      "abstract": "Detecting 'dark' ships, vessels operating without active Automatic Identification System (AIS) transponders or spoofing their signal to evade surveillance, is a critical challenge for maritime surveillance. The UEIKAP project (Unveil and Explore the In-depth Knowledge of Earth Observation data for maritime Applications) provides a new ship detection framework that aims to enhance maritime monitoring by focusing on the detection of wakes, instead of the ship itself. Unlike hull detection, which suffers from issues related to image resolution and is only useful to obtain the instantaneous position of vessels, wake detection provides information about vessel movement, offering insights about its velocity and heading. This project leverages a deep learning-based framework that integrates multiple data sources, including Earth Observation (EO) imagery, meteo-marine measurements, and AIS data. The fusion of such data is used to improve maritime monitoring and ship wake detection. The proposed system architecture comprises multiple modules dedicated to wake detection, including a detection model based on the YOLO family of object detection models and a classification model designed to differentiate between different sea surface phenomena with visible signatures in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery. The functionality of each module is demonstrated through representative examples. Initial results from the UEIKAP system demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting ship wakes under diverse environmental conditions. Performance metrics are analyzed, and the advantages of incorporating meteo-marine data are highlighted. The data fusion approach is shown to enhance maritime domain awareness by improving extraction of the navigational status of vessels and the characterization of the complex sea surface background.",

Steady-state (moving reference frame plus mixing plane interface) and unsteady simulations (sliding meshes) with fully resolved rotor geometry were finally carried out on six selected optimal geometries to validate the optimization process and the performance improvements provided by the RDPJ configuration when compared with the original rim-driven thruster (RDT).",

      "abstract": "Monitoring uncooperative vessels without transponders is of strategical interest both for the civil and military world. Ship detection lacks the ability to discern full situational knowledge of the vessel. However, moving ships generate wakes containing significant information - from current and possibly past position, heading, and speed, to vessel size and hull class. UEIKAP (Unveil and Explore the In-depth Knowledge of earth observation data for maritime Applications) is a project founded by the Italian Ministry of University and Research, and its objective is to develop a deep learning-based solution for wake detection in optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) spaceborne remote imagery. A dataset of real and simulated imagery is under development and will be used to train a landmark-based detection model able to exploit the characteristic features of ship wakes. This is accompanied by an in-depth sea characterization and meteo-marine conditions study, which is used to properly discriminate sea surface clutter for the objects of interest. All the results will be validated by test campaign at sea. This manuscript goes over the different types of data used to obtain the aforementioned contextual knowledge for project UEIKAP, from Automatic Identification System (AIS) data providers to sources of local meteo-marine information. Indications are provided regarding the integration of these inomogeneous data sources with the deep learning-based wake detection architecture. Information on the methods of the first data gathering campaign, held in July 2024 in Venice, is provided, accompanied by observations and preliminary results gathered from the experience.",

      "abstract": "During the early design stage of an underwater vehicle, the correct assessment of its manoeuvrability is a crucial task. Conducting experimental tests still has high costs, especially when dealing with small vehicles characterized by low available budget. In the current investigation, virtual towing tank tests are simulated using the open-source OpenFOAM library in order to assess the reliability of CFD methods for the prediction of hydrodynamic forces and moments. A well-known case study, the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) SUB-OFF model, is used, and the outcomes are compared to the experimental results available in the literature. Five different configurations are investigated for pure drift tests, rudder tests and pure rotation in both vertical and horizontal plane. The results show an overall good agreement with the experimental data with a quite low demanding mesh arrangement of 3M cells, a favourable balance between accuracy and computational time. In more detail, the expected error in the most significant forces during manoeuvres is less than 2% for the fully appended configuration (the submarine real operative condition), whereas the accuracy is moderately reduced for the barehull configuration (a case not representative of a real hull) with an expected error of 15%. A possible reason for the differences observed could be attributed to the description of the two streamwise vortices generated when manoeuvring. Apart from the lateral force and yaw moment, the results of the longitudinal force are also presented, having a greater disparity when compared to the experimental data. Nevertheless, the longitudinal force has no important role for the purpose of making stability and control predictions. The study contributes to the validation and consolidation of CFD methods, offering insights into their accuracy and limitations for practical applications in underwater vehicles.",

      "abstract": "In the context of numerical self-propulsion predictions, the literature on high-speed marine vehicles (HSMV) is still relatively scarce. Actually, extensive numerical analyses are rarely considered for these applications because of the not-so-stringent design constraints and contract requirements concerning these crafts and also thanks to the advantages of series production. On the contrary, with the growth of the market requests, in particular, in the direction of Greenhouse Gas Reduction, the exact knowledge of the vessel working point, in terms of speed and engine configuration, pushes the researchers to investigate all the factors which deeply define the propulsion condition. In the present paper, two existing vessels have been numerically studied using a robust and industrially affordable procedure based on some simplified viscous Computational Fluid Dynamic approaches to predict the self-propulsion working points. The obtained results have been then compared with available sea trials showing a very high agreement even if some uncertainties in both the experimental measurements and the CFD results still exist. The impact of these uncertainties has been further investigated to assess the reliability of the self-propulsion prediction, showing that the maximum speed can be obtained with an uncertainty of about 1 knot and 10% of the corresponding engine load. A more robust prediction can be obtained by including the uncertainty assessment in the propulsion analyses. The validity of the proposed analyses is further supported because the numerical uncertainty falls inside the uncertainty obtained from the available full-scale measurements, so defining a more robust prediction of the vessel propulsion point for design purposes.",

      "abstract": "The “design spiral” of a new ship consists of various milestones, one of them dealing with resistance prediction of the fully appended hull and with the proper placement of appendages, especially in the stern part of the ship where a complex 3D flow grows up. Applying an open-source code, the Open-Source Field Operation And Manipulation (OpenFOAM) one, in this paper it'll be shown a fast numerical, robust and user-friendly procedure for the designers to achieve struts proper alignment rather than rely on a traditional more expensive, both in time and costs, Experimental Fluid Dynamics test campaign. An open-access data of a twin-screw propellers ship, the David Taylor Model Basin (DTMB) 5415, has been here considered to carry out the Fast Procedure. Once the test case has got through the Verification and Validation procedure, different kinds of simulations have been performed to assess that a Double Model simulation with the effects of trim, sinkage and propellers can describe with an adequate degree of accuracy the orientation of the field. It has been possible to carry out this last assessment through the generation of a cloud of points next to the struts position to obtain the orientation of the field and evaluate the difference between simulations. Two substantially hydro-dynamically equivalent approaches have been considered to design new struts in order to minimize their interactions with the hull and other appendages. Through the use of this Fast Procedure, the design time is evaluated equally to a few days, and it can be performed without specific knowledge or huge computational resources and so it can be considered industrially affordable.",

      "abstract": "The objective of the present study is to investigate, by means of velocimetric measurements, the flow field generated by a marine propeller running with inclined shaft. Measurements have been carried out on a scaled model of a propeller in the cavitation tunnel of UNIGE using Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) and the acquired data have been post-processed applying the ensemble average technique. The propeller configuration includes shaft appendages as in a typical twin screw vessel configuration. The tests have been performed also without propeller, considering different velocities, in order to characterize the incoming flow field and analyse possible effects on propeller flow. The complete 3-D flow field has been measured considering four transverse sections at different longitudinal locations, from upstream to downstream of the propeller, focusing on the near field wake. A longitudinal plane containing the propeller shaft has been considered as well. A dedicated interpolation technique is presented to improve the spatial resolution of data and allow advanced analyses. Results allow analysing the main characteristics of the flow field, including the evolution of its main structures. The effects of non uniform inflow conditions caused by the oblique flow are analysed focusing on the dynamics of vortexes and in particular on the trajectories and strength of the vortexes.",

To this aim, a simulation-based design optimization method, combining RANSE analyses (ship resistance) with BEM calculations (unsteady propeller performances) in a simplified optimization process realized through a parametric description of ESD geometries, was employed. Fully resolved RANSE analyses were used to validate the outcomes of this affordable design process, which identifies devices capable of saving energy in the delivered power for this type of challenging test case by up to 2.6%. Comparisons with model-scale calculations, furthermore, permit us to discuss the influence of each appendage in different flowfields (model- and full-scale, as well as under the action of the simplified or the resolved propeller) and the reliability of the full-scale extrapolation methods recently proposed for these types of devices.",

      "abstract": "The employment of twin pod-drives is spreading nowadays through the fleet of modern twin-screw vessels. The adoption of this steering device is of interest for both new-buildings and for retrofit because of the high manoeuvring effectiveness in restricted waters, free-sailing efficiency, hybrid-electric optimal engine control room space optimization and noise-comfort. In terms of manoeuvring, in particular, the control system offers great side-stepping and turning ability. On the other hand, the pod configuration could result in poorer course-keeping and yaw checking abilities at high-speed due to the more open stern shapes, together with the reduced appendages extension. In this respect, the IMO yaw-checking ability, represented by the usual overshoot angles of the zig-zag manoeuvre, should be carefully checked since an early stage. In this work, a simulation tool specifically developed to deal with twin rudder or twin pod ship configurations is described and validated against experimental results. Then, a first application of the tool is shown, presenting the results of a comparative study of spade and flap rudder setups against pod-driven units for a specific group of ships, allowing to show that, in this case, a proper design of pod units is not detrimental of the yaw checking ability.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents the results of the hydrodynamic optimization of a large yacht concept design that is meant to be used as a reference for future buildings. The optimization framework is used to improve the calm water resistance performance of a generic baseline design while satisfying a set of geometrical constraints. The shape of the hull is modified according to a geometrical interpolation approach where two shapes are combined to obtain a third design. The search towards the optimum is driven by a global convergence, multi-objective, genetic algorithm where the resistance of each candidate is evaluated by a Boundary Element Method. The final optimal design is then verified by means of a high-fidelity Reynolds Averaged Navier–Stokes technique, preliminary validated against available experimental data. The obtained results show the strong influence of the stern shape of the hull on the final resistance performance, highlighting the effects of the pressure recovery due to a so-called S-shape bottom. The bow shape is modified consistently to fulfil the geometric constraints and to further improve the resistance performance by inducing a positive interference effect on the generated wave pattern.",

The phenomenon indeed occurs in the case of vessels characterised by loading conditions with low transverse stability — e.g. high centre of mass of container vessels and RoRos. Starting from Kijima's single-screw container vessel evidence, an extension of the study to twin-screw ferry vessels is undertaken, with the scope of quantifying its effect in terms of turning and zig-zag IMO margins at an early design stage. Given the relevant impact, an enlarged captive model testing campaign executed on a sample of reference vessels was analysed to further characterise and extend the concepts to a broader class of modern single and twin-screw vessels, thus motivating the study. As a further result, this analysis allowed to underline the need of a review of the IMO intact stability code when dealing with heeling angle during a turn.",

      "abstract": "The hydrodynamic interaction between two or more ships in harbours or inland waterways is a classical maritime engineering research area. In ship manoeuvring practice, ship masters try to determine the speed and gap limit when a ship is passing or encountering others, particularly in confined water ways. This requires an accurate prediction of the interaction force acting on both ships. The pioneer experimental studies showed that the interaction could lead to a very large yaw moment and this moment is strongly time-dependent, which could make the ships veer from their original courses, leading to collisions. Based on the findings on experimental measurements, some empirical formulas are proposed in the literature to predict such interaction forces. However, these formulas could provide a satisfactory estimation only when the ship speed is quite high, and the water depth is shallow and constant. Numerical simulation overcomes this issue by simulating the ship-to-ship problem by considering the effect of the 3D ship hull, variable water depth and ship speed. Numerical simulation has now become the most widely adopted method to investigate the ship-to-ship problem. In the present study, the development of the methodologies of ship-to-ship problems will be reviewed, and the research gap and challenges will be summarized.",

      "abstract": "The potential impact of underwater radiated noise from maritime operations on marine fauna has become an important issue. The most dominant noise source on a propeller-driven vessel is propeller cavitation, producing both structure-borne and radiated noise, with a broad spectrum that covers a wide range of frequencies. To ensure acceptable noise levels for sustainable shipping, accurate prediction of the noise signature is essential, and procedures able to provide a reliable estimate of propeller cavitation noise are becoming a fundamental tool of the design process. In this work, we investigate the potential of using computationally cheap methods for the prediction of underwater radiated noise from cavitating marine propellers. We compare computational and experimental results on a subset of the Meridian standard propeller series, behind different severities of axial wake, for a total of 432 experiments. The results indicate that the approaches employed can be a convenient solution for noise analysis during the design process.",

      "abstract": "Sailing at snorkel depth is a necessary but dangerous operating scenario for submarines. The main and straightforward reason is that such an operating condition represents a time of possible vulnerability of the vessel. From a design perspective this condition affects the so-called indiscretion rate, that is exactly the ratio between this time of greater vulnerability and the total operating time. Moreover, when the vessel operates at snorkel depths there are some relevant operations that might be accomplished related to both snorkeling, communications and threats detection. These operations are typically carried out by using a certain number of masts, of slightly different shapes and sizes, that might be used in various configurations. The proposed study aims at providing some insights into the unsteady, turbulent, hydrodynamics of several submarine masts configurations. The analysis is carried out in terms of behaviors of the developed free surface, considering the nonlinear interactions rising among the masts considered. The maximum height and length of the breaking wave generated at the bow of each mast is analyzed. Both the near field and the far field unsteady wave patterns are discussed comparing several configurations and focusing on the interaction effects. The computational study is carried out by using an open-source Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamic solver called DualSPHysics, able to exploit the computational acceleration provided by GP-GPU cards.",

      "abstract": "The paper explores the accuracy of a low-cost CFD based approach to evaluate the propeller load variation experienced during manoeuvring conditions. The proposed procedure is based on the inclusion, in the ship hydrodynamic analyses by RANS, of the propeller effect through a body-force approach calibrated on BEM calculation to realize a computationally efficient method. Numerical results have been compared with the literature available experimental data performed on the well-known DTMB5415 benchmark test case, where the thrusts experienced by both of her propellers during dedicated Captive Model Tests were recorded. Both pure drift and pure yaw tests have been considered in the numerical campaign to cover the entire kinematic conditions involved during standard IMO manoeuvres. To prove the effectiveness of the method, also a severe turning circle condition is evaluated. The comparison shows the maturity of these numerical calculations, even if based on a simplified approach, to correctly evaluate the propeller unbalance, opening the way to the application of the proposed method to investigate the causes of load variations in manoeuvre conditions and directly in manoeuvre simulations.",

      "abstract": "Submarines bring many interesting hydrodynamic challenges that need to be properly addressed to provide precise and reliable information about their performance. Hydrodynamic performance must be evaluated at least in two main operating conditions, namely when it is deeply submerged and at snorkel depth. There are relevant differences in terms of hydrodynamic since the forward speed in the latter condition is typically much lower and of interaction with the free surface. Moreover, submarines used to sail at snorkel depth if they need to accomplish specific tasks, such as communication, that involves the use of surface piercing masts. The proposed study analyses the opportunity provided by different Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) approaches to correctly address submarine performance. The resistance in both conditions, masts free surface hydrodynamics and maneuvering behaviors are addressed. Ad-hoc approaches based on in-house developed numerical procedures and open-source software are presented.

      "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to investigate the feasibility of a simple but robust approach for the identification of the main interaction effect of hull and propeller on the rudder inflow in a conventional manoeuvring simulator. The manoeuvring simulator adopts a modular/MMG based approach in which the hull, the rudders and the propellers are described by separate mathematical models which take into account the interaction phenomena. The propeller–rudder interaction factor is examined by means of a numerical model developed in OpenFOAM for the prediction of the performance of a rudder in behind propeller condition. Differently the hull–rudder interaction factor is numerically obtained by means of two different approaches. The proposed kinematic method shows the minimum additional computational cost without loss of accuracy. It is based on the analysis of rudder inflow fields (in a PIV fashioned), therefore It can be carried out in a post-processing phase of CFD simulations adopted to extract the hydrodynamic coefficients. This study validates the method by comparing it with the classical approach also used in the experimental campaign, based on the analysis of rudder forces from virtual captive tests. The approaches demonstrate to improve the overall accuracy of the main manoeuvring parameters with respect to the ones obtained by means of a calibrated semi-empirical model.",

Response surfaces are built using the co-Kriging approximation, i.e. a multi-output Gaussian process that combines large low-fidelity dataset with few, costly, high-fidelity data. The method is applied for the hydrodynamic shape optimization of the E779A propeller using, as fidelity levels, two different physical models for the propeller performances prediction, namely an inviscid, potential based Boundary Element Method (low-fidelity) and a viscous, finite volume RANS solver (high-fidelity). Results demonstrate the feasibility of multi-objective, constrained, design procedures, like those involving marine propellers, using these multi-fidelity response surfaces. At the same time, the need of good correlations between low- and high-fidelity data feeding the response surfaces is highlighted as a requisite for robust and reliable predictions using these approximated methods.",

Depending on the ship type, both onboard comfort and safety represent two key aspects to be taken into account during the ship life. In the present paper, the focus is on the assessment of the safety and comfort in service during navigation in real weather conditions by focusing on an entire route instead of on a single ship. A method for assessing the safety and comfort levels of specific routes is presented and discussed in the paper. In particular, a statistical approach to set up limit thresholds able to quantify the level of navigation safety and comfort for different ship types in a specific area is presented based on historical weather data. The method is based on the Automatic Identification System (AIS) data for the traffic characterization, a strip theory for the seakeeping calculations and historical meteorological data for the environment definition for a specific area in the Mediterranean Sea.",

      "abstract": "The hydrodynamics of surface piercing struts and pile-like structures in general presents some very complex fluid dynamics phenomena that are worth investigating. Among them there are the forward wave pile-up at stagnation, the wave breaking with flow reversal like that observed in Bidone-type hydraulic jumps, flow separation caused by interactions of steep free-surface waves and the turbulent wall boundary layer. Such a type of flow structures plays a key role in several engineering applications, ranging from naval architecture to civil and ocean engineering. The hydrodynamic analysis of different surface-piercing struts in tandem configuration has been done in the framework of a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamic approach available through the open-source software DualSPHysics, developed to exploit the GP-GPU architecture to speed up the computation. A numerical wave tank has been set-up to carry out calm water tests. Beyond the influence of the forward speed, the analysis has focused on the effect of three main geometric parameters establishing the configuration: the longitudinal and the lateral distance among the vertical, surface-piercing, struts and the relative size among them. The mean and the rms values of the unsteady near-field free surface elevation have been analyzed and compared among the selected cases and interaction effects are studied in comparison to the free surface obtained for the equivalent single strut configuration.",

      "abstract": "The problem of predicting a ship's form factor and associated scale effects has been subject to many investigations in recent years. In this study, an attempt is made to investigate whether the form factor is influenced by a change in the ship's speed by numerically modelling a geosim series of the KCS hull form by means of a RANS solver. The turbulence dependence of the problem is also studied by altering the closure model among three widely used approaches (the k-ω, k-ω SST, and k-ε models). The results show that at very low speeds (Froude numbers in the range of 0.02–0.06) the numerical model predicts changes in the form factor of a ship between 10% and 20%, depending on the turbulence model and scale factor choices. As the speed is increased further, the form factor exhibits little change, usually in the range of 1% or less. Simulations where the Reynolds number is changed by approximately two orders of magnitude, achieved by altering the value of viscosity, confirmed that the form factor can be considered Froude-dependent only for low speeds, predicting essentially identical values when high speed cases are considered.",

Built in the OpenFOAM environment, it relies on a Laplace equation that propagates the modifications of the surface boundaries, realized by applying a free-form deformation to a subdivision surface description of the geometry, into the computational volume mesh initially built through a combination of BlockMesh with cfMesh. The feasibility and robustness of this mesh morphing technique, used as a computationally efficient pre-processing tool, is demonstrated in the case of the resistance minimization of the DTC hull. All the hull variations generated within a relatively large design space are efficiently and successfully realized, i.e., without mesh inconsistencies and quality issues, only by deforming the initial mesh of the reference geometry. Coupled with a surrogate model approach, a significant reduction in the calm water resistance, in the extent of 10%, has been achieved in a reasonable computational time.",

      "abstract": "The sensitivity of ship stability performance in waves to geometric variation has been investigated by means of a simulation-based design framework. The study was devoted to assess the influence of hull geometry variations on some stability failure modes, namely, parametric roll (PR) and pure loss of stability (PLS). The application has been developed by using a representative model of a postpanamax container vessel. PR and PLS phenomena have been investigated by the application of second-generation intact stability criteria (SGISc). The initial multidimensional design space has been filled by 500 design configurations identified by means of a design of experiments approach. A method developed in-house, combining the subdivision surface and free-form deformation approaches, has been used to create the whole set of design alternatives. The generated design configurations have been assessed analyzing the results derived from application of the first- and the second-level SGIS vulnerability criteria for both the selected stability failure modes. To strengthen the correlation behaviors, the design space has then been further explored by using 10k design configurations exploiting the capabilities of a surrogate model–based approximation, relying on a Gaussian process formulation. The study has been focused on the correlations among the variables and the response functions, i.e., the outcomes of the SGIS vulnerability criteria. The significance, in terms of effects, of each geometry shape variable has been investigated. Results have been discussed in the light of the SGISc structure, to provide further insight into this innovative safety framework for a modern approach to intact stability.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to assess the quality of the manoeuvre prediction of a twin-shaft naval vessel by means of a time-domain simulator based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) hydrodynamic coefficients. The simulator uses a modular approach in which the hull, rudders, appendices and propellers are based on different mathematical models. The hydrodynamic coefficients of the hull in the bare and appended configurations are computed using virtual captive tests performed with an open-source CFD code: OpenFoam. This paper demonstrates that the application of the CFD hydrodynamic coefficients led to a good estimate of the macroscopic characteristics of the main IMO manoeuvres with respect to the experimental measures. The adopted test case is the DTMB 5415M frigate both with and without appendages. This test case has been investigated in several research studies and international benchmark workshops, such as SIMMAN 2008, SIMMAN 2014 and many CFD workgroups.",

      "abstract": "The intense maritime traffic of modern days requires that a considerable attention be paid toward the comfort of ships not only as design criteria, but also as a means of assessing the quality of navigation in service conditions. Certain passenger routes and ship dimensions are more vulnerable than others to rough weather and the current climate changes require adaptation of design and navigation warning strategies. The main aim of the paper is to describe a method to derive a probabilistic representation of the comfort of passengers and crew on a selected route. AIS data is used to identify and characterise the chosen route. The seakeeping properties of the principal ships are evaluated employing a strip theory code. Detailed wave hindcast data is then employed to build state-of-the-art wave scatter diagrams along the route which allow the calculation of the ship responses for each sea state and the associated probability. The Motion Sickness Incidence is finally used as a comparative measure of the overall on-board comfort experienced on a variety of passenger vessels.",

In this study, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations were conducted to investigate the effect of heterogeneous hull roughness on ship resistance.

The results were compared against existing experimental data and showed a good agreement, suggesting that the CFD approach is valid for predicting the effect of heterogeneous hull roughness on ship resistance. Furthermore, the local distributions of the wall shear stress and roughness Reynolds number on the hull surface were examined to assess the flow characteristics over the heterogeneous hull roughness.",

      "abstract": "The interest in Energy Saving Devices (ESD) has grown significantly during the last years. Recent regulations, like the IMO EEOI (Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator) and EEDI (Energy Efficiency Design Index), impose further restrictions on emissions for both new designs and existing vessels. Moreover, these regulations encourage the development and the application of efficient, unconventional, propulsive solutions to fulfil these new requirements. The paper presents a design approach, based on the paradigm of optimization applied to Propeller Boss Cap Fin (PBCF) energy saving devices for ducted propellers. PBCF, indeed, were extensively studied in the case of conventional propellers, but nowadays there are only very few researches regarding the combination of these devices with unconventional propulsors, such as ducted propellers. Since the particular functioning of propellers inside nozzles can influence significantly the entire flow field aft the propeller, normally exploited by the PBCF for energy losses recovery, ad-hoc design procedures are required. By using a combination of RANSE analyses, a parametric description of the PBCF blade and an optimization algorithm, the paper illustrates the results of the design of PBCFs for propellers operating both in accelerating and decelerating nozzles, discussing the effectiveness of such kind of devices in case of ducted propellers.",

The numerical simulation has been carried out within the framework of potential flow theory by using a three dimensional, linear, Rankine source-based Boundary Element Method (BEM) and a Near-Field approach based on pressure integration for the first-order motions and the second-order longitudinal force prediction, respectively. A preliminary validation and verification study on both a mono-hull and a catamaran is proposed. A systematic analysis of the effect of some relevant operating and geometric parameters on the added resistance performance of a catamaran in waves is presented. Variations of the operating and geometric parameters include the advancing speed, the encounter angles from head to beam waves, the hull static trim and the demi-hulls separation. The trends of the added resistance pseudo-RAO are discussed in the light of the comparison against the reference design condition highlighting possible worse and optimal configurations.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a methodology to develop the control systems of a surface vessel by using both computational fluid dynamics techniques and model-based control design. The model-based control design is supported by a simulation platform where both the ship hydrodynamics and the propulsion plant are modelled together. The application of CFD is related to the direct evaluation of the hull forces in the ship hydrodynamic model, for different manoeuvring conditions. The developed design tool is essential in the preliminary design phase, as a benchmark to test the control algorithms for autonomous ships. The comparison between numerical assessment and regression-based formulae has been performed on non-standard manoeuvres to quantify the difference in thrust allocation from the point of view of control design. Eventually, to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, the results of the sea trials for different manoeuvres are shown.",

      "abstract": "The proper evaluation of the Rudder-Propeller interactions is mandatory to correctly predict the manoeuvring capability of a modern ship, in particular considering the commonly adopted ship layout (rudder often works in the propeller slipstream). Modern Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solvers can provide, not only the performance of the whole system but also an insight into the flow problem. In the present paper, an open-source viscous flow solver has been validated against available literature experimental measurements in different conditions. After an extensive analysis of the numerical influence of the mesh arrangement and the turbulent quantities on the rudder provided forces, the study focused its attention on the forces generated by the rudder varying the propeller loading conditions and the mutual position between the two devices. These analyses give a hint to describe and improve a commonly-used semi-empirical method based on the actuator disk theory. These analyses also demonstrate the ability of these numerical approaches to correctly predict the interaction behaviour in pre-stall conditions with quite reasonable computational requests (proper also for a design stage), giving additional information on the sectional forces distribution along the span-wise rudder direction, useful to further develop a new semi-empirical rudder model.",

      "abstract": "The representation and the variation of hull shapes are two challenging problems in naval architecture due to the complexity of the geometry and to the need to ensure the fairness of the surfaces. Conventional CAD techniques are widely used to accurately describe the hull shape. However, they are rather complex to be easily used to generate hull shape variations due to the great number of variables involved. We propose a study to highlight the pro and cons of the application of space reduction techniques, usually referred to as Reduced Order Models (ROMs), to create a parametric model for both global and local hull shape variations. A geometric transformation relying on the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) method is applied on top of a combined subdivision surface — Free Form Deformation (FFD) approach conceived for modeling and variation of hull shapes. The analysis focuses on highlighting the geometric meaning of the new POD basis functions and on how this model affects the variability of the explored design space. Two studies are developed in order to show possible applications of this technique. In the first one a new set of selection criteria for the POD modes based on geometric considerations are proposed to use it on uncorrelated geometric domains. In the latter the large-dimensional space of the so-called Design Velocities (DV), related to the shape sensitivity, is reduced by using the POD approach to create a new transformation of the hull shape.",

This study is devoted to identifying a proper mathematical model to be included in a dynamic manoeuvring simulator. The hydrodynamic problem is therefore decomposed in the hull and skeg components. The hydrodynamic characteristics of the skeg were so explored by varying its span and chord systematically, allowing deep insight into the physics of both components and their mutual interaction. The distribution of the forces acting on hull and skeg were studied in detail in their dependence from the skeg geometrical characteristics. Suitable mathematical formulations for the skeg forces were implemented in an MMG-like manoeuvring model-based onto the CFD captive simulations. Lastly, the impact on the tug's manoeuvrability of the previously mentioned variations was then investigated. Turning, Zig-Zag, Escort Capability, Escort Mirror ability and Escort Stability manoeuvres were simulated. The results of these manoeuvres are presented, showing the great potential of this manoeuvring model in representing a wider class of Escort tugs.",

      "abstract": "An industrial-academic collaboration between Rosetti Marino shipyard and University of Genoa presided over a deep theoretical and experimental insight into the maneuvering performances of a new escort tug family. The presented z-drive azimuthal stern drive class is characterized by high intact/damage stability margins, good maneuvering capability, and stable behavior during escort indirect assistance. The project addresses three main research areas: hydrodynamic design of the hull with escort capability, simulation of the escort capabilities in different operational scenario, and development of control logics that will allow autonomous or unmanned operations. The tug design concept is supported by a customized simulation tool that enables the evaluation of the free-sailing and towing maneuvering characteristics for Azimuth Stern Drive (ASD) tugs at high-speed (Escort) and low speed (Harbor Assistance) in a real-time environment. The paper describes the methodological approach adopted for the design and maneuvering characterization of such a class, across some preliminary results. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculations and towing tank tests have been performed onto a prototype tug hull in order to assess the hull design and to infer simulation models able to describe the behavior of a family of vessels. In particular, the propulsion and maneuverability aspects in escort operations are deeply investigated.",

      "abstract": "Ducted propellers are unconventional systems that are usually adopted for ship propulsion. These devices have recently been studied with medium-fidelity computational fluid dynamics code (based on the potential flow hypothesis) with promising results. However, these tools, even though they provide a good prediction of the forces and moments generated by the blades and the duct, are not able to provide insight into the flow field characteristics due to their crude flow approximations. On the contrary, modern high-fidelity viscous-based computational fluid dynamics codes could give a better description of the near and far-field flow of these particular devices. In the present paper, forces and the most significant features of the flow field around two ducted propellers are analyzed by means of both experimental and computational fluid dynamics approaches. In particular, accelerating and decelerating ducts are considered, and we demonstrate the ability of the adopted solver to accurately predict the performance and the flow field for both types. These results, in particular for the less-studied decelerating duct, designate CFD as a useful tool for reliable designs.",

      "abstract": "We propose a Simulation-Based Design Optimization (SBDO) approach for the design of an Energy Saving Device (ESD) based on the Wake Equalizing Duct (WED) concept. Pre-Ducts, like Wake Equalizing Ducts, reduce the wake losses, improve the propeller-hull interaction and generate an additional thrust. An integrated design approach, relying on a parametric description of the duct geometry of the WEDs and on a RANSE method, managed by a global convergence optimization algorithm, is developed to maximize the delivered thrust. The Japan Bulk Carrier (JBC) test case, for which model scale experimental data on the effectiveness of the WED are available in the literature, is considered as a baseline. Results obtained by using the adaptive, fully automated proposed design framework highlight significant improvements of the overall propulsive efficiency when the Pre-Duct design is tailored to the actual hull wake shape. In addition, off-design conditions are considered to verify the robustness of the proposed designs with respect to variations of the working point and discuss the opportunity of a robust optimization process.",

      "abstract": "The adoption of RANS techniques is widely spread in terms of resistance and self-propulsion prognosis for merchant and military vessels; however, on the other hand, the captive evaluation of hydrodynamic manoeuvring forces across numerical procedures still concerns great computational effort and challenge. When it comes to deal with Escort or tractor tugs, characterised by rather full hull forms, typical of harbour tugs, with the addition of extensive foiled shaped fore-skegs solutions, the ability of predicting manoeuvring and handling of such vessels becomes a great added value at an early design stage, as an alternative to physical model scale testing, since very scarce data are present in open literature. Escort vessels in particular, both operate at low and high speed, in addition to the typical harbour tasks entailed, making the manoeuvring modelling even more complicated. In present work, a low-speed and high-speed numerical methodology based on the OpenFOAM finite volume method on polyhedral unstructured mesh is investigated and validated against purposely designed model tests carried out in towing tank: Pure yaw, pure drift, drift and yaw, and drift and heel simulation results are compared with experimental data in terms of forces first, and impact on manoeuvring lastly, showing satisfactory agreement with experiments. Finally, Escort capability tests run at tank are compared with a purposely calibrated manoeuvring model on the RANS results.",

      "abstract": "Modern paradigms to design complex engineering systems focus on interactive approaches able to simultaneously handle results from multidisciplinary applications. Keeping this in mind and considering that from a ship design perspective the definition of a hull shape is the first step of the whole design process, a reliable computer aided design model for shape representation and morphing becomes a key feature to navigate trough the design spiral. The proposed research focuses on the comparison of two different approaches to handle hull shape variations, namely the fully parametric model and a non-parametric method relying on the free form deformation technique. The comparison is developed considering both the easiness of building the shape of the reference model with its transformations laws and the resulting number of free design variables. The two methods are analyzed in the light of attainable hull shape variation in two design and modification test cases. The first is limited to the bulbous bow of a conventional hull while the second focuses on the whole surface of a fast, displacement, round-bilge hull.",

The effectiveness of the proposed approach is proven in the case of the INSEAN-E779A propeller, which blade shape is modified to maximise efficiency while reducing suction side cavitation. The 23-dimensions design space defined by the conventional shape representation is reduced by the POD method to 5, 12 and 15 dimensions, retaining up to the 98% of the geometric variance of the original space. A multi-objective optimisation algorithm drives the simulation-based design optimisation (SBDO) process in the new design spaces using BEM for the hydrodynamic predictions. Finally, optimal designs are verified using RANSE to assess the correlation between the performance improvements, the dimensionality reduction and the corresponding geometric variance. The effectiveness of the proposed POD-SBDO framework is discussed with respect to a design by optimisation process relying on the conventional parametric representation of the blade geometry.",

      "abstract": "Achieving a reliable and accurate numerical prediction of the self-propulsion performance of a ship is still an open problem that poses some relevant issues. Several CFD methods, ranging from boundary element methods (BEM) to higher-fidelity viscous Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) based solvers, can be used to accurately analyze the separate problems, i.e. the open water propeller and the hull calm water resistance. However, when the fully-coupled self-propulsion problem is considered, i.e. the hull advancing at uniform speed propelled by its own propulsion system, several complexities rise up. Typical flow simplifications adopted to speed-up the simulations of the single analysis (hull and propeller separately) lose their validity requiring a more complex solver to tackle the fully-coupled problem. The complexity rises up further when considering a maneuver condition. This aspect increases the computational burden and, consequently, the required time which becomes prohibitive in a preliminary ship design stage. The majority of the simplified methods proposed in literature to include propeller effects, without directly solve the propeller flow, in a high-fidelity viscous solver are not able to provide all the commonly required self-propulsion coefficients. In this work, a new method to enrich the results from a body force based approach is proposed and investigated, with the aim to reduce as much as possible the computational burden without losing any useful result. This procedure is tested for validation on the KCS hull form in self-propulsion and maneuver conditions.",

      "abstract": "In the context of the low speed and high drift angles manoeuvres, a limited number of experimental test cases are available in open literature. Consequently, the ability to reliably predict the hull forces (and the related hydrodynamic coefficients) via computational fluid dynamics calculations may represent a significant added value to further tune or to generate new simplified hull forces models to be employed in a manoeuvring code. Even if some applications can be found in the literature for selected cases and conditions, as those considered in the present work, a more systematic comparison is mandatory to confirm the reliability of these numerical approaches. In light of this, in the present work a systematic application of the open-source viscous-based flow solver OpenFOAM to predict forces at low-speed manoeuvring conditions for two ship test cases (the KCS and the KVLCC) is presented. The proposed numerical setup, specifically designed to be applied in the early ship design stage (limiting computational effort), shows a satisfactory accuracy to cope with the strong off-design conditions related to these specific ship operative conditions.",

      "abstract": "A computational framework for hydrodynamic shape optimization of complex ship hull form is proposed and applied to improve the calm water performance of the KRISO Container Ship (KCS). The framework relies on three key features: a novel shape morphing method based on a combination of subdivision surfaces and free form deformations, a robust three dimensional viscous computational fluid dynamic solver based on the openFOAM open-source libraries and a Gaussian process-response surface method (GP-RSM) based on ordinary Kriging model which has been created to speed-up the evaluation of the quantity of interest (QoI) of the design process. The accuracy of the hydrodynamic solver is proven by comparing the obtained results against available experimental measurements. A preliminary sensitivity analysis on the mesh size has been carried out aiming at reducing the computational burden required by the CFD predictions. Three GP-RSMs have been trained relying on increasing number of hull designs. Each surrogate model has been cross-validated by both leave-one-out and k-fold techniques. The behaviours of these multi-dimensional surfaces have been analyzed in details by sampling the investigated design space with 10<sup>7</sup> points according to a Full-Factorial algorithm, highlighting the regions of maximum deviation with respect to the resistance of the reference hull. The three optimum designs provided by the corresponding GP-RSM models have been verified by using high-fidelity CFD simulations with a refined mesh configuration. Calm water resistance, wave patterns and pressure distributions over the selected hull surfaces have been discussed in the light of the generated shape variations.",

      "abstract": "In adverse situations, such as maneuvering and motion in waves, severe variations of the propeller inflow may be experienced, resulting in an increase of propeller thrust and torque and in the generation of in-plane loads. This may cause undesired hull-vibratory loads, stress of the propulsive system and even affect somehow the ship dynamic response. Thus, a reliable prediction of these phenomena during design phases is necessary to comply with the increasingly stringent constraints on safety at sea, propulsive efficiency, vibration and noise pollution. In the present work, the capabilities of a propeller solver based on a potential, boundary element method, routinely used in the optimization process of the propulsive device, to analyze the propeller performance under different maneuvering conditions are considered. After a first validation against uRANS simulations considering a simple oblique flow, the analysis is broadened to a propeller operating in the wake field of a twin screw ship in different maneuvering conditions, for which experimental results from free running tests in model scale are available. The BEM solver is compared also to a steady blade element approach in order to achieve an overview of the respective pros and cons in view of their inclusion in CFD simulations.",

      "abstract": "Propeller optimisation is always the focus of the propeller design process, as such process is aimed at finding the best compromise between often conflicting objectives accounting for many design constraints. The use of optimization algorithms combined with blade shape modification techniques has been proposed by a number of research groups in the past few years and has proved to have a potential for practical applications, but integration in the everyday propeller design process is still beyond to be so consolidated. In the past one and a half year, CETENA, University of Genoa and the Fincantieri’s Naval Vessels Business unit have teamed to set up a propeller optimization software environment to be used by Fincantieri’s propeller designers in their everyday design work. A specification of the optimisation environment was worked out based on an analysis of the current design process, in order for the new procedures and tools to allow continuity of current practices while offering new possibilities in the comparative investigation of design variants and the identification of the very best design solution. The resulting optimisation environment integrates different software tools and consists of three main components linked by JAVA script architecture: a software tool for blade shape modification and definition (1), a BEM code for the evaluation of the propeller performance (2) and the open-source software DAKOTA to guide the optimisation (3). The software suite has been setup such as to be compatible with both Windows and Linux operating systems, in order to take advantage of all available computational resources, from single Windows workstations to the company’s cluster, which operates under Linux. An ad-hoc ‘2D modeler’ has been developed by the University of Genoa to model and modify the propeller design table, while a 3D modeller has been developed by CETENA to generate the 3D propeller description suitable for CFD RANS computations, starting from the 2D propeller design curves. The propeller performance is evaluated using CRS BEM code PROCAL and the CRS Empirical Tip Vortex model. Measures of merit usually include: the propeller efficiency, pressure coefficients at specific locations on the blade back and face sides and, for an hydro-acoustic optimization, also the tip vortex induced pressure. The paper will provide details of the setup of the optimization environment focusing on an industrial application to design by optimization a naval propeller. The specific needs of the final users of the optimization suite will be highlighted and the expected benefits will be discussed, related to the time frame of the design process and the possibility of performing thorough investigations of design variants.",

      "abstract": "The multi-fidelity machine learning framework proposed in this paper leverages a probabilistic approach based on Gaussian Process modeling for the formulation of stochastic response surfaces capable of describing propeller performance for different mission profiles. The proposed multi-fidelity techniques will help coping with the scarcity of high-fidelity measurements by using lower-fidelity numerical predictions. The existing correlation of the multi-fidelity data sets is used to infer high-fidelity measurements from lower fidelity numerical predictions. The probabilistic formulations embedded in Gaussian Process regressions gives the unique opportunity to learn the target functions describing propeller performance at different operating conditions, while quantifying the uncertainty associated to that specific prediction. While the multi-fidelity autoregressive scheme allows to construct high accurate response surfaces using only few experimental data, Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) provides an important metric to asses the quality of the learning process. We demonstrate the capability of the proposed framework to predict the performance of a controllable pitch propeller using few experimental data coming from towing tank experiments and many medium-fidelity predictions obtained using an in-house developed BEM, validated and verified in many previous studies.",

The simplification of the methods is the goal to reach in order to create useful tools for real applications. A new approach for hull shape modification is proposed. It is based on a combination of the Subdivision Surface technique for hull surface modelling and Free Form Deformation for shape variation. The formal relation between the two methods is established by the Free Form Deformation control volume and the Subdivision Surface control polygon, introducing significant simplification to the definition of the transformation. The new approach is described in detail highlighting its benefits. Its effectiveness is finally proved by an example of application on a real hull shape, where a combination of a local and global modification has been analysed.",

Experimental tests were carried out to provide targets for comparisons; in particular, the study regarded the estimate of the deformed configuration (“flying shape” in the sailing field) of a square sail under a uniform flow regime in a wind tunnel facility. Several tests have been carried out at different wind velocities. The sailcloth has been characterized by means of mono-axial tensile tests obtaining Young's and shear moduli as well as Poisson's coefficients, which have then been used as input parameters for numerical analyses. Test results are considered a benchmark target deserving challenging aspects for numerical simulations in spite of the selected simple test geometry and conditions. Numerical tests have been carried out by means of a commercial software (ADINA™). Analyses used a strongly coupled partitioned approach between a Finite Volume Method (FVM) based on Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) equations, whereas a Finite Element Method (FEM) has been adopted for the structural field. A comparison has been eventually carried out assessing different numerical models. A good overall agreement between experimental and numerical results has been obtained by suitably setting FSI simulation algorithms.",

      "abstract": "The study of ship underwater radiated noise is nowadays a topic of great and largely recognized importance. This is due to the fact that in the last decades, the problem of the impact of anthropogenic noise on marine life has been addressed with higher emphasis, giving rise to different efforts aimed to the analysis of its effects on different organisms and, in parallel, to means for the reduction of shipping noise. In this context, attention is focused on the propeller noise, which, in cavitating conditions, may represent the most important noise source of the ship. The propeller noise has been studied for long time with different approaches. One of the most effective approaches is represented by model scale testing in cavitation tunnels or similar facilities. Despite having been adopted for several years, radiated noise experiments in model scale are usually affected by significant scale effects and technical issues. One of these aspects is represented by the correct modelling of the propeller inflow; different techniques are adopted, depending on the facility, in order to reproduce a certain target wake. One of the main problems is to define this target wake, which should in principle coincide with the ship wake; as it is well known, it is usually derived from model scale towing tank measurements, with the necessity for the prediction of the full-scale wake field. Starting from the outcomes of a previous work on the influence of different approaches for the prediction of the full-scale wake field for a single screw ship, in this work, attention is focused on the case of a fast twin screw vessel, analysing the different issues which may be connected to this hull form.",

      "abstract": "Correct evaluation of rudder performance is a key issue in assessing ship maneuverability. This paper presents a simplified approach based on a viscous flow solver to address propeller and rudder interactions. Viscous flow solvers have been applied to this type of problems, but the large computational requests limit (or even prevent) their application at a preliminary ship design stage. Based on this idea, a simplified approach to include the propeller effect in front of the rudder is considered to speed up the solution. Based on the concept of body forces, this approach enables sufficiently fast computation for a preliminary ship design stage, thereby maintaining its reliability. To define the limitations of the proposed procedure, an extensive analysis of the simplified method is performed and the results are compared with experimental data presented in the literature. Initially, the reported results show the capability of the body-force approach to represent the inflow field to the rudder without the full description of the propeller, also with regard to the complex bollard pull condition. Consequently, the rudder forces are satisfactorily predicted at least with regard to the lift force. However, the drag force evaluation is more problematic and causes higher discrepancies. Nevertheless, these discrepancies may be accepted due to their lower influence on the overall ship maneuverability performance.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we present our analysis of the non-cavitating and cavitating unsteady performances of the Potsdam Propeller Test Case (PPTC) in oblique flow. For our calculations, we used the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equation (RANSE) solver from the open-source OpenFOAM libraries. We selected the homogeneous mixture approach to solve for multiphase flow with phase change, using the volume of fluid (VoF) approach to solve the multiphase flow and modeling the mass transfer between vapor and water with the Schnerr-Sauer model. Comparing the model results with the experimental measurements collected during the Second Workshop on Cavitation and Propeller Performance – SMP’15 enabled our assessment of the reliability of the open-source calculations. Comparisons with the numerical data collected during the workshop enabled further analysis of the reliability of different flow solvers from which we produced an overview of recommended guidelines (mesh arrangements and solver setups) for accurate numerical prediction even in off-design conditions. Lastly, we propose a number of calculations using the boundary element method developed at the University of Genoa for assessing the reliability of this dated but still widely adopted approach for design and optimization in the preliminary stages of very demanding test cases.",

      "abstract": "Classic hydrodynamics-related ship design problems can nowadays be approached by CFD viscous solvers. Ship self-propulsion performance prediction represents one of the most interesting problems in this framework. The capabilities of CFD codes to resolve accurately the separate problems (open water propeller performance and hull resistance) have been demonstrated over the last decades. The complexity of the combined problem (and, in turn, the required computational time) has restricted its solution to research applications still far from everyday industrial practice. Some approaches have been developed to reduce the computational burden, based e.g. on simple actuator-disk theory or, recently, on BEM/RANS coupled solvers. In this respect, different approaches exploiting the open-source solver Open-FOAM are presented, focusing on the main self-propulsion parameters. In addition, a new numerical strategy able to provide more information compared to classical simplified approaches, is herein presented and validated against experimental measurements on the well-known Kriso Container Ship (KCS) test case.",

      "abstract": "The effect of laminar to turbulent flow transition plays an important role for the prediction of model scale performance, which is of utmost interest for the development of scaling approaches entirely based on Computational Fluid Dynamics calculations. The recent inclusion of transition models (either based on local correlations, like the γ - Re θ, or on the concept of kinetic laminar energy, like the k - k L - ω) in many RANS codes fosters their application for improving the model scale prediction of propeller performance. In the present work the numerical results using the well-established SST k - ω and the k - k L - ω turbulence models available in OpenFOAM are presented and compared with towing tank experiments for three test case propellers. The influence of turbulence parameters (i.e. turbulence intensity and turbulent viscosity ratio at inlet) is discussed, at first for the ERCOFTAC T3A flat plate validation case, through which useful guidelines for propeller performance predictions using transition sensitive turbulence models are derived. By using these relationships, a significant improvement of numerical predictions of propeller forces is achieved, with discrepancies with respect to model scale measurements appreciably reduced if compared to usual fully turbulent calculations. At the same time the limitations of the adopted transitional model are discussed based on the systematic analyses carried out for three test cases.",

The need for silent and autonomous vehicles moved the attention of scientist in the employment of underwater gliders as well as wave gliders. The reduced dimensions and the relatively easy layout adaptation of such vehicles make them particularly suited for carrying out different missions. Each new maritime unmanned system (MUS) configuration has to be tested in order to characterize the vehicle self-noise and its interaction with the measured data. The low costs and the small dimensions often give the possibility of facing problems with a trial and error approach slightly changing the layout in order to suppress possible noise sources. In the present paper the low-frequency acoustic data, sampled from the hydrophones positioned on a volumetric array in the aft part of the towfish of a waveglider, were not usable due to significant self-noise. To identify the noise source, a systematic analysis of the initial configuration have been carried out in two different phases. At first, the acoustic as well as the motion data coming from sea trials have been processed in order to highlight the critical operative conditions. In the second part, CFD calculations presented in order to identify the unwanted self-noise sources. Finally, a possible improvement is suggested based on numerical CFD calculations.",

The optimization is carried out with multiple purposes: Identify a reliable design strategy necessary to customize the PBCF geometry based on the propeller functioning and evaluate the influence of alternative configurations and of main geometrical parameters in achieving higher efficiency. The use of high-fidelity RANS calculations confirm that the decrease of the hub vortex strength, the reduction of the net torque and the influence of the additional fins on blades performance are the major contributors to the increase of efficiency.

      "abstract": "The aim of the paper is to describe an industrial-academic collaboration whose main goal is the design of a new escort tug family characterized by high intact/damage stability margins, good maneuvering capability and stable behavior during escort indirect assistance. The project addresses three main research areas: hydrodynamic design of the hull with escort capability, simulation of the escort capabilities in different operational scenario, development of control logics that will allow autonomous or unmanned operations. The paper describes the methodological approach adopted for the design and will show some preliminary results. The results refer to the first part of the project. CFD calculations and towing tank tests have been performed onto a prototype tug hull in order to assess the hull design and to infer simulation models able to describe the behavior of a family of vessels. In particular, the propulsion and maneuverability aspects in escort operations are deeply investigated. Results of the project will form the bases for the conceptual application to a remotely controlled or autonomous escort tug.",

The fluid characteristics are computed by using two Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods, namely a Unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (URANSE) method and a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) solver. Based on the CFD results, the structure response is calculated by means of a Finite Element Method (FEM).

We focus on a 3D test case in which we evaluated the sensitivity of several input parameters on the fluid and structural results. In particular, this analysis provides a starting point from which we can look deeper into specific aspects of these simulations and analyze more realistic cases, e.g., in sails design. In this study, using the commercial software ADINA<sup>™</sup>, we addressed a well-known unsteadiness problem comprising a square box representing the fluid domain with a flexible bottom modeled with structural shell elements. We compared data from previously published work whose authors used the same numerical approach, i.e., a partitioned approach coupling a finite volume solver (for the fluid domain) and a finite element solver (for the solid domain). Specifically, we established several benchmarks and made comparisons with respect to fluid and solid meshes, structural element types, and structural damping, as well as solution algorithms. Moreover, we compared our method with a monolithic finite element solution method. Our comparisons of new and old results provide an outline of best practices for such simulations.",

      "abstract": "Marine propellers design requirements are always more pressing and the application of unusual propulsive configurations, like ducted propellers with decelerating nozzles, may represent a valuable alternative to fulfill stringent design constraints. Accelerating duct configurations were realized mainly to increase the propeller efficiency in the case of highly-loaded functioning. The use of decelerating nozzles sustains the postponing of the cavitating phenomena that, in turn, reflects into a reduction of vibrations and radiated noise. The design of decelerating nozzle, unfortunately, is still challenging. The complex interaction between the propeller and the nozzle, both in terms of global flow feature and local (tip located) phenomena, is not yet fully understood. No extensive systematic series, as in the case of accelerating configurations, are available and the design still relies on few measurements and data. On the other hand, viscous flow solvers appear as reliable and accurate tools for the prediction of complex flow fields and their application for the calculation of ducted propeller performance and nozzle flow was almost successful. Hence, using CFD as a part of a design procedure based on optimization, by combining a parametric description of the geometry, a RANSE solver (OpenFOAM) and a genetic type algorithm (the modeFrontier optimization environment), is the obvious step towards an even more reliable ducted propeller design. An actuator disk model is adopted to include efficiently the influence of the propeller on the flow around the duct; this allows avoiding the weighting of the computational effort that is necessary for the calculations of the thousands of geometries needed for the indirect design by optimization. Design improvements, in model scale, are measured by comparing, by means of dedicated fully resolved RANSE calculations, the performance of the optimized geometries with those of conventional shapes available in literature. For both nozzle typologies, dedicated shapes reducing the risk of cavitation and increasing the delivered thrust are obtained, showing the opportunity of customized nozzle design out of usual systematic series. In addition, by analyzing the results of the optimization histories, appropriate design criteria are derived for both accelerating and decelerating nozzle shapes.",

      "abstract": "The paper deals with the self-propulsion problem, i.e. the solution of the flow around the hull that advances at uniform speed due to the action of its own propeller. A coupled BEM/RANS approach, previously proposed for a simpler case with only rudder and propeller, has been extensively analysed to highlight the strength and the weakness of the method. The proposed analyses consider the influence of different turbulence modelling, the role of the interpolating algorithm for the inclusion of body forces into the RANS domain, a mesh and simulation time step sensitivity study and the influence of the extrapolation procedure for the definition of the effective wake to the propeller in the light of the lightest and the most affordable computational setup for daily accurate calculations. At first, the well-known Kriso Container Ship (KCS) test case is considered. This ship has been widely investigated in the context of different research projects and a large amount of data (both measurements and numerical calculations) is available to validate the solution approach and to highlight the benefits, as well as the weaknesses, of the proposed coupled BEM/RANS approach versus established but computationally demanding calculations based only on RANS simulations. Once the approach has been developed and validated via the KCS test case, calculations have been repeated in the case of completely different ships, in order to evaluate its general applicability and to test the robustness and the reliability of the proposed procedure.",

      "abstract": "Accurate and reliable numerical predictions of propeller performance are a fundamental aspect for any analysis and design of a modern propeller. Prediction of cavitation and of cavity extension is another important task, since cavitation is one of the crucial aspects that influences efficiency in addition to propagated noise and blade vibration and erosion. The validation of the numerical tools that support the design process, including open-source codes, is, consequently, essential. The public availability of measurements and observations which cover not only usual thrust and torque in open water conditions (including cavitation) but also unsteady functioning with pressure pulse measurements in the case of the Potsdam Propeller Test Case certainly represents an extremely useful source of information and an excellent chance for verification and validation purposes. In the present work, the prediction of the Potsdam Propeller Test Case propeller performance using the OpenFOAM computational fluid dynamics package is proposed. After a preliminary validation and calibration of the OpenFOAM native Schnerr-Sauer interphase mass transfer model for cavitating flow, based on the experimental results on a 2D NACA66Mod hydrofoil, open water propeller performance and cavitation predictions are carried out. The OpenFOAM results are finally compared both with the available experimental measurements and with calculations carried out with StarCCM+ and with a proprietary boundary element method code, in order to assess the accuracy and the overall capabilities of the open-source tools (from meshing to post-processing) available in the OpenFOAM package. The comparison, in addition to assessing the accuracy of the open-source approach, is aimed to verify its advantages and drawbacks with respect to widely used solvers and to further verify the reliability of traditional boundary element method approaches that are still widely adopted for design and optimization (thanks to their extremely higher computational efficiency) in a very demanding test case.",

      "abstract": "The design of a propeller for a high-speed craft is addressed by using a multi-objective numerical optimization approach. By combining a fast and reliable Boundary Elements Method (BEM), a viscous flow solver based on the RANSE approximation, a parametric 3D description of the blade and a genetic algorithm, the new propeller shape is designed to improve the propulsive efficiency, reduce the cavitation extension, increase the cavitation inception speed and maximize, at the same time, the ship speed. Rather than by constraining the propeller delivered thrust, indeed, the proposed procedure works together with an engine-propeller matching algorithm that, each time a new propeller is defined, identifies the achievable maximum ship speed and the resulting engine functioning point that turn in additional goals for the multi-objective optimization. A set of optimal propellers, obtained through the design by optimization based on potential flow calculations (via the Boundary Elements Method), are selected for additional viscous analyses (RANSE calculations) in order to further validate the results of the BEM calculations and provide a deeper insight into the complex flow fields of high speed propellers. Among this subset of optimal configurations, a final geometry is selected to verify the reliability of the design procedure by means of dedicated cavitation tunnel tests and full-scale measurements on a high-speed craft provided by Azimut|Benetti.",

      "abstract": "The state of the art of fast propeller design codes is mainly based on classical vortical theories by Lerbs. Their crude simplifications make them often insufficiently accurate in the case of modern fast propellers geometries having highly skewed blades, non-conventional profiles, mixed type of cavitation and strict constraints about pressure pulses and radiated noise. Advanced design tools, based on (more) accurate flow solvers able to deal with the multi-objective nature of any modern design are, definitely, required. In light of this, the design of a propeller for a high-speed craft is addressed by using a multi-objective numerical optimization approach, based on a fast and reliable BEM, a parametric description of the geometry and a genetic algorithm.

      "abstract": "Marine propellers design requirements are always more pressing and the application of unusual propulsive configurations, like ducted propellers with decelerating nozzles, may represent a valuable alternative to fulfil stringent design constraints. If accelerating duct configurations were realized mainly to increase the propeller efficiency in highly-loaded conditions, decelerating nozzles sustains the postponing of the cavitating phenomena that reflects into reduction of vibrations and radiated noise. The design of decelerating nozzle, unfortunately, is still challenging. No extensive systematic series are available and the design relies on few measurements. On the other hand, viscous flow solvers appear as reliable and accurate tools for the prediction of complex flow fields. Hence, in the present paper the opportunity to use CFD as a part of a design procedure based on optimization, by combining a parametric description of the geometry, the OpenFOAM solver and a genetic type algorithm in the ModeFrontier environment, is investigated. Design improvements for both accelerating and decelerating ducts are measured by comparing the performance of the optimized geometries with those of conventional shapes available in literature.",

In both cases open-source software have been chosen. The numerical solutions from the two proposed CFD methods are verified against experimental measurements. The systematic analysis is performed considering a prescribed motion of the wedge aiming to a better understanding of the effect of the model set-up on the prediction of both local and global field variables. Even if a both codes shows a high ability to capture the global physics of the problem, due to the strongly nonlinear dynamic of the body-flow interactions involved in impact problems, the local pressure peaks can be hardly predicted if the numerical method is not suitably tuned for the specific problem. Finally the two approaches are performed also for a free falling simulation, comparing the numerical predictions to the available experimental drop tests results.",

      "abstract": "The present paper is focused on an experimental investigation of pressure pulses and radiated noise for two alternative designs of a propeller of a high-speed craft. The propellers have been designed in the context of a research project starting from two different rake distributions (forward rake to increase thrust and efficiency, backward rake to reduce cavitation), using different techniques (traditional lifting line / lifting surface and optimization algorithm coupled with a panel code), leading thus to rather different geometries. Propellers have been tested through cavitation tunnel experiments. The activity represents an interesting case study for this kind of measurement in presence of rather large cavitation extensions. The effects of cavitation on different components of pressure pulses and noise are investigated for the different rake distributions adopted. Results clearly shows the effects of this geometrical characteristic on cavitation and pressure pulses pointing out that, in some cases, propeller hydrodynamic performances may determine pressure pulses intensity more than cavitation extensions. A simplified numerical approach, adopting stationary RANS calculations, for the evaluation of the effects of propeller geometry, has been proposed. Results show a good correlation with measurements allowing to have an insight into the phenomenon and confirming the effect of the rake.",

The tool is based on combining the strip-theory programme PDSTRIP with the WavewatchIII operational model run at DICCA, University of Genoa, to assess safety, efficiency and comfort parameters of vessels and assist in route selection and optimisation. In this paper, the focus is on analysing the effect of parametric versus full wave spectra on the response of the vessel and the consequent route selection. The influence of the wave spectrum is demonstrated initially for an example sea-state localised in Eastern Liguria, and subsequently for a route from Genoa, Italy to Tangier, Morocco, with three predetermined route variations. A typical passenger ferry is considered with an operational ship speed of 15 kn, corresponding to a Froude number of 0.22. It is shown that using standard parametric formulations for the wave spectrum versus the full (numerically forecasted) directional spectrum can affect the route evaluation and potentially lead to a different optimum route choice.",

      "abstract": "The present paper deals with the side effects of propellers cavitation, i.e. pressure pulses and radiated noise. These effects are gaining more and more importance for commercial ships for different reasons. Pressure pulses significantly affect comfort onboard, thus their reduction is of utmost importance for all ships carrying passengers. As regards the underwater radiated noise, in the last decade interest has shifted from navy applications to commercial ships, due to the concern for the rising background noise in the oceans. The propellers, generating noise directly in water, represent one of the main contributions to the overall underwater noise emitted from ships. Due to the complexity of the mechanisms of propeller noise generation, different complementary strategies have to be followed to properly analyze the problem, ranging from induced pressure pulses to broadband noise and cavitation. In the present work, part of the activities carried out in the framework of the collaborative EU FP7 project AQUO (Achieve QUieter Oceans by shipping noise footprint reduction, www.aquo.eu) are reported. The paper presents the investigations carried out on a specific test case represented by a single screw research vessel, which is analyzed with three different strategies: numerical calculations, model scale investigations and full-scale measurements.",

      "abstract": "A statistical analysis of noise can play an important role in evaluating the performances of an acoustic system working underwater. If the system is either placed on board a vessel or operates nearby passing ships, the noise radiated by the vessel can considerably reduce the performances of the system if it has been not designed to have enough robustness. In the paper, a statistical analysis of ship noise records measured at sea is presented. Noise data were recorded in the framework of the EU FP7 European project AQUO (Achieve QUieter Oceans by shipping noise footprint reduction). Aim of the analysis is to characterize the ship noise in terms of probability distributions and their high-order moments. Since the overall ship noise is known to be generated by a number of sources with peculiar spectral energy distributions, the vessel spectrum can change considerably with a variation in the operating conditions. This approach allows determining the dependence of ship noise statistical properties on the actual navigation condition. In addition, since the ship noise records were simultaneously recorded by a vertical array of three hydrophones, a further analysis has been carried out to determine the effect of the receiver depth, and, accordingly, of the propagation path, in the recorded signal.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, the application of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods experienced an exponential growth: The increase of the computational performances and the generalization of the Navier-Stokes equation to more complex physical problems made possible the solution of complex problems like free surfaces flows. The physical complexity of planing hulls flows poses some issues in the ability to numerically predict the global hydrodynamic parameters (hull resistance, dynamic attitude) of these configurations and on the expected confidence on the numerical results. In the last decade, commercial RANS software have been successfully applied for the prediction of the planing hull characteristics with reasonable correlation to the available experimental measurements. Recently, moreover, the interest in Open Source approaches, also for the solution of engineering problems, has rapidly grow. In this work, a set of calculations on a systematic series standard hull shape has been carried out, adopting from pre- To post- processing only Open Source tools. The comparison and the validation, through the available experimental measurements, of the computed results will define an optimal simulation strategy to include this kind of tools in the usual design loop.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents the preliminary analyses devoted to the development of a new fast-craft concept, different from typical off-shore crafts, able to reach very high speed despite its main dimensions and displacement. In particular, the analysis is focused on \"deep V hull shapes\" of overall length of about 40 m and a range of operative speeds up to 60 kn. Many issues can be found during the design phase for a new concept boat. Besides classical design problems, well studied in naval architecture, new issues and peculiarities arise for these type of very high speed craft. One of these new relevant problems is related to the evaluation of the calm water resistance curve, for which the availability of data and reliable methodologies should be deeply investigated due to the extreme conditions analyzed. The correct drag prediction is a key point, for instance, for the evaluation of the on board installed power, necessary to gain the maximum speed required and, in turn, for the evaluation of the total boat weight (being the main engine one of the most significant contributor) on the light of its strong influence on the boat trim and consequently on the drag. Similar considerations have to be carried out for the seakeeping performances, in particular for what regards the vertical motions and the evaluation of the Motion Sickness Index. In these extreme conditions, actually, very high vertical accelerations have to be expected and consequently strict operative sea states limitations have to be imposed.",

      "abstract": "In the last decades problems related to ship manoeuvrability have gained more importance in the context of naval architecture. Among them, problems related to slow speed manoeuvrability, such as port manoeuvres and dynamic positioning (DP), for which less data is available with respect to the conventional manoeuvrability at cruising speed, have taken more and more importance. The classical manoeuvring models have been developed to evaluate the ship force for high forward speed and low drift angle, therefore in case of slow speed manoeuvres, where high angle of attack must be taken into account, they do not provide accurate results. Despite the lower number of studies, also in this case different models have been proposed by various authors during years. The accuracy of codes to predict the ship manoeuvring capabilities are, obviously, strongly correlated with the accuracy of the prediction of the ship hydrodynamic forces, which are computed via regression formulae based, commonly, on existing experimental data. In the case of slow speed manoeuvring, unfortunately, only few data are available, representing an issue for the prediction of ship capabilities. In the present paper at first a comparison of different empirical models to evaluate the main ship force components for slow speed manoeuvring is presented. Then a RANS approach in order to tune coefficients for low velocity models has been explored, in order to evaluate its ability to compensate the lack of experimental data and provide a suitable alternative in the design phases.",

      "abstract": "Sustainability and energy efficiency issues, connected to the search for fuel consumption reductions and to the more and more mandatory international regulations regarding the emissions of atmospheric pollutants, are acquiring a growing relevance in shipping industry. In this context, the integration of forecasting resources for meteo-marine conditions with the capability of performing detailed ship performances simulations may give relevant contributions to improve the in service energy efficiency of ships through the use of weather routing systems. These systems are today widely used, almost in transoceanic navigation, and their effectiveness may be improved if they are utilized in integration with other energy efficiency measures and with observing systems for ship responses and encountered meteo-marine conditions. The work here reported has been developed in the context of the PROFUMO project, financed by the European Space Agency, in the framework of the IAP Artes 20 Programme for Feasibility Studies. Part of the project activities are devoted to perform numerical simulations of ship seakeeping and powering performances along Mediterranean routes, by the use of high resolution wind wave forecasts data produced by the operational service of Consorzio LaMMA. With this aim, in particular a numerical model of a real Ro-Ro ship has been constructed and the results of the numerical simulations are exploited to evaluate the potential impact of the variability of meteo-marine forecasting skills on weather routing and to estimate the potential contribution to fuel savings of meteorological route optimization at the Mediterranean scale.",

      "abstract": "In this work an integration of high-resolution meteo-marine forecast data with detailed ship powering and seakeeping computational algorithms is investigated in order to asses the potential for the attainable fuel savings by weather routing algorithms along relatively short routes (w.r.t. oceanic ones) as those in the Mediterranean Sea. The capability of high resolution models to predict the detailed space-time evolution of meteo-marine conditions at the Mediterranean basin scale is exploited in order to reliably forecast ship performances along Mediterranean routes. Based on this a computational framework applicable to weather routing algorithms is implemented and tested with the main goals of improving operational efficiency, by fuel savings, and of reducing the navigational risks connected to heavy weather at sea. The main elements of the proposed approach are: i) the construction of a detailed numerical model of a real ship; ii) the exploitation of in-service performance data recorded during real voyages of such a ship to tune its numerical model; iii) the use of high-resolution meteo-marine forecast and hindcast data for winds and complete directional wave spectra to assess the fuel saving potentialities of the implemented computational framework cited above. This last task is performed by exploiting forecast data coming from Ensemble Prediction Systems (EPS) applied to high resolution wind and wave forecasts. The obtained results are very interesting and encouraging to further develop the presented approaches. In particular a fuel saving potential ranging from few points of percentage till nearly 10% emerged from the two studied cases. Moreover the approach based on EPS reveled itself to be very useful as an investigation tool for the assessment of the reliability and stability of the fuel minimization with respect to forecast uncertainties.",

      "abstract": "The integrated use of modern seakeeping and powering computational techniques and state of the art meteo-marine forecasting and hindcasting resources has the potential of disclosing new ways to approach some relevant issues, such as for instance operations planning at sea, weather routing, in-service ship energy management and pollution control. Such an integrated approach could be profitably used during ship design for optimizing both hydrodynamic and powering characteristics too. In this paper the authors describe preliminary results of a study aimed at estimating the in-service optimal efficiency propulsion plant setting for a ship in real seaways conditions. To this aim numerical simulations of seakeeping and powering conditions of a ship along a real route in the Mediterranean sea have been performed. In the simulations detailed meteo-marine hindcasting data, consisting of wind data and complete directional waves spectra along the route, have been used. Strip theory has been applied for the seakeeping computation in order to evaluate the contribution of waves added resistance in realistic seaways. Such results have been then used in powering computation, to evaluate the dynamically evolving engine conditions in terms of fuel consumption. The results of such computations have been analyzed to evaluate the in-service optimization potentialities for the available setting of propulsion plant. Finally, heuristic hints are preliminarily suggested by the authors as a support for the use of scenario simulations with realistic meteo-marine data in the powering matching phases of the ship design process. © 2014 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",

In present study, results obtained by means of traditional and well established semi-empirical methods for wake scaling and direct RANS computations are compared, considering not only the differences in the wake field, but also their effect on the propeller non-stationary behavior, which is evaluated by means of a panel code. The results of the study allow to exploit the differences which may be expected by the designer using these different approaches. © 2014 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",

      "abstract": "In the present work an analysis of the reliability of different numerical approaches, namely BEM and RANSE solver, for the prediction of unsteady performances of marine propellers is presented. To this aim, the well-known Seiun-Maru Highly Skewed Propeller operating in different wakes is considered. The results of this analysis show that, in correspondence to particularly challenging conditions, i.e. when very pronounced ship wakes are present, the two approaches may provide considerably different results in terms of propeller mechanical characteristics and pressure distributions on the blades. This problem, which is implicitly eliminated when the thrust identity approach is applied (as almost always performed, as an example, for propeller analyses aimed to the evaluation of cavitation extension and/ or induced pressures), may become critical in case the codes are used for numerical self-propulsion tests, where a high accuracy in the prediction of the unsteady propeller performances in correspondence to a prescribed value of the advance coefficient, instead of the thrust coefficient, is mandatory. The analyses carried out allow to underline which are the potentially more problematic cases, in terms of wakes characteristics, and to suggest some possible reasons of the encountered discrepancies, which will need further analyses to enhance the prediction capability of numerical codes.",

      "abstract": "Traditional engine-propeller matching techniques are mainly based on nondimensional parameters analysis: Thrust/advance coefficient or torque/advance coefficient ratio are the most used variables to assess the ship propulsion point or to match, at each selected ship speed, the selected propeller with the ship engine. The advantages of this robust and well established procedure (standard propeller open water measures only at some pitch ratios around the design configuration, availability of large databases and extrapolation laws) however, turn into the drawbacks for the inclusion of different constraints and objectives, further than the minimum fuel consumption, in the matching algorithm. On the other hand modern numerical tools and available hardware resources let to partially substitute, in the design stage, experimental campaigns and to collect large amount of information on propeller performances, including cavitation. In this sense numerical computations make out of date approaches just developed to overcome the deficiency of experimental measures. On the basis of these numerical data new algorithms for the engine-propeller matching can be developed capable of investigate different objectives and the influence of different constraints on the traditional optimum points. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group, London, UK.",

The presence of the hub and of the duct with the complex interaction that take places on the gap region, in fact, makes the design process of the latter propellers a difficult task if addressed with standard lifting line approaches. Build as a Lagrange multipliers minimization problem, the proposed design code represents an efficient way to overtake all the limitations of the original Lerbs' approach. In the paper the numerical design strategy is addressed, highlighting the capabilities to treat complex configurations. Afterwards the design of single and ducted propellers, panel and RANSE methods are applied in order to validate the design procedure: OpenFOAM is employed, first, to assess the accuracy of the design approach and the results from the panel method and, secondly, to visualize the flow features on the most critical regions (at the propeller tip and at the duct trailing edge) for which reliable viscous computation are needed.",

The aim of this study is to evaluate the capabilities of the CFD software OpenFOAM (Ref. [6]) to deal with fluid structure impact problems in the context of sloshing inside membrane tanks. More precisely, the objective is to simulate water drop tests for a smooth wedge on one hand and a wedge equipped with invar edges (like these which equip the Cargo Containment System NO96 produced by GTT) on the other hand, both falling into calm water without inclination. The obtained numerical results are then compared to Wagner's solution for the smooth wedge and to experimental measurements for the wedge with edges presented in (Ref. [2]). Numerical simulations are in very good agreement with Wagner's solution and experimental results (Ref. [2]) showing the OpenFOAM capability to deal with fluid structure impact problems in the context of sloshing inside membrane tanks. The agreement between numerical and experimental results confirms also that raised invar edges tend to enhance the magnitude of sloshing pressures. This confirmation emphasizes the importance of considering the physics of invar edge effects in defining the design pressure to be used in assessing the integrity of membrane LNG tanks.

      "abstract": "RANS solvers are becoming a standard for the numerical prediction and for the analysis of the flow feature around the hull, including the presence of the free surface and the computation of hydrodynamic forces. Panel Methods, thank to their computational efficiency, can still, and successfully, be applied for the analysis and the design of marine propellers. Self-propulsion requires an accurate solution of both the aspects that, moreover, strongly interact. Time and spatial scales, for the propeller and for the hull, are unfortunately very different and a complete RANS solution would require non negligible computational resources. A coupled solution, in which hull is solved through RANS, propeller through panel method and the solutions matched via Body Forces and effective wake is presented as a fast and robust tool for ship self-propulsion characteristics evaluation. First a simple \"unsteady\" axial actuator disk, which momentum source strength is evaluated from the instantaneous ship hull drag, is adopted to compute wake and thrust deduction factors. Finally a more consistent model, based on an iterative approach and on unsteady body forces, is applied in order to represent the three dimensional effects related to the effective blade geometry. Results will be compared in order to identify the capabilities of the coupling technique and the hypothesis of practical applicability of such kind of procedure. © 2011: The Royal Institution of Naval Architects.",

      "abstract": "A spatial non uniform inflow is the usual inflow to which a marine propeller is subjected to. Inside a ship wake, in inclined shaft condition, in tandem/contra rotating configurations, the spatial non uniformity of the incoming flow on the propeller plane leads to the unsteadiness responsible of thrust and torque fluctuations, induced pressures, cavitation and the associated noise. Any design method and, moreover, each analysis tool should be able to treat these phenomena, to carry out a more consistent ship oriented propeller design and to better understand the flow features and the performances of an already designed propeller. In the present work two different numerical approaches, a commercial RANS solver and a in house developed Panel Method, are addressed and applied for the analysis of marine propellers subjected to an oblique inflow, showing, through the comparison with the experimental measures, their capabilities and their limitations. © 2010 Publishing House for Journal of Hydrodynamics.",

      "abstract": "In the last three years, since the creation of the Marine CFD Group of the Department of Naval Architecture, the developments and studies in the field of numerical hydrodynamic for powering and propulsion of super yacht have been remarkably intensified. The paper intends to give an overview on the most recent applications of the research team through results obtained in recent applications, with the opportunity to introduce the main particulars of the devised CFD methods. Each presented application corresponds to a specific request coming from yacht shipyards, designers or propulsion systems suppliers which initiated and continue to support the Marine CFD Group of the University of Genova over several research projects as a motor of innovation. Presented applications range from resistance prediction of planing hulls in dynamic equilibrium, to a hybrid inviscid-flow/RANSE solver for displacement hulls; from hull CFD based form optimization techniques, to steady and unsteady prediction of cavitating propeller hydrodynamics as well as design and optimization of special propulsion units. The background philosophy used to attack presented problems is coming from a pragmatical naval architect cut: devise new CFD methods that could balance between the results accuracy and the requested time to obtain the solution, in order to be compatible with the time frame of yacht design. © 2009 the Royal Institution of Naval Architects.",
