      "abstract": "In power distribution networks, the growing integration of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) is increasing operational issues related to undesirable steady-state working conditions. In this context, this paper proposes a novel approach of distribution power system management, referred to as Smart Distribution Area Control Architecture (SDACA), based on a pattern recognition algorithm, that allows exploiting network reconfiguration contactors to find the most suitable grid configuration to mitigate steady-state network violations due to relevant share of RES hosted by the grid. The SDACA leverages real-time data acquisition and forecasted power generation and consumption data to determine the optimal switch states, enhancing the operational reliability and efficiency of the distribution network. To estimate the optimal network configuration, a pattern recognition model is implemented. Specifically, the extreme gradient boosting algorithm is used, exploiting its fast-training procedure and the rapid execution time. The performance of the proposed SDACA tool is validated in a realistic distribution grid layout, exhibiting up to 90 % accuracy in the identification of the network configuration, a capability of reducing the number of voltage violations of roughly 65 % in the considered test case network, and a 99 % effectiveness in minimizing voltage violations compared to the maximum achievable impact of optimal feeder reconfiguration on voltage violations.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes an analytical method to solve the load flow problem for radial single and multi-feeder power distribution networks in three-phase balanced conditions. The Analytical Load Flow (ALF) formulation relies on a single assumption for the estimation of line losses and accounts for line susceptances. A set of comparative tests performed on a total active and passive 33 nodes benchmark network allowed showing that the accuracy of the proposed method is extremely high, if compared with the alternative numerical solution. Furthermore, a specific analysis is proposed to evaluate the impact of the approximation on the losses in the determination of the nodal voltage phasors. Finally, ALF is validated in a realistic scenario with high integration of Renewable Energy Sources (RESs), considering seasonal variations in production and consumption. In this context, it is shown that the proposed method outperforms existing approximate analytical approaches, such as the industrial voltage drop method. The ALF approach, being fully analytical, does not require any numerical solver and can be applied as a valid alternative to existing numerical and analytical methods in balanced multi-feeder networks.",

First, the amount of inertia is calculated to constrain the Rate of Change of Frequency (RoCoF) within sustainable limits. Then, such inertia is allocated accounting for the contributions from Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs), complemented by the deployment of Synchronous Compensators (SCs) across various nodes of a Transmission Network. The methodology underwent testing within the Italian Transmission Network, utilizing the informational support furnished by the Italian Transmission System Operator (TSO). Despite its simplicity, the results exhibit notable accuracy, validated through rigorous comparisons with detailed time-domain simulations. Moreover, the low computational cost of the method, allowed a statistical analysis considering all the hours of year 2030, to get information on the distributions of the quantities of interest.",

      "abstract": "Highlights: The rapid development of electric mobility is introducing novel opportunities and solutions for electric vehicle integration into the electricity system. The integration of several EV-charging scenarios is a key element in defining a novel and smart integration of sustainable mobility systems, providing mutual benefits to EV owners, third parties, and the electricity system. This paper proposes a novel approach to EV-charging’s integration into the house/work routine of an EV owner, providing shared benefits to the owner and the working site, and providing an effective balancing of renewable power fluctuations. The application of the proposed methodology was tested in the experimental facility of the Sapienza University of Rome, considering real data coming from real load, photovoltaic, and storage units. What are the main findings? A novel integrated approach to V2B service; The exploitation of novel EV battery management strategies. What are the implications of the main findings? Improved exploitation of EV capabilities to reduce energy dependency and costs. Novel possibilities to achieve charging cost reduction by providing V2B service and, thus, making EV mobility more sustainable and affordable. The development of electric mobility offers new perspectives in the energy sector and improves resource efficiency and sustainability. This paper proposes a new strategy for synchronizing the energy requirements of home, commercial, and vehicle mobility, with a focus on the batteries of electric cars. In particular, this paper describes the coordination between a battery management algorithm that optimally assigns its capacity so that at least a part is reserved for mobility and a vehicle-to-building (V2B) service algorithm that uses a share of EV battery energy to improve user participation in renewable energy exploitation at home and at work. The system offers the user the choice of always maintaining a minimum charge for mobility or providing more flexible use of energy for business needs while maintaining established vehicle autonomy. Suitable management at home and at work allows always charging the vehicle to the required level of charge with renewable power excess, highlighting how the cooperation of home and work charging may provide novel frameworks for a smarter and more sustainable integration of electric mobility, reducing energy consumption and providing more effective energy management. The effectiveness of the proposed solution is demonstrated in a realistic configuration with real data and an experimental setup.",

This service, called Virtual Islanding (VI) and ideally requested to the RECs by the Distribution System Operator (DSO), basically consists in requiring that the net active power exchange between the involved REC and the main grid is zero for a specified time frame. The effectiveness of RECs VI operation is assessed using an Optimal Power Flow (OPF) that considers distribution network operational limits. Simulations, performed in a test case distribution system with massive penetration of RES, highlight the VI benefits both from a technical and sustainability viewpoint.",

The inverters interfacing the RES with the grid are equipped with dedicated controllers that set a power reference proportional to the rate of change of the electrical frequency (RoCoF) of the grid. In the grid following configuration, the RoCoF must be evaluated in real-time, but measurement noise and delays make the real provided inertia deviate from the imposed one. This work aims to quantify the effects of measurement noise and delays on the synthetic inertia provided by a grid-following inverter equipped with a virtual hidden inertia emulator, connected to a wind farm. Both simulations and experimental tests exploiting a hardware prototype and a real-time simulator are carried out in different scenarios.",

      "abstract": "The Energy Communities (EC) framework facilitates the active engagement of energy entities. It brings about a fundamental shift in the energy sector by effectively managing Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) and advancing a decentralized energy system. The implementation of this technology allows the electrification of rural or mountainous regions by addressing the obstacles associated with power grid maintenance through substantial restructuring of the underlying energy distribution framework. The present review aimed to investigate and examine the significance of EC structures and to start an inclusive foundation for the broader implementation of EC for energy decentralization to figure out the research gaps and ensure that Machine Learning (ML) based solutions are essential tools to study and further discussed the several ML-based algorithms based on their objectives. Moreover, a comprehensive literature review is conducted to compare the possible strategies and tools that could be implemented in EC. Furthermore, different solution tools are organized based on their advantages, such as Demand Response (DR), forecasting, and load management goals. Hence, it can be inferred that Reinforcement Learning (RL) methodologies exhibit considerable potential in the control field. In contrast, supervised and unsupervised approaches are essential in predicting tasks. Based on the existing knowledge, the present study can conclude that ML-based solution methods are of significant importance for developing an effective energy decentralization platform.",

      "abstract": "The ongoing replacement of traditional power plants with Photovoltaic (PV), Wind Turbine (WT) and Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) power plants will lead to problems of inertia shortage in future power systems. Thus, the provision of Synthetic Inertia (SI) by Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs) will be crucial in order to deliver effective Rate of Change of Frequency (RoCoF) mitigation actions. The present paper presents a methodology to assess the impact of IBRs on the available inertia in future power systems. The study, carried out in partnership with Terna, the Italian transmission system operator, focuses on a critical market zone in the 2030 Italian scenario. First, the availability of inertia by synchronous generators and already-installed Synchronous Compensators (SCs) is assessed, along with the need of inertia (i.e., the inertia necessary to limit the zonal RoCoF at the limit value following a reference contingency). If the need is larger than the availability, the intervention of IBRs is considered to limit the RoCoF. In particular, a sensitivity analysis is carried out varying both the limit value of RoCoF and the overloading capability of IBRs inverters, showing that the predominant SI contribution will be delivered by BESSs. Regarding RoCoF containment, if the limit value is set at 2 Hz/s IBRs are able to make the gap negative over the whole year. On the other hand, if a more stressful condition is considered (i.e., limit value set at 1 Hz/s), the installation of additional SCs may become necessary to make the inertia gap negative for the whole year under whatever IBRs overloading capability scenario.",

      "abstract": "Dynamic performance analysis of generating units in power grids relies on evaluating command and disturbance responses. Command responses describe how a system reacts to deliberate setpoint variations, while disturbance responses assess the system's behavior under unexpected changes. Metrics like settling time, rise time, overshoot, and steady-state error are essential for quantifying system performance and these are present in most up-to-date grid connection requirements. However, applying settling time to disturbance responses presents challenges due to the absence of standardized criteria for the tolerance bandwidth. This paper proposes a rule-of thumb to help clarify and standardize the quantification of settling time due to disturbance response analysis. The methodology is applied on a detailed test case considering the requirements derived from an Australian grid code, which is quite detailed and demanding in this regard. Results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed approach in providing a consistent and generalizable criteria for disturbance response evaluations, contributing to a standardized approach for assessing the generating unit compliance with grid codes.",

To date, the majority of investigations have concentrated on the Return Stroke (RS) phase of the lightning flash. Nonetheless, a significant gap persists in the comprehension of RS antecedents, particularly Preliminary Breakdown (PB) pulses, which manifest as a succession of transient signals occurring prior to the initiation of the first RS. Analyzing these initial pulse sequences yields critical insight into the processes that trigger electrical breakdown within thunderclouds. Accordingly, the acquisition of comprehensive measurement datasets and the development of robust models capable of characterizing PB may support the prediction of lightning flash progression and the formulation of more effective protection strategies. Within this framework, this study is intended to provide a survey of existing literature concerning PB data, examining aspects such as measurement instrumentation, recorded signals, data attributes, identification techniques, and statistical findings.",

      "abstract": "The development of microgrids integrated into residential buildings is a crucial solution for the deployment of renewable energy sources (RES) even on a small scale. In this perspective it is necessary to develop advanced and intelligent models of energy flow management within microgrids that benefit both users and the power system. This paper explores typical models of residential microgrids. Initially, a simpler model consisting only of a photovoltaic (PV) system and household loads is proposed, and then progressively to a more comprehensive model that also includes battery energy storage systems (BESSs) and electric vehicles (EVs) with vehicle-to-grid (V2G) capabilities. For each of the proposed models, an ad hoc algorithm was developed to manage local resources, with the goals of maximizing self-consumption and self-sufficiency while affecting the grid as little as possible. These algorithms, validated through simulations of real scenarios, can contribute to the development of methods and strategies for managing domestic energy resources.",

      "abstract": "Electric Vehicles (EVs) present an opportunity to enhance the flexibility of power systems through their integration with Renewable Energy Sources (RES) via Vehicle-to-Grid and Vehicle-to-Home services. However, EVs integration introduce challenges related to their management, influenced by factors such as user behaviour, fluctuating RES generation, grid or building requirements and battery degradation. Within this framework, this paper explores the applications of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms to solve optimization problems aimed at enhancing the flexibility services offered by EVs, maximizing the use of RES whenever possible, while accounting for battery degradation. Besides, limitations, potential solutions and new areas for further development are addressed. In particular, alternative solutions are proposed to address the challenge of requiring a large number of samples for the proper training of RL and DRL algorithms. Furthermore, to mitigate the models' dependence on stochastic variables-such as renewable energy production and load demand-the potential integration of forecasting models for these variables, as well as the implementation of virtual battery partitioning using RL and DRL algorithms is proposed.",

This transition calls for innovative solutions to fully harness the benefits of electrification across multiple sectors. This paper builds upon Virtual Partitioning Algorithm (VPA) that virtually allocates a portion of the battery of Electrical Vehicles (EVs) to provide Vehicle-to-Home (V2H) services. It investigates the criteria for selecting the virtual partitioning coefficient based on economic considerations, demonstrating how dedicating part of the EV battery for V2H service can beneficially impact on the EV total cost of ownership (TCO) considering a real prosumer case. This approach enables the EV to function as a stationary storage system, eliminating the need for investment in a separate Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) and also alleviate the TCO making EV more convenient and competitive for final users.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes the implementation of a receding horizon procedure to insert accurate and periodically updated Photovoltaic (PV) power production forecasts into an Energy Management System (EMS). This allows the EMS to compute the optimal scheduling of the dispatchable units of a Microgrid (MG) or polygenerative plant to minimize costs. The PV forecasts are obtained as outcomes of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). To allow reproducibility, the RNN is developed so that it requires input data available on open repositories and accessible with a timeliness consistent with the application. The RNN is used to input PV forecasts to the EMS. Two approaches to feed the EMS are compared: the first one hourly updates the PV forecasts and then launches a run of the EMS to dispatch the units for the next 23 hours. Then, only the control action related to the following hour are considered, and the other ones are discarded. The process is replicated hourly, giving origin to a receding horizon strategy. The second approach receives at midnight the PV forecasts for the next 23 hours and the EMS is run daily to dispatch the units. The effectiveness of the approaches is validated on historical data of a real MG comparing them with the ideal conditions, in which the PV forecast is exact.",

This paper presents a comprehensive review of V2X systems, analyzing hardware and communication technologies, with a focus on vehicle components. After discussing V2X communication standards, specific applications such as Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G), Vehicle-to-Building (V2B), Vehicle-to-Home (V2H) and Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), will be described, highlighting their advantages and disadvantages that will enable their large-scale implementation. Furthermore, the contribution that artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) can make to optimize energy flows, improve cybersecurity systems and facilitate the practical implementation of these technologies will be discussed, followed by an analysis of potential future development paths.",

To address the primary frequency regulation (PFR) needs, Transmission System Operators (TSOs) have introduced dedicated grid code attachments allowing IBRs to contribute to PFR. Moreover, also the converters connected to High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) links may participate in PFR. This study, conducted in collaboration with Terna, the Italian TSO, assesses the impact of HVDC converters and IBRs on the PFR capability of the Italian transmission network, with a focus on a potentially critical market zone in the 2030 year. The analysis considers two scenarios: i) the participation of SGs, IBRs, and two HVDC links (HVDC2 and HVDC3) in PFR, and ii) an extended scenario including the additional contribution of HVDC-1. The analyzed contingency considers possible failures of conventional or wind turbine Generating Units (Gus), single or coupled AC lines or single HVDC modules. In both scenarios, frequency containment actions successfully limited the steady-state frequency deviation within ± 500[mHz], with HVDC-1 further improving frequency containment capacity.",

      "abstract": "To address the issue of line overloads arising from the increasing integration of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) in distribution networks, advanced grid management strategies are needed to dynamically optimize network configurations. Within this context, grid reconfiguration methods allow to define the best configuration of the network to minimize line overloads, improve voltage values within the network and reduce power losses. Hence, reconfiguration methods allow to enhance the operations and management of distribution networks hosting a high share of RES. In this framework, this paper proposes a grid reconfiguration tool based on a machine learning algorithm, aimed at minimizing line overloads and reducing the number of reclosures in a distribution system. The proposed methodology is validated on a 10-node test network with significant RES penetration. The outcomes obtained show that, by applying the reconfigurations proposed by the tool, 56% reduction in total overload occurrences is obtained. The computational time needed by the machine learning-based algorithm to output the best configuration among all the possible ones is less than 1 second, demonstrating the usefulness of the proposed tool to cope with (near)real-time network issues. This result demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in reducing line overloads and improving the system performance.",

      "abstract": "The decarbonization of the energy sector represents a challenge that requires new tools and approaches of analysis. This paper aims to demonstrate the fundamental role that geographical distributed real-time co-simulations (GD-RTDS) can play in this regard. To this end, three different case studies have been analyzed with GD-RTDS, covering a wide range of applications for the energy sector decarbonization: (a) implementation of Renewable Energy Communities for supporting the share increase of Renewable Energy Sources, (b) the integration and management of Onshore Power Supply, and (c) the integration of a forecasting tool for the management of the Electric Vehicle charging. The performed experiments included fully simulated components, together with (power) hardware-in-the-loop and software-in-the-loop elements. These components have been simulated in different laboratory facilities in Italy and Germany, all operating in a synchronized manner under the presented geographically-distributed setup. The results show that the proposed architecture is flexible enough to be used for modeling all the different case studies; moreover, they highlight the significant contribution that the GD-RTDS methodology can give in informing and driving energy transition policies and the fundamental role of power systems to spearhead the complete decarbonization of the energy sector.",

      "abstract": "The energy transition is becoming one of the main challenges in recent years and it requires a fast discovery of new technologies and solutions to effectively integrate renewables in the electricity system. In this context, islanded AC Microgrids represent one of the most promising architectures, but they require smart and advanced control systems to allow fast and robust operations in all the possible operating scenarios. Among the advanced control techniques, Higher Order Sliding Mode control for power converters is one of the most promising solutions due to its ability to cope with model and parametric uncertainties without generating discontinuous control actions. This work presents the experimental validation of the approach proposed in a theoretical paper in which frequency and voltage controllers were defined that combined advantages of primary and secondary classic regulations. Such experimental campaign has been conducted at the Micro-grid and Smart-grid Research Lab of the Faculty of Electronic Engineering, University of Niš. Results show the correct behavior of the converters control in normal operation scenarios and the possibility to manage transitions between operating modes without any communication infrastructure among the generating units.",

This paper provides a techno-economic methodology for the estimation of the amount of additional inertia that will be needed in the Italian Transmission Network in the 2030 scenario, in order to limit the Rate of Change of Frequency (RoCoF) within sustainable limits. Moreover, the algorithm optimally distributes Synthetic Inertia (SI) contributions from RES and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs) and the installation of new Synchronous Compensators (SCs) among the Italian market areas. The method is designed to be sufficiently simple to process a significant number of working scenarios and the relevant quantity of information owned by the TSO. Nevertheless, the results have shown to be highly accurate as demonstrated by comparison with detailed time domain simulations.",

      "abstract": "The mass introduction of renewable energy sources (RESs) presents numerous challenges for transmission system operators (TSOs). The Italian TSO, Terna S.p.A., aims to assess the impact of inverter-based generation on system inertia, primary regulating energy and short-circuit power for the year 2030, characterized by a large penetration of these sources. The initial working point of the Italian transmission network has to be defined through load flow (LF) calculations before starting dynamical analyses and simulations of the power system. Terna 2030 development plan projections enable the estimation of active power generation and load for each hour of that year in each Italian market zone, as well as cross-zonal active power flows; this dataset differs from conventional LF assignments. Therefore, in order to set up a LF analysis for the characterization of the working point of the Italian transmission network, LF assignments have to be derived from the input dataset provided by Terna. For this purpose, this paper presents two methods for determining canonical LF assignments for each network bus, aligning with the available data. The methodologies are applied to a simplified model of the Italian network, but they are also valid for other transmission networks with similar topology and meet the future needs of TSOs. The methods are tested at selected hours, revealing that both approaches yield satisfactory results in terms of compliance with the hourly data provided.",

      "abstract": "Reactive power sharing is one of the main challenges in islanded Microgrids (MGs) equipped with multiple Grid-Supporting inverters. The traditional Q/V droop control approach faces difficulties in achieving proper reactive power distribution and maintaining voltage levels within permissible limits. To overcome these challenges, an innovative communication-less control called Q/V Dynamic Control (DC), which integrates boost and droop strategies, is introduced. The DC approach is presented detailing its control law and an analytic procedure is formulated to determine the parameters of the controller. Subsequently, a structural analysis for stability is proposed to clarify the DC responses in different operative conditions. Then, comparative simulations between DC and droop control are carried out using a detailed MG model, aiming to show the advantage of the proposed control strategy.",

This will help moving in the direction of a more sustainable energy scenario for buildings and energy systems also in the frame of novel configuration such as renewable energy communities.

      "abstract": "The integration of renewable energy sources (RESs) into electrical grids has experienced significant growth in recent decades, propelled by the pursuit of a sustainable energy future. However, as the share of renewable electricity production rises, the likelihood of overloading network components and having overvoltages also increases. Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs) offer a promising solution for mitigating RESs curtailment. Therefore, this paper proposes an energy storage sizing strategy aimed at minimizing RESs curtailment in a distribution system with renewable energy communities (RECs). This approach, which leverages linear voltage drop relations, distinguishes itself for its simplicity. The constraints of the optimization problem are defined to prevent overload of the primary substation transformer, issues of undervoltage and overvoltage at network nodes, and overcurrent problems in the feeders. Simulation results on a test distribution network validate the proposed method, providing a practical approach to sizing BESSs in RECs and maximizing renewable energy utilization.",

      "abstract": "The International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) is a cutting-edge project that aims to develop a sustainable energy source by harnessing the power of nuclear fusion. One of the key challenges in the development of the ITER is the complex electrical grid that is required to support its operations. To address this challenge, a digital twin (DT) of the Central Solenoid (CS) Converter Power Supply grid has to be developed, and real-time simulation strategies have been proposed to monitor and study the performance of the ITER grid. Real-time simulation strategies allow for continuous feedback on the performance of the grid, enabling the quick identification and resolution of issues. However, it is not always possible to perform real-time simulation easily in a real-time simulator; therefore, specific strategies have to be implemented in the DT. This paper focuses on decoupling lines and explicit partitioning as solutions to allow the real-time simulation of the CS Converter Power Supply grid with two converter units (CUs), as required by the ITER Organization (IO). As will be shown later in this article, the proposed approach is progressive and applicable to a more complex grid with multiple CUs. The results concerning the proposed strategies will be analyzed and discussed in terms of real-time performance.",

The proposed approach is totally decentralized as each source is equipped with a purely local controller and no communication infrastructure is needed. Moreover, a centralized secondary control is not required as the developed local controllers are able to nullify both frequency and voltage errors. Finally, the physical constraints related to BESS power and State Of Charge (SOC) limits are accounted and some theoretical hints are provided to justify why the frequency can be used as a triggering signal for the controllers to switch among the different operation modes even in absence of synchronous machines directly connected to the grid.",

In this context, the number of energy communities is expected to increase, and hence their effective integration is fundamental. This paper aims at assessing the role and impact of energy communities on the operation of a transition power system, still having a share of active traditional power plants. Simulation models and real hardware have been included in the experiment, based on a live real-time co-simulation. The results highlight both the significant contribution that the methodology (i.e., geographically-distributed real-time co-simulation) can give in informing and driving energy transition policies and the important role that energy communities may have in supporting the transition towards completely de-carbonized power systems.",

      "abstract": "The present work focuses its attention on a no-inertia Microgrid (MG) with the combined presence of a Grid Forming (GFo) and a Grid Feeding (GFe) inverter. During Normal Operation (NO), the GFe inverter injects a specified amount of active and reactive power, while the GFo one acts as a slack bus. This way, the active and reactive power balance of the MG is respected until physical limits of the energy source are reached. At that time, the GFe inverter has to curtail its power. The paper aims to analytically show that the frequency measured by a Phase Locked Loop (PLL) connected at the GFe inverter busbar increases when this happens. This can be used as a signal for its control system to activate the power curtailment without the necessity of communication between the inverter controllers. This way, it is possible to mimic what happens in traditional networks, even if there are no rotating units directly connected to the network itself. Comparison with a detailed simulation is performed to assess the impact of the assumptions made to develop the analytical model and, thus, to show its effectiveness.",

Microgrids (MGs) are one of the most effective ways to integrate Renewable Energy Sources (RES), and among them PhotoVoltaic (PV)-Storage (ST) configuration is relevantly promising. Focusing the attention on the PV and ST converters primary control, the main needs are to properly regulate voltage and frequency and optimally exploit the energy coming from the sun and manage the ST operation without any communication among the converter controllers. The conventional converter control approach presents several drawbacks and thus a strategy based on Higher Order Sliding Mode (HOSM) is presented in this work. The HOSM converter control strategy is fully analysed defining its control laws and the control schemes. A comparison between the HOSM and conventional control is performed with dedicated simulations on a common benchmark MG in order to highlight the advantages of the proposed strategy.",

The approach is based on the Model Predictive Control (MPC) technique. Thanks to the use of local measurements, each source can nullify the steady-state voltage and frequency errors by means of a dedicated MPC controller. Consequently, the proposed approach unifies the advantages of classic droop and master/slave controllers due to the absence of communication links among devices and due to the absence of a secondary centralized control loop.",

      "abstract": "Inverter based islanded MicroGrids (MGs) are very fascinating but challenging ways to integrate Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) in electric networks. Active and reactive power regulation is a major issue due to the necessity of optimally exploiting the sources characteristics and controlling voltage and frequency. Focusing the attention on the reactive power control, the main needs are to regulate voltage at suitable values and ensure a proper reactive power sharing among the energy sources. The conventional control for reactive power presents relevant drawbacks and so an Advanced Droop Control strategy (ADC) is presented to approach primary voltage control and reactive power sharing amongGrid-Supporting inverters in islandedMGs.TheADCstrategy is presented defining its control law and the control scheme with a stability analysis. Then, an analytical procedure is developed to set the controller parameters. Following, a comparison between the ADC and droop control is performed with dedicated simulations on a common benchmark Microgrid in order to highlight the advantages of the proposed control strategy. Finally, a comparison with other advanced control techniques is proposed in order to showthatADCis able to guarantee improved performance in terms of the combined regulation of voltage and reactive power.",

      "abstract": "This paper develops a Dynamic Market Mechanism (μDMM) to optimally allocate electric and thermal power in a combined heat and power microgrid. The market mechanism is formulated as a receding horizon constrained optimization problem, from which an optimal automated transactive procedure is developed. Its operation is distributed in nature and incorporates the most up-to-date electric and thermal load estimates and renewable generation. The results of the market clearing of the proposed microgrid μDMM are the spot prices and schedules for electric and thermal power in addition to non-binding estimates of future prices and set-points. The performance of the μDMM is illustrated using simulation studies of a Combine Heat and Power (CHP) microgrid model based on the Smart Polygeneration Microgrid (SPM) located on the University of Genova Savona Campus. The results show that the μDMM has the ability to adapt to new information via updated forecasts and improve the performance of microgrid operation compared to a centralized method. This in turn makes the μDMM attractive for use in μEMS (microgrid Energy Management Systems) by allowing new energy resources to be added in a plug and play fashion.",

In particular, energy islands without synchronous generation, for example photovoltaic storage, are of major interest if one aims at a sustainable transition of these systems. In this Microgrid structure Grid-Forming and Grid-Feeding inverters need to be properly managed in order to cope with the features usually provided by the main power grid, i.e. frequency and voltage regulation. This paper wants to provide an analytical demonstration that even in no-inertia islands, the system frequency is still a suitable signal to provide frequency regulation and thus to guarantee the power balance and primary frequency regulation without any need of additional communication among generating units.",

In this field the most used approach is based on the conventional droop control, but it presents some relevant drawbacks and so an Advanced Boost Control strategy (ABC) is presented to approach primary voltage control and reactive power sharing among Grid-Supporting inverters in islanded MGs. The ABC strategy is presented defining its control law and the control scheme together with relevant stability. Then, an analytical procedure is developed to set the controller parameters.

      "abstract": "The paper presents a review of the approaches developed to solve the problem of primary voltage control and reactive power sharing (Q/V primary control) among converter interfaced production units present in a microgrid. First of all, a general survey of the methods is proposed with specific focus on communication-less methods that are surely the most challenging. Then, the article focuses on a detailed comparison of state-of-the-art communication-less approaches such as droop control (the most widely adopted) and three more recent alternative methods. A comparative analysis is performed by means of dedicated simulations on a common benchmark network in different operational and topological set-ups to highlight their advantages and drawbacks. The main result of this comparison is that the new methods are all improvements to the traditional droop technique, but network configuration and parameters have a great impact on the method performances and so a univocal ranking among them is not possible. Therefore, the issue of designing an effective Q/V primary controller for microgrids is still a partly open issue which requires further investigation and research.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel decentralized and communication-less control strategy for frequency and voltage regulation in Photovoltaic (PV)-Storage islanded Microgrids (MGs). The developed approach aims at achieving a suitable management of the different operational assets of the PV-Storage islanded MGs providing seamless transitions among them and guaranteeing a continuous and effective power supply to the loads. Local inverter controllers are designed exploiting the capabilities of the Model Predictive Control; the resulting control architecture is a composition of local Distributed Generating (DG) unit controller relies only on measurements available on the DG unit site that allows nullifying both frequency and voltage errors providing a suitable repartition of the power request. This way, the proposed approach can combine the advantages of the classic droop and master/slave controllers as it needs neither communication among devices nor a secondary centralized control loop. Moreover, it is able to account for the Storage characteristics imposing a power curtailment of the PV units whenever either the power absorption or the State of Charge limit is reached.",

      "abstract": "This paper deals with the design of an innovative load controller for heavy-duty gas turbine (GT) power generators and with its practical implementation on real industrial power plants. A robust controller based on the Sliding Mode control technique is designed, in order to improve the performance of the GT system with respect to the traditional Proportional-Integral-Derivative regulation. The main aim of this paper is to fill the gap between theoretical studies and the real deployment of the advanced GT controller based on the Adaptive Sliding Mode control, an improved variant of the traditional Sliding Mode. The main focus of this work is to solve the main limitations of previous works for an effective deployment of the proposed controller on real industrial devices. This work is developed in collaboration with Ansaldo Energia S.p.A., the interaction with the industrial partner is one of the key points of this paper allowing the implementation of the proposed controller on real industrial microprocessors and the validation in a Real Time Simulation environment at the Ansaldo Energia S.p.A. R&D laboratories. The controller validation, performed in a Hardware-In-the-Loop set-up, showed highly satisfactory results and important improvements in comparison with the traditional regulation of the GT power generator.",

      "abstract": "Microgrids (MGs) control is one of the most important and challenging topics in nowadays power system engineering research. The most common and well-known primary control logic is the droop one, since it allows MG sources to share the power request and to participate to the frequency and voltage regulation without a dedicated communication network. Therefore, the stability of a droop-controlled MG working point is a crucial issue that is typically assessed resorting to the small-signal stability theory. However, such approach does not allow to understand whether an equilibrium point can be reached starting from a specified initial condition. In this paper, this problem is faced proposing a stability condition that relies on some simplifying assumptions. The proposed solution does not need any numerical methods or software simulators (often highly CPU demanding). The developed methodology is validated with simulations performed in the PSCAD-EMTDC environment representing the MG components with a high level of detail.",

      "abstract": "The primary regulation of photovoltaic (PV) systems is a current matter of research in the scientific community. In Grid-Feeding operating mode, the regulation aims to track the maximum power point in order to fully exploit the renewable energy sources and produce the amount of reactive power ordered by a hierarchically superior control level or by the local Distribution System Operator (DSO). Actually, this task is performed by Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)-based regulators, which are, however, affected by major drawbacks. This paper proposes a novel control architecture involving advanced control theories, like Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Sliding Mode (SM), in order to improve the overall system performance. A comparison with the conventional PID-based approach is presented and the control theories that display a better performance are highlighted.",

      "abstract": "Microgrids (MGs) interest is growing very fast due to the environment urgency and their capability to integrate renewable energy in a flexible way. In particular, islanded MGs in which distributed energy resources (DERs) are connected to the infrastructure with power electronic converters have attracted the interest of many researchers of both academia and industry because management, control and protection of such systems is quite different from the case of traditional networks. According to their operation mode, MGs that power electronic converters can be divided into grid-forming, grid-feeding and grid-supporting inverters. In particular, grid forming inverters are asked to impose voltage and frequency in the MG. This paper aims to propose a model predictive control (MPC) based approach for grid-forming inverters in an islanded MG. The MPC strategy is implemented because of its capability to define the optimal control actions that contemporarily track the desired reference signals and accounts for equality and inequality constraints. The overall problem formulation (objective function and relevant constraints) is described step by step and considers the specificity of the considered DC source. The proposed approach allows for the obtaining of very good results in terms of readiness against disturbances, even if it requires being fed only by local measurements. In order to validate the developed method, this paper proposes an experimental validation of the designed MPC controller in order to show its correct operation on a real system in a power hardware in the loop set-up using a rapid control prototyping approach.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes the design of a comprehensive inverter-BESS primary control capable of providing satisfactory performances both in grid-connected and islanded configurations as required by international standards and grid codes, such as IEEE Std. 1547. Such control guarantees smooth and fast dynamic behavior of the converter in islanded configuration as well as fast power control and voltage-frequency support in grid-connected mode. The performances of the proposed primary control are assessed by means of EMT (ElectroMagnetic Transients) simulations in the dedicated software DIgSILENT PowerFactory<sup>®</sup> (Germany, Gomaringen) . The simulation results show that the proposed BESS (Battery Energy Storage System) primary control is able to regulate frequency and voltage in Grid-Forming mode independently of the number of paralleled generators. This is achieved adopting a virtual generator technique which presents several advantages compared to the conventional one. Moreover, the proposed control can be switched to Grid-Support mode in order to provide fast control actions to allow frequency and voltage support as well as power control following the reference signals from the secondary level.",

      "abstract": "The large-scale spread of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) in the automotive industry is dominated today by continuous variable transmission parallel powertrain as far as medium size car are concerned. As a matter of fact, the tendency in this sector is to design parallel architectures in that they have provided until now a higher overall powertrain efficiency. However, technological improvements in many electric components and their increased efficiency can reshape this vision and give new outlines on HEV structure design. This paper aims to show the potentials of the series architecture, thanks to the latest electrical improvements especially in storage systems and power electronics. In particular, simulation models and fuel consumption data over different road missions are presented for the series architecture proposed in this study. In addition, a comparison between these results and data available in the scientific literature for state-of-the-art HEVs is reported.",

The intrinsic differences between the Diesel Generator (DG) and a Voltage Source Inverter (VSI) interfacing the storage system with the microgrid distribution system imposes the definition of dedicated control and power management strategies in order to guarantee voltage and frequency regulation in islanded operation. For this reason, a dedicated control approach is defined in the present article and supported by some analytical considerations in order to demonstrate the frequency stability and the correct active power sharing among the sources. Finally, the proposed approach is validated by means of detailed simulations carried out using DIgSILENT PowerFactory ® in order to account for a detailed modelling of the system dynamics. The results highlight the good and stable operations of the proposed Microgrid control architecture.",

The control strategy is based on model-predictive control (MPC), a model-based control that is widely adopted for the regulation of linear and nonlinear dynamical systems in various fields of application. The MPC is applied in a decentralized formulation, where only local measurements are necessary. The performances of the proposed control strategy are assessed by means of simulations on a Western Electricity Coordinating Council test case network and on the 39-Bus New England network. The results highlight both the good behavior of the MPC control technique, even in conditions that traditional emergency control would not support, and the robustness of the proposed structure against power system modeling approximations.",

      "abstract": "The new electric power generation scenario, characterized by growing variability due to the greater presence of renewable energy sources (RES), requires more restrictive dynamic requirements for conventional power generators. Among traditional power generators, gas turbines (GTs) can regulate the output electric power faster than any other type of plant; therefore, they are of considerable interest in this context. In particular, the dynamic performance of a GT, being a highly nonlinear and complex system, strongly depends on the applied control system. Proportional–integral–derivative (PID) controllers are the current standard for GT control. However, since such controllers have limitations for various reasons, a model predictive control (MPC) was designed in this study to enhance GT performance in terms of dynamic behavior and robustness to model uncertainties. A comparison with traditional PID-based controllers and alternative model-based control approaches (feedback linearization control) found in the literature demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

      "abstract": "The goal of nuclear fusion is one of the most important challenges in contemporary research and technological development. Its achievability will completely change the energy scenario and reduce the dependence on fossil fuels in the production of electricity. ITER project is focusing the efforts of many countries and researchers in the demonstration of nuclear fusion achievability. Beside the challenges related to the physic of plasma any other challenges in the engineering filed must be faced to realize such an ambitious goal. Among them, the electrical power supply of the ITER superconductive coils will be very demanding. Due to the particularity of the load, the total reactive power requested will exceed the limits imposed by the Transmission System Operator imposing to implement dedicated reactive power compensation strategies. This paper focuses on the two reactive power compensation systems that will be installed at ITER site, focusing on their interaction in terms of voltage stability during fast variations, such as load rejection. As will be shown later in the article, two main strategies for the reactive power sharing are considered. Results concerning both strategies will be analyzed and discussed in terms of system stability and the respect of design voltage limits.",

      "abstract": "Gas turbines are raising nowadays growing interest in the power generation industry. Being able to regulate their power production faster than any other form of conventional source, they are extremely valuable in compensating stochastic power fluctuations deriving from renewable energy sources in large-scale electrical grids, preserving grid stability, etc. In this context, gas turbines' dynamic performance plays a key role and it needs to be enhanced (however preserving the machine lifetime at the same time). Nonlinear model based control systems can effectively deal with this problem, exploiting the system structure to obtain optimal dynamic performance. Therefore, this paper aims at developing a sliding mode model based control for gas turbines. The results obtained from its application on a heavy duty Ansaldo gas turbine model (AE94.3A4) are compared to the ones obtained to the traditional control employed in these applications.",

Among the various MG control techniques, the droop is the one that has been widely applied thanks to the possibility of achieving a communication-less regulation of the MG. However some issues arises as far as reactive power and voltage control is concerned. The aim of this study is to draw some analytical consideration of reactive power sharing in droop-controlled autonomous MGs in order to highlight the parameters and configuration that can lead to undesired operational conditions.",

      "abstract": "Model-based control techniques have been gaining more and more interest these days. These complex control systems are mostly based on theories, such as feedback linearization, model predictive control, adaptive and robust control. In this paper the latter approach is investigated, in particular, sliding mode (SM) control is analyzed. While several works on the description and application of SM control on single-input single-output systems can easily be found, its application on multi-input multi-output systems is not examined in depth at the same level. Hence, this work aims at formalizing some theoretical complements about the necessary conditions for the feasibility of the SM control for multi-input-multi-output systems. Furthermore, in order to obtain the desired performance from the control system, a method for parameter tuning is proposed in the particular case in which the relative degree of the controlled channels is equal to one. Finally, a simple control problem example is shown with the aim of stressing the benefits derived from the application of the theoretical complements described here.",

      "abstract": "The increasing penetration of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) and, more in general, of converter connected power generation is progressively reducing the overall inertia of the electricity system introducing new challenges in the network Frequency Support (FS). Therefore, FS strategies for RES are becoming an important aspect to be developed in order to en-sure the secure operation of the electricity power grid. The aim of the present paper is to propose an innovative approach for the inertial emulation of Wind Turbine Generators (WTGs) in order to ensure a positive effect on the system frequency avoiding unstable operations of the WTG and reducing the negative impact of the rotor speed recovery on the secondary frequency drop. Moreover, the paper provides a detailed definition of the triggering logics adopted to activate and deactivate the FS making it suitable for implementation in available industrial controllers. The proposed controller is firstly tested on a simplified configuration to show its enhanced performances with respect to previously developed approaches. Then, simulations are carried out in a more realistic network to assess the positive impact of the controller on the system frequency. Results highlighted a 40% reduction of the system Rate of Change of Frequency while the frequency deviation at the transient nadir is improved by 35%.",

      "abstract": "Nuclear fusion represents in the current century one of the most important challenges in the energy field. Achieving such an important goal will completely change the energy scenario and it will reduce the current dependency on fossil fuels with a sustainable alternative. In this framework, ITER project represents the most advanced project for nuclear fusion all over the world. However, challenges related to the physics of the plasma and many others related to various fields of engineering need to be faced in order to accomplish the ITER project development. In particular, one is the need for the definition of suitable discharging units able to de-energise the superconductive coil power supply when necessary. This paper deals with the application of arc models available in the literature to support the definition of a suitable layout for the previously mentioned Fast Discharging Units. This can be achieved firstly by defining a procedure to identify the optimal parameters of the so-called 'Black Box Arc Models' in order to fit the experimental oscillograms provided by circuit breakers producers and secondly by implementing it on a circuital simulator in order to define the compliance of the discharging unit with the coil insulation limits.",

      "abstract": "The paper aims at presenting a methodology to choose the proper sizing of an integrated Photovoltaic unit and a storage architecture starting from the knowledge of the load and solar irradiance time profiles. To do this, first a simple logic to manage the charging/discharging of the storage is proposed, then the function representing the overall cost during the whole life of the system is derived. The computation of the cost function for different photovoltaic and storage sizes allows finding the best sizing of the system. Finally, a thorough economic analysis is conducted to provide criteria to check whether the investment is economically advantageous. This is done considering the impact of the economic variables which are more influential on the investment key assessment parameters. The proposed methodology has been validated in different realistic test cases against the results provided by an energy management system, showing an excellent agreement between the approaches. Moreover, the economic analysis has been applied to four realistic situations in order to tailor the microgrid components ratings on the specific test case.",

      "abstract": "The number of fully-rated converter wind turbine generators equipped with a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) has sensibly increased in the late years. The optimal utilization and controllability of a PMSG is achieved using a Pulse Width Modulation – Voltage Source Converter (PWM-VSC) that allows interfacing the electric machine with the distribution network by means of a DC link. The generator/Machine-Side Converter (MSC) controls the operation of the PMSG. This paper proposes a methodology to assess the feasibility of the steady-state working points of PMSG based wind turbines without running a set of time-consuming time-domain simulations. Three control objectives for MSC are usually considered: stator voltage control, unitary power factor control and torque control. The aim of the present paper is that of providing an analytical methodology to check the feasibility of the steady-state working points dictated by different control strategies of the MSC starting from the specific operational constraints provided by the wind power plants characteristics. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated comparing numerical results of a MATLAB® implementation against dedicated time-domain simulations.

The proposed meteorology is tested in an illustrative power system considering the integration of a grid-scale BESS equipped with inertial frequency response controller, the uncertainty of the power system is simulated by the variability of the power demand. Monte Carlo simulations and time-domain simulations, using DIgSILENT<sup>®</sup> PowerFactory™ are combined in the implementation of the proposed methodology.

The market is formulated as a receding horizon constrained optimization problem, from which an optimal automated transactive procedure is developed. The market operation is distributed in nature and incorporates the most up-to-date electric and thermal load estimates and renewable generation. These properties make our microgrid DMM, µDMM, attractive for microgrid energy management systems, as new smart buildings, battery storage systems, and renewable energy resources can be added in a plug-and-play fashion without reformulating the optimization problem and without adding computational complexity to the EMS. The result of the market clearing is the spot prices and set-points for electric and thermal power in addition to non-binding estimates of future prices and set-points.

      "abstract": "The present paper proposes an Energy Management System (EMS) to be used in grid connected microgrids. To do this, first a suitable model (for optimization purposes) of all the components that typically appear in a microgrid is presented, then, four possible electric network models are detailed and finally the overall architecture of the optimization problem of the EMS is set up. Moreover, as the optimization of the energy production/consumption of a microgrid relies on the thermal and electric load and on the renewables forecasting, an online empirical correction of forecasted data is proposed, highlighting its positive impact on the overall operational cost of the microgrid. Another aspect which is accounted regards the possibility of allowing the EMS to act as a power plant controller in compliance with the Distribution System Operator (DSO) requirements in terms of reactive power management and voltage control (as requested by the majority of grid codes and national regulations). So, the proposed algorithm structure splits the optimization problem into two sub problems: the first one basically dictates the active power production of the dispatchable units minimizing an economic objective function, while the second accounts for the satisfaction of the DSO requirements. The experimental validation of the proposed EMS is performed on the University of Genoa Smart Polygeneration Microgrid (SPM), where the proposed EMS is currently running. The considered test cases highlight the effectiveness of the proposed EMS in economically operating the microgrid (compared to simpler EMS previously installed in the SPM) and in satisfying the reactive power or voltage regulation requirements provided by the Italian technical requirements.",

The Distribution System Operator (DSO) requirements in terms of active/reactive power management and voltage control, as requested by the majority of grid codes/standards, are satisfied (if possible) by tuning the reactive power of the programmable units.

As many of them ask for funding from the EU itself, there is the necessity to define a methodology to rank them and decide which projects should be sponsored to obtain the maximum effect on the EU 2020 targets. The present paper aims at (i) defining a set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to compare different proposals, (ii) proposing an analytical methodology to evaluate the defined KPIs and (iii) evaluating the maximum impact that the considered action is capable of producing. The proposed methodology is applied to a set of possible interventions performed on a benchmark transmission network test case, in order to show that the defined indicators can be either calculated or measured and that they are useful to rank different \"smarting actions\".",

      "abstract": "This paper focuses on the modeling of wind turbines equipped with direct drive permanent magnet synchronous generators for fundamental frequency power system simulations. Specifically, a procedure accounting for the system active power losses to initialize the simulation starting from the load flow results is proposed. Moreover, some analytical assessments are detailed on typical control schemes for fully rated wind turbine generators, thereby highlighting how active power losses play a fundamental role in the effectiveness of the wind generator control algorithm. Finally, the paper proposes analytical criteria to design the structure and the parameters of the regulators of the wind generator control scheme. Simulations performed with Digsilent Power Factory validated the proposed procedure, highlighting the impact of active power losses on the characterization of the initial steady state and that the simplifying assumptions done in order to synthesize the controllers are consistent with the complete modeling performed by the aforementioned power system simulator.",

      "abstract": "The growing development of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) has seen the spread of architectures with transmission based on planetary gear train, realized thanks to two electric machines. This architecture, by continuously regulating the transmission ratio, allows the internal combustion engine (ICE) to work in optimal conditions. On the one hand, the average ICE efficiency is increased thanks to better loading situations, while, on the other hand, electrical losses are introduced due to the power circulation between the two electrical machines mentioned above. The aim of this study is then to accurately evaluate electrical losses and the average ICE efficiency in various operating conditions and over different road missions. The models used in this study are presented for both the Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) architecture and the Discontinuously Variable Transmission (DVT) architecture. In addition, efficiency maps of the main components are shown. Finally, the simulation results are presented to point out strengths and weaknesses of the CVT architecture.",

      "abstract": "The increased integration of wind generation via high power converters imposses numerous gauntlet to the management and control of modern power systems. One of them is caused by the decoupling effect between the power sources from the AC grid. It negatively impacts the system frequency response of modern power systems. This paper proposes a controller to enable the primary frequency regulation on fully rated wind turbine generators. The proposed controller is designed to enable primary frequency response mimiquing the classical syncrhonous generator controles. It includes a droop control and an other to enable the inertia response. Simulations on a test system are used to examine the frequency response provided by the prioposed strategy. The most important contributions of this paper is to demonstrate there is an actual limit value of the synthetic inertia gain that can be used in the controllers and that it is dependent on the system frequency noise.",

      "abstract": "Microgrids (MGs) may represent a solution in the near future to many problems in the energy and electric world scenarios; such as pollution, high reliability, efficiency and so on. In particular, MGs' capability to work in an islanded configuration represents one of their most interesting features in terms of the improvement of the reliability of the system, the integration of renewable energy sources and the exploitation of the quick response and flexibility of power electronic devices in a stand-alone system. In order to study and validate innovative solutions and control strategies for islanded operation, there is a need to develop models for MG structures that can be reliable and sufficiently simple to be used for the purpose of the design and validation of innovative control systems. This paper proposes a simplified, first harmonic model for a generic structure of MG characterized by its use of only electronic power converter interfaced generation. The main advantages of the proposed method lie in the model's simplicity and its reduced solving time, thanks to the limited number of necessary parameters to describe the system. Moreover, the developed formulation allows the avoidance of specific (and often licensed) software to simulate the system. The performances of the proposed model have been validated by means of a comparative analysis of the results obtained against a more accurate representation of the system performed in the power system CAD-electromagnetic transient and DC (PSCAD-EMTDC) environment, which allows for the representation of each component with a very high level of detail. Such comparison has been performed using the University of Genoa Savona Campus Smart Polygeneration Microgrid testbed facility, due to the availability of all the necessary numerical values.",

The FBL application will allow introducing an ideal decupling of the regulated channels so that power variation will have a minimal impact on the combustion chamber temperature obtaining a smoother and quicker response to reference changes in comparison with a tradition, PID based control. The proposed FBL controller will be also tested in presence of model and parameters uncertainties in order to verify the robustness of the proposed control technique.",

This situation decreases the total system inertia affecting the ability of power system to overcome system frequency's disturbances. This paper evaluates two inertial controller for full-rated power converter wind turbines, Type 4: (A) releasing hidden inertia controller and (B) fast power reserve emulation. Simulations over a test system are used for a preliminary evaluation of the mentioned inertial controllers.

For this purpose, an equivalent electric circuit is proposed together with an experimental procedure to evaluate its input parameters. The paper also highlights the simplicity of implementation of the proposed model into a microgrid Energy Management System. This allows the optimal operation of the thermal network to be achieved on the basis of available data (desired temperature profile) instead of a less realistic basis (such as the desired thermal power profile). The validation of the proposed model is performed on the Savona Campus Smart Polygeneration Microgrid (SPM) with the following steps: (i) identification of the parameters involved in the equivalent circuit (performed by minimizing the difference between the temperature profile, as calculated with the proposed model, and the measured one in a set of training days); (ii) test of the model accuracy on a set of testing days (comparing the measured temperature profiles with the calculated ones); (iii) implementation of the model into an Energy Management System in order to optimize the thermal generation starting from a desired temperature hourly profile.",

The procedure also allows evaluating the POI voltage variations, an important element due to the increasing requirements for renewable generation units to participate in voltage regulation. The main interest in such a methodology lays in its simplicity of application, that allows avoiding the usage of dedicated software for load flow calculations, and flexibility, that makes it suitable for the support of the bidding and pre-design phase of large photovoltaic power plants.",

The first step aims at performing an economical optimization, as it provides the active power set-point for the programmable units that minimizes the overall production cost. The second step is related to power quality issues (power factor correction or voltage support), as it produces in output the reactive power reference signal for all the devices under converter. Moreover, due to the presence of uncertainties in the electric and thermal load request and in the Renewable Energy Sources (RES) power production, an update forecasting logic is proposed that, applied at each time step of the optimization process, refines the forecast accuracy. The experimental validation performed on the SPM shows the efficacy of the proposed EMS in satisfying both the economic and the power quality objectives.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This paper proposes a methodology for the equivalent modeling of large photovoltaic power plants at the Point of Interconnection with the transmission/distribution network. The interest in such a methodology lays in the fact that recently Transmission/Distribution System Operators (TSOs/DSOs) have extended the requirements for the connection of renewable generation to their electricity networks beyond the only supply of active power, requiring ancillary services too. It is then a primary necessity for the Companies which operate in the market of large photovoltaic plants to have a simple but effective tool to verify the compliance of a proposed plant layout with specific TSO requirements (which vary from country to country) in order to support the bidding and preliminary design phase of the project. After an overview of the typical layout of large photovoltaic plants, the proposed methodology is fully described. In order to verify its reliability, the method is validated against exact load flow calculations on a test case photovoltaic plant layout. In the light of the good results achieved by the methodology validation, the last part of the paper proposes an application to infer the power plant capability and the compliance check with reference to specific TSOs requirements.",

The work focuses its attention on the issue of the microgrid day-ahead power production optimization. Such problem consists in finding the power production profiles for all the dispatchable units in order to optimize a well-defined goal (economical, environmental, etc). This requires to model all the components of the grid in order to define the set of constraints for the optimization procedure. In particular, the way of representing the electric power balance equations plays a crucial role since a trade-off between accuracy and computational efforts is required. Different approaches are presented and tested on the SPM, e.g. complete load flow, modified DC load flow and single bus-bar representation, in order to highlight the peculiarity of the different optimization models obtained and evaluate their impact on computational time, result accuracy and possibility of future experimental validation.",

      "abstract": "The strong increase in the number of installed photovoltaic (PV) production plants has slowly changed the assets and the operating conditions of the electricity power system. In this context, the supply and control of the reactive power from the renewable generation plants are becoming an important issue to be exploited that can facilitate the integration of PV and wind power in electricity grids. The aim of this paper is to propose an optimized control strategy to manage the reactive power resource generated by PV plants in order to improve the quality of the low/medium voltage distribution network and meet the latest technical requirements listed by distribution system operators in their grid codes. A methodology to define the optimal reactive power references for each PV unit connected to a generic distribution network is presented for a specified goal (e.g., the achievement of suitable voltage levels at the grid nodes). Such reference signals are then provided to the PV plants regulation systems, which are designed in order to guarantee the decoupling between the active and reactive power channels, due to the use of the Feedback Linearization control technique. The problem is formulated in a generalized way, so that it can be extended to any possible grid configuration. © 2013 IEEE.",

A Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme is adopted in the dynamic decision model for real time purposes. The decision problem takes into account the network load flows constraints and a state equation related to the state of charge (SOC) of the batteries.

The aim of the present work is to introduce an innovative optimized control strategy to exploit the reactive power resource generated by photovoltaic plants in order to improve the quality and efficiency of the low/medium voltage distribution network. Here, a methodology to define the optimal reactive power reference for every photovoltaic unit of the network is presented in order to pursue a well-defined goal, such as the minimization of the Joule losses or the voltage support. Such reference signals are then provided to the photovoltaic control systems that will guarantee the decoupling between the reactive power channel and the active power one, thanks to the use of the FeedBack Linearization (FBL) control technique.

      "abstract": "This article proposes an advanced non-linear control algorithm to manage active power and voltage provided by a synchronous generator. The algorithm is based on the so-called feedback linearization theory, which relies on the central concept to algebraically transform non-linear systems dynamics into fully or partly linear ones, so that linear control techniques can be applied. Starting from the basic (electrical, magnetic, and mechanical) machine equations, a suitable state transformation is introduced in order to apply the feedback linearization block to the generator model. A regulation scheme is then derived, which receives as inputs the measure and reference signals of both the electric power and the voltage at the generator side and produces as outputs the physical inputs of the machine, i.e., the mechanical torque and the field voltage. Particular attention is devoted to both the linearization process, where internal dynamics and stability studies play an important role, and to the design of the two (power and voltage) decoupled regulators. Several simulations are finally performed in order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach and to highlight its main advantages and drawbacks with respect to the traditional P-V synchronous generator control strategy. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

Grids can be renewed by resorting basically to six interventions: 1. Replacement/refurbishment of power components; 2. Wide area measurement, monitoring and control systems (WAMS/WACS), upgrading protection and control devices for communication; 3. Increase of voltage level; 4. Installation of power quality devices (Distribution Networks); 5. High voltage direct current transmission systems - HVDC (line and forced commutated); 6. Flexible AC transmission systems - FACTS (Transmission Networks). In this work, the attention is concentrated on the application of FACTS to modern networks and the quantification of their impact on the achievement of the EU energy targets for the year 2020 [4], including improved efficiency, improved renewable generation penetration and improved environmental compatibility (basically linked to CO<inf>2</inf>emissions reduction). Our attention will focus on the use of FACTS devices and the installation of newer and more efficient components. We won't deal with the problem of increasing the rate voltage as the proposed model for the network is in \"per unit\", so it is valid for every voltage level. Three main scenarios are investigated: in the first one, the aim is to find an optimal condition of the power system, in which the insertion of FACTS can contribute to increase the overall efficiency; in the second one, the capability of FACTS to enable the integration of a certain amount of power generated via renewable resources into a grid operating in a critical asset (transmission lines at their capacity limits) is analyzed; in the third one, the optimization of the generating scheduling of different power plants connected to the grid to obtain an optimum power set-points configuration for each unit from an environmental point of view is discussed. In this last analysis scenario, one has to characterize the different power plants emissions and relate them with the power produced, then generate the set-points with an 'environmental oriented' dispatching procedure and employ FACTS to reach the desired configuration.",

      "abstract": "The work developed and proposed in this paper deals with innovative control schemes applied to synchronous generators. In particular, the FeedBack Linearization (FBL) technique and the Sliding Mode (SM) method have been applied to regulate voltage and electric power. To do this, the basic equations of the generator have been re-formulated into the so-called normal form and, next, a proper state transformation and a suitable control law have been defined. Starting from this form, the SM algorithm has then been used in order to take into account possible model and parametric uncertainties. Several tests have been performed to highlight merits and drawbacks of both techniques, compared with the traditional regulation scheme. © 2011 IEEE.",
