The proposed method runs on IoT gateways and designs NNs for connected sensor nodes without sharing the collected data outside the local network, keeping the data in the site of collection. This approach has the potential to enable ML for Healthcare IoT (HIoT) and Industrial IoT (IIoT), designing hardware-friendly and custom NNs at the edge for personalized healthcare and advanced industrial services, such as quality control, predictive maintenance, or fault diagnosis. By preventing data from being disclosed to cloud services, this method safeguards sensitive information, including industrial secrets and personal data. The outcomes of a thorough experimental session confirm that –on the Visual Wake Words dataset– the proposed approach can achieve state-of-the-art results by exploiting a search procedure that runs in less than 10 h on the Raspberry Pi Zero 2.",

      "abstract": "The new generation of high-energy physics experiments plans to acquire data in streaming mode. With this approach, it is possible to access the information of the whole detector (organized in time slices) for optimal and lossless triggering of data acquisitions. With this approach, data rates, especially in large detectors, are often very high, and the network is likely to be the bottleneck for the entire Streaming Read Out system. The aim of this work is to study the implementation of a lossy compression algorithm based on Artificial Intelligence: an Autoencoder. With Machine Learning it is possible to achieve a high compression ratio and fast inference time with only a small degradation of the signals, almost negligible for the specific application. This work explores different configurations of the Autoencoder and the implementation on different hardware. Different Autoencoder configurations are explored to find the best trade-off between compression ratio and reconstruction loss, both for signals and energy spectrum. Different hardware implementations are also explored to find the best platform to achieve real-time performance for the specific application.",

      "abstract": "Hardware-aware neural architecture search (HW-NAS) is a powerful tool for the automatic design of tiny neural architectures able to fit the tight memory constraints of commodity electronics, like microcontroller units (MCU). However, new sensors equipped with neural processing units (NPUs) are reaching the market. In contrast to common MCUs, NPUs often do not feature the traditional division of the memory constraint between RAM and Flash usage. This is an issue for state-of-the-art HW-NAS, which are designed to fit the two constraints distinctly. This work proposes a novel HW-NAS for designing tiny Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that can effectively deal with NPUs, achieving state-of-the-art results in just 5 h and 48 min on the Visual Wake Words dataset, a tinyML benchmark.",

      "abstract": "Moving data analytics to the extreme edge demands for the accurate selection of the trade-off between computational complexity and power requirements. This is crucial for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) systems where sensors are typically battery-operated and equipped with resource-constrained processors. This paper considers the possibility to perform inference by using just one sensing node, hosting a tiny Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), for the prediction of the health status of the structure from vibration data. Emphasis is given to the importance of selecting the optimal sampling parameters (length of the acquisition window and sampling frequency). Experiments on the Z24 bridge benchmark show that a tiny CNN can achieve classification scores comparable with state-of-the-art results (>96%), while avoiding data transmission. An in-depth energy profiling has been conducted after deploying the sought model on a wireless node based on an STM32L496 processor and an accelerometer. It reveals that the selection of a proper duration of the acquisition time (half than typical duration) can halve the energy consumption of the sensor per hour (from 130 mJ/h down to 31 mJ/h) while introducing a minimal drop in the prediction accuracy (less than 1%).",

The article proposes two approaches: a reformulated version of hardware-aware neural architecture search, endowed with a newly designed search space to integrate depth (D) information into small-sized deep networks, and a dedicated fine-tuning approach, including a preprocessing layer to merge depth information with RGB data and make it compatible with conventional architectures. In both cases, these methods aim to generate solutions that benefit from modern (portable) hardware accelerators and overcome existing tiny-like approaches, which often fail to tackle critical scenarios due to the severe constraints set by the supporting hardware. Extensive experiments on a pair of real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method when compared with existing solutions. The approach presented in the article generates, in most cases, solutions that identify the Pareto-optimal front to balance generalization performance and hardware requirements. The article also describes the supporting prototype, including a Jetson Nano board and a RealSense RGB-D camera. When considering the energy profile of the device, the overall system can attain real-time performances within an energy budget that is compatible with standard batteries, such as those used in smartphones.",

      "abstract": "Traditional teleoperation systems rely primarily on visual feedback, often via virtual reality (VR) head-mounted displays, which may be insufficient in complex or dynamic environments, increasing the risk of collisions. Thus, haptic feedback was investigated to enhance Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV) teleoperation by improving obstacle detection. The haptic feedback was provided to the operator using a glove equipped with two motors that gave tactile cues based on obstacle proximity. Thus, the glove applied low torques to the operator’s hand. Therefore, an experiment was conducted on 30 participants to observe the effect of the haptic-actuated glove. So, a dataset was gathered, and different metrics were computed from the data to evaluate participants’ awareness, control precision, and responsiveness. Hence, the results proved the advantages of controlling mobile robots in complex environments for high-precision applications, such as hazardous material handling, exploration, search, and rescue.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes a new approach to near-sensor computing, in which a lightweight Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is performed directly on the deployment device to find the best tiny neural architecture for analyzing the real-time data acquired through sensors. This new adaptation capability can be particularly useful in the case of human-machine interfaces for which the neural network analyzing the biometrical data can be re-designed each time the user changes, after a guided data collection procedure, fighting the typical data variations between individuals on a new level. To implement the proposed approach a new NAS has been designed and then validated on the Italian Sign Language dataset (ISL), a collection of surface electromyography (sEMG) signals of the signs of the Italian alphabet, using several embedded systems. Moreover, further validation on the Case Western Reserve University dataset (CWRU), a benchmark for intelligent fault diagnosis, is presented to suggest another possible application of the proposed approach. When run on a Raspberry Pi 4, the proposed NAS performs beyond the state of the art proposing a tiny neural architecture having 0.63 times less RAM occupancy and 5.96 percentage points of more accuracy in the case of the ISL dataset; and 0.44 times less RAM occupancy and 0.2 percentage points of more accuracy in the case of the CWRU dataset.",

Different configurations of the autoencoder are implemented to study the tradeoff between model dimension, loss and inference time.

      "abstract": "This paper presents a design paradigm to implement convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on low-power commercial microcontrollers for the detection of landing pads in small-size drone applications. A neural architecture search (NAS) strategy generates and selects CNN architectures automatically; candidate networks are compared in terms of their computing costs and representation capabilities. The proposed NAS procedure adopts a teacher-student learning paradigm, in which the 'student' network should mimic the 'teacher's' intermediate representation. The associate selection strategy aims to attain an efficient feature representation that can take into account the peculiarities of the problem at hand. This approach allowed the generation of tiny networks capable of real-time execution on commercial micro-controllers (STM32 family). Experimental results confirmed that the resulting architectures could trade off generalization capabilities and computing costs effectively, and outperformed state-of-the-art solutions for landing-pad detection in small-size drones.",

      "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) is a key enabler for the transition to the automatic structural health monitoring (ASHM) of technical facilities, thanks to the seamless flow of data from a multitude of always connected devices. Current IoT-ASHM installations, however, face the double challenge to ensure high accuracy while meeting the requirement of minimal energy consumption. This article tackles these issues from a deep-learning perspective and describes an IoT-enabled monitoring approach based on a distributed end-to-end deep neural network (DNN). The architecture supports both data compression and damage detection. A low-end microcontroller hosts a specific local DNN; a hardware-aware neural architecture search strategy rules network optimization, in order to satisfy the resource constraints set by low-end computing devices. The features extracted from data feed an aggregating unit, which includes a stacked global classification layer for full-scale damage detection. After proper quantization, the designed models are eventually deployed on a wireless accelerometer sensor. Finally, a cost-benefit analysis evaluates the system's impact on the sensor energy autonomy. Experiments on a well-known data set proved that the proposed solution could achieve state-of-the-art classification scores (all metrics above 98.4%) with a minimal transmission cost (less than 53B on average); as compared with conventional approaches, the described strategy yielded a reduction of three orders of magnitude in energy consumption.",

      "abstract": "Compressed sensing (CS) for sensor-near vibration diagnostics represents a suitable approach for the design of network-efficient structural health monitoring systems. This article presents a solution for vibration analysis based on deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on compressed data. The envisioned maintenance system consists of a network of sensing nodes orchestrated by a very constrained centralizing unit. The latter is equipped with a microcontroller unit (MCU) that predicts the health state using the aggregated information. As a major contribution, the DNN architectures are generated automatically from the data through a procedure inspired by hardware-aware (HW) neural architecture search (NAS), called as HW-NAS-CS, which is uniquely refined with additional constraints that consider both the peculiarities of CS parameters and the limitation of embedded devices. The proposed approach has been validated using two real-world SHM datasets for vibration damage identification and eventually deployed on a low-end computing platform (the STM32L5 MCU). Results demonstrate that DNNs combined with adapted CS schemes can attain classification scores always above 90% even in case of very huge compression levels (higher than 64x): these performances significantly improve the ones attained by state-of-the-art approaches in the field, with the utmost advantage of being portable on embedded devices.",

      "abstract": "Machine learning allows designing intelligent sensing networks capable to perform automatic inferences about the integrity of technical facilities. Compression techniques decrease significantly energy requirements of the sensing networks proving essential when sensing nodes are not supported by constant power sources. Existing schemes pass through the reconstruction of the original time series data before moving to the diagnosis phase. However, this passage can be avoided, i.e., inference can be performed directly in the compressed domain, by exploiting the specific information retained in the compressed patterns. This paper fulfills the goal above in the context of vibration-based structural health monitoring by proving, from an empirical perspective, that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can be used to predict the structural health status directly in the compressed domain when properly combined with adapted Compressed Sensing mechanisms. Importantly, the study analyses the effect of the intrinsic noise that affects digital accelerometer sensors. Results confirm that CNNs can mine information in the compressed domain even in presence of strong noise components, i.e., accuracy remains above 94% even for ultra-low-cost solutions featuring a signal-to-noise-ratio below 20 dB.",

      "abstract": "Compact digital circuitry supporting data processing is a key requirement of modern engineering. This pa-per addresses the design of digital architectures for a crucial operation in multi-linear algebra: the n-mode tensor-matrix product, implemented in fixed-point representation. A pipelined architecture that optimizes throughput and balances area and energy consumption is proposed. A cost-effective classifier based on this architecture was deployed on an embedded system. Ex-perimental tests conducted on a Kintex-7 FPGA demonstrate that the circuit achieves efficient digital implementations, providing real-time performance on benchmark applications with power consumption lower than 130 mW. This implementation proves to be more efficient than its non-pipelined counterpart.",

      "abstract": "This article presents a novel method enabling point-of-care (POC) testing of thiocyanate concentration in saliva. Thiocyanate is an important biological marker; its levels are linked with diseases such as cancer and neurodegeneration. Hence, monitoring this marker frequently can positively impact users' lives. In the proposed setup, the goal is a semiquantitative reading of thiocyanate concentration from colorimetric assays in solution; the user-friendly, yet accurate readout procedure relies on a smartphone camera and is designed to be robust against moderate changes in indoor lighting conditions. The readout procedure exploits the capabilities of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to fully profit from a setup involving a custom color chart and the assay vial. Thus, a data-driven strategy is adopted to deal with color distortions caused both by lighting conditions and by postprocessing operations embedded in the smartphone camera. A neural architecture search (NAS) procedure explicitly tuned for the problem at hand drove the design of the custom CNN architecture. The method has been tested using a collection of real-world data and compared with existing approaches. The results presented in this article show an increase in accuracy up to about 14% with respect to state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Affordance segmentation is used to split object images into parts according to the possible interactions, usually to drive safe robotic grasping. Most approaches to affordance segmentation are computationally demanding; this hinders their integration into wearable robots, whose compact structure typically offers limited processing power. This article describes a design strategy for tiny, deep neural networks (DNNs) that can accomplish affordance segmentation and deploy effectively on microcontroller-like processing units. This is attained by specialized, hardware-aware neural architecture search (HW-NAS). The method was validated by assessing the performance of several tiny networks, at different levels of complexity, on three benchmark datasets. The outcome measure was the accuracy of the generated affordance maps and the associated spatial object descriptors (orientation, center of mass, and size). The experimental results confirmed that the proposed method compared satisfactorily with the state-of-the-art approaches, yet allowing a considerable reduction in both network complexity and inference time. The proposed networks can, therefore, support the development of a teleceptive sensing system to improve the semiautomatic control of wearable robots for assisting grasping.",

      "abstract": "Structural health monitoring (SHM) is crucial for the development of safe infrastructures. Onboard vibration diagnostics implemented by means of smart embedded sensors is a suitable approach to achieve accurate prediction supported by low-cost systems. Networks of sensors can be installed in isolated infrastructures allowing periodic monitoring even in the absence of stable power sources and connections. To fulfill this goal, the present letter proposes an effective solution based on intelligent extreme edge nodes that can sense and compress vibration data onboard, and extract from it a reduced set of statistical descriptors that serve as input features for a machine learning classifier, hosted by a central aggregating unit. Accordingly, only a small batch of meaningful scalars needs to be outsourced in place of long time series, hence paving the way to a considerable decrement in terms of transmission time and energy expenditure. The proposed approach has been validated using a real-world SHM dataset for the task of damage identification from vibration signals. Results demonstrate that the proposed sensing scheme combining data compression and feature estimation at the sensor level can attain classification scores always above 94%, with a sensor life cycle extension up to 350× and 1510× if compared with compression-only and processing-free implementations, respectively.",

The proposed learning scheme leads to efficient predictors supported by digital architectures. The resulting digital architecture can switch to approximate computing at run time, in compliance with the available energy budget.

      "abstract": "The availability of new datasets and deep learning techniques have led to a surge of effort directed towards the creation of new models that can exploit the large amount of data. However, little attention has been given to the development of models that are not only accurate, but also suitable for user-specific use or geared towards resource-constrained devices. Fine-tuning deep models on edge devices is impractical and, often, user customization stands on the sub-optimal feature-extractor/classifier paradigm. Here, we propose a method to fully utilize the intermediate outputs of the popular large pre-trained models in natural language processing when used as frozen feature extractors, and further close the gap between their fine-tuning and more computationally efficient solutions. We reach this goal exploiting the concept of software-hardware co-design and propose a methodical procedure, inspired by Neural Architecture Search, to select the most desirable model taking into consideration application constraints.",

      "abstract": "Visual affordance segmentation identifies the surfaces of an object an agent can interact with. Common challenges for the identification of affordances are the variety of the geometry and physical properties of these surfaces as well as occlusions. In this paper, we focus on occlusions of an object that is hand-held by a person manipulating it. To address this challenge, we propose an affordance segmentation model that uses auxiliary branches to process the object and hand regions separately. The proposed model learns affordance features under hand-occlusion by weighting the feature map through hand and object segmentation. To train the model, we annotated the visual affordances of an existing dataset with mixed-reality images of hand-held containers in third-person (exocentric) images. Experiments on both real and mixed-reality images show that our model achieves better affordance segmentation and generalisation than existing models.",

      "abstract": "Hardware-aware neural architecture search (HW NAS), the process of automating the design of neural architectures taking into consideration hardware constraints, has already outperformed the best human designs on many tasks. However, it is known to be highly demanding in terms of hardware, thus limiting access to non-habitual neural network users. Fostering its adoption for the next-generation IoT and wearable devices design, we propose an HW NAS that can be run on laptops, even if not mounting a GPU. The proposed technique, designed to have both a low search cost and resource usage, produces tiny convolutional neural networks (CNNs) targeting low-end microcontrollers. It achieves state-of-the-art results in the human-recognition tasks, on the Visual Wake Word dataset a standard TinyML benchmark, in just 3:37:0 hours on a laptop mounting an 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-11370H CPU @ 3. 30GHz equipped with 16 GB of RAM and 512 GB of SSD, without using a GPU.",

The feed from these sensors can complement, or even substitute, the information retrieved by RGB cameras.

The experiments confirm that the depth (“D”) components can boost the accuracy in predicting the affordable parts of an object, when they are matched with state-of-the-art computer vision architectures.

Hence, in this paper we identify the contents and sentiments in images through the fusion of both image and text features. We leverage on the fact that AlexNet is a pre-trained model with great performance in image classification and the corresponding set of images are extracted from the web. In particular, we present a novel method to extract features from Twitter images and the corresponding labels or tweets using deep convolutional neural networks trained on Twitter data. We consider fine tuning AlexNet pre-trained CNNs to initialize the model and AffectiveSpace of English concepts as text features. Lastly, to combine the image and text predictions we propose a novel sentiment score. Our model is evaluated on Twitter dataset of images and corresponding labels and tweets. We show that accuracy by merging scores from text and image models is higher than using any one system alone.",

      "abstract": "The introduction of Point Of Care (POC) devices is revolutionizing the field of diagnostics, thanks to their ease of use, portability, and real-time results. However, despite such advantages, POCs are still less accurate than traditional laboratory-based methods. In most cases, this is due to the qualitative on-off response of POCs along with readout procedures involving methods that are easily influenced by the environmental conditions or by the acquisition step of the result. Automation of the readout using machine learning supported by frugal devices and low-cost sensing systems can significantly enhance the quality of the analysis performed by POC devices, while maintaining the aforementioned advantages. This paper proposes the use of random-based neural networks to accurately assess the salivary antioxidant level detected through a colorimetric reaction. As a test case, a low-cost IoT device equipped with a trained neural network that infers the antioxidant level in the user’s saliva was designed and tested. The experiments performed on real-world data confirm that the proposed solution outperforms the previously proposed readout strategy.",

However, the full integration of deep learning algorithms into the small UAVs is still challenging for their limited resources.

The proposed architecture inherits robustness from the general-purpose version but limits the computational cost significantly thanks to a set of design criteria aimed to limit hardware requirements. Experimental results confirm that the proposed network compares favorably with a lightweight general-purpose object detector in terms of accuracy/computational cost trade-off. The system is also deployed on a commercial general-purpose microcomputer confirming that satisfactory performance can be obtained on general-purpose embedded architectures.",

      "abstract": "This letter presents a low-cost, lightweight, and automatic readout system for accurate quantification of cisplatin (Cis-Pt) level in a colorimetric POC device. The system relies on an RGB camera to record the color changes in the test tube and an inference function trained via machine learning techniques to estimate Cis-Pt concentration. A suitable training strategy for ensemble learning is adopted to deal with a scenario involving a small training set. In addition, the training strategy is designed to support a gray-box model, thus enabling interpretability. Experimental results show that the readout system based on the proposed strategy is able to outperform the state-of-the-art readout system for the quantification of Cis-Pt level in a colorimetric POC device.",

      "abstract": "In the past few years, the use of transformer-based models has experienced increasing popularity as new state-of-the-art performance was achieved in several natural language processing tasks. As these models are often extremely large, however, their use for applications within embedded devices may not be feasible. In this work, we look at one such specific application, retrieval-based dialogue systems, that poses additional difficulties when deployed in environments characterized by limited resources. Research on building dialogue systems able to engage in natural sounding conversation with humans has attracted increasing attention in recent years. This has led to the rise of commercial conversational agents, such as Google Home, Alexa and Siri situated on embedded devices, that enable users to interface with a wide range of underlying functionalities in a natural and seamless manner. In part due to memory and computational power constraints, these agents necessitate frequent communication with a server in order to process the users’ queries. This communication may act as a bottleneck, resulting in delays as well as in the halt of the system should the network connection be lost or unavailable. We propose a new framework for hardware-aware retrieval-based dialogue systems based on the Dual-Encoder architecture, coupled with a clustering method to group candidates pertaining to a same conversation, that reduces storage capacity and computational power requirements.",

Using object detection techniques, nowadays mostly based on deep neural networks, new intelligent camera-based surveillance systems can be designed, capable of generating alerts only in the presence of specific objects, like persons, in the camera field of view. However the memory and computational load required by these techniques makes it challenging to use them on low power, miniaturised and resource constrained surveillance devices designed for harsh environments. In this paper, we show an efficient method to detect the presence of a specific object in surveillance video frames using deep neural networks on an STM32 microcontroller, suitable for harsh environments.

The main challenges consist of occlusions, different filling materials and lighting conditions. The mass of an object constitutes key information for the robot to correctly regulate the force required to grasp the container. We propose a single RGB-D camera-based method to locate a manipulated container and estimate its empty mass i.e., independently of the presence of the content. The method first automatically selects a number of candidate containers based on the distance with the fixed frontal view, then averages the mass predictions of a lightweight model to provide the final estimation. Results on the CORSMAL Containers Manipulation dataset show that the proposed method estimates empty container mass obtaining a score of 71.08% under different lighting or filling conditions.",

      "abstract": "Wearable systems require resource-constrained embedded devices for the elaboration of the sensed data. These devices have to host energy-efficient artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to output information to a human user. In this regard, the single-layer feed-forward neural networks (SLFNNs) proved to be very effective for deployment on very low-end devices. SLFNNs showed promising results when the goal was to balance the trade-off between accuracy and predictor complexity. Nevertheless, the elaboration system, which consists of data pre-processing and features extraction stages, affects the resource occupancy, computational cost, and also eventual generalization performance. In this paper, we propose a learning strategy based on the out-of-samples technique that leads to finding the configurations of the elaboration unit and the parameters of the predictor that best balance the generalization accuracy and the computational cost of the whole system. An intensive study over the touch modalities classification problem shows that the best solution in terms of the only accuracy is achieved by the SLFNNs, outperforming existing algorithms. Moreover, the learning procedure selects the configuration of the processing and features extraction stages, and the parameters of the predictor that present the best trade-off between generalization performance and computational cost.",

      "abstract": "Embedding the ability of sentiment analysis in smart devices is especially challenging because sentiment analysis relies on deep neural networks, in particular, convolutional neural networks. The paper presents a novel hardware-friendly detector of image polarity, enhanced with the ability of saliency detection. The approach stems from a hardware-oriented design process, which trades off prediction accuracy and computational resources. The eventual solution combines lightweight deep-learning architectures and post-training quantization. Experimental results on standard benchmarks confirmed that the design strategy can infer automatically the salient parts and the polarity of an image with high accuracy. Saliency-based solutions in the literature prove impractical due to their considerable computational costs; the paper shows that the novel design strategy can deploy and perform successfully on a variety of commercial smartphones, yielding real-time performances.",

      "abstract": "Thermal, electrical and mechanical stresses age the electrical insulation systems of high voltage (HV) apparatuses until the breakdown. The monitoring of the partial discharges (PDs) effectively assesses the insulation condition. PDs are both the symptoms and the causes of insulation aging and—in the long term—can lead to a breakdown, with a burdensome economic loss. This paper proposes the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to investigate and analyze the aging process of enameled wires, thus predicting the life status of the insulation systems. The CNNs training does not require any kind of assumption of how the factors (e.g., voltage, frequency and temperature) contribute to the life model. The experiments confirm that the proposal obtains better estimations of the life status of twisted pair specimens concerning existing solutions, which are based on strong hypotheses about the life model dependency on the factors.",

This limits the computational complexity of the training phase without affecting classification performance significantly; the method best fits Internet of Things (IoT) applications. In the training algorithm, one first generates a pool of random neurons; then, an ensemble of independent sub-networks (each including a fraction of the original pool) is trained; finally, the sub-networks are integrated into one classifier. The experimental validation compared the proposed approach with state-of-the-art solutions, by taking into account both generalization performance and computational complexity. To verify the effectiveness in IoT applications, the training procedures were deployed on a pair of commercially available embedded devices. The results showed that the proposed approach overall improved accuracy, with a minor degradation in performance in a few cases. When considering embedded implementations as compared with conventional architectures, the speedup of the proposed method scored up to 20× in IoT devices.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents the T-RexNet approach to detect small moving objects in videos by using a deep neural network. T-RexNet combines the advantages of Single-Shot-Detectors with a specific feature-extraction network, thus overcoming the known shortcomings of Single-Shot-Detectors in detecting small objects. The deep convolutional neural network includes two parallel paths: the first path processes both the original picture, in gray-scale format, and differences between consecutive frames; in the second path, differences between a set of three consecutive frames is only handled. As compared with generic object detectors, the method limits the depth of the convolutional network to make it less sensible to high-level features and easier to train on small objects. The simple, Hardware-efficient architecture attains its highest accuracy in the presence of videos with static framing. Deploying our architecture on the NVIDIA Jetson Nano edge-device shows its suitability to embedded systems. To prove the effectiveness and general applicability of the approach, real-world tests assessed the method performances in different scenarios, namely, aerial surveillance with the WPAFB 2009 dataset, civilian surveillance using the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) Square dataset, and fast tennis-ball tracking, involving a custom dataset. Experimental results prove that T-RexNet is a valid, general solution to detect small moving objects, which outperforms in this task generic existing object-detection approaches. The method also compares favourably with application-specific approaches in terms of the accuracy vs. speed trade-off.",

      "abstract": "Artificial tactile systems can facilitate the life of people suffering from a loss of the sense of touch. These systems use sensors and digital, battery-operated embedded units for data processing. Therefore, low-power, resource-constrained devices should host those embedded devices. The paper presents a framework based on 1-D convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which tackles the problem of classifying touch modalities, while limiting the number of architecture parameters. The paper also considers the computational cost of the pre-processing stage that handles tactile-sensor data before classification. The related pre-processing unit affects resources occupancy, computational cost, and ultimately classification accuracy. The experimental session involved a state-of-the-art real-world dataset containing three touch modalities. The 1-D CNN outperformed existing solutions in terms of accuracy, and showed a satisfactory trade-off between accuracy, computational cost, and resources occupancy. The implementation of the 1-D CNN classifier on an Arduino Nano 33 BLE device yielded real-time performances.",

      "abstract": "Affordance detection consists in predicting the possibility of a specific action on an object. While this problem is generally defined for fully autonomous robotic platforms, we are interested in affordance detection for a semi-autonomous scenario, with a human in the loop. In this scenario, a human first moves their robotic prosthesis (e.g. lower arm and hand) towards an object and then the prosthesis selects the part of the object to grasp. The main challenges are the indirectly controlled camera position, which influences the quality of the view, and the limited computational resources available. This paper proposes an affordance detection pipeline to overcome framing issues leveraging object detectors and a reduced computational load for the pipeline to run on resource-constrained platforms. Experimental results on two state-of-the-art datasets show improvements in affordance detection with respect to the baseline solution which consists in considering only an affordance detection model. We argue that the combination of the selected models allows achieving a trade-off between performance and computational for embedded, resource-constrained systems.",

      "abstract": "State of the Art solutions for image classification are nowadays mostly based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), With respect to running them for inference, training CNNs is a much more resource demanding job. For this reason, embedded devices designed to execute neural networks are normally not suitable to train the same networks. Hand image classification is becoming increasingly popular in several application areas, by empowering embedded systems with the ability to recognise hand gestures or grasp types. In this field, making it possible to retrain the hand image classifier directly on the embedded device would allow an easy customization of classification task according to application specific needs. In this paper we present a method based on transfer learning which solves this problem by first extracting hand keypoints, using with a dedicated neural network, and then applying on the resulting data a lightweight classifier, easily retrainable directly on the target embedded system. The proposal has been validated on a new freely distributed dataset, outperforming state of the art solutions in the specific task.",

      "abstract": "Affordance detection in computer vision allows segmenting an object into parts according to functions that those parts afford. Most solutions for affordance detection are developed in robotics using deep learning architectures that require substantial computing power. Therefore, these approaches are not convenient for application in embedded systems with limited resources. For instance, computer vision is used in smart prosthetic limbs, and in this context, affordance detection could be employed to determine the graspable segments of an object, which is a critical information for selecting a grasping strategy. This work proposes an affordance detection strategy based on hardware-aware deep learning solutions. Experimental results confirmed that the proposed solution achieves comparable accuracy with respect to the state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, the model was implemented on real-time embedded devices obtaining a high FPS rate, with limited power consumption. Finally, the experimental assessment in realistic conditions demonstrated that the developed method is robust and reliable. As a major outcome, the paper proposes and characterizes the first complete embedded solution for affordance detection in embedded devices. Such a solution could be used to substantially improve computer vision based prosthesis control but it is also highly relevant for other applications (e.g., resource-constrained robotic systems).",

      "abstract": "Thanks to recent advances in machine learning, some say AI is the new engine and data is the new coal. Mining this 'coal' from the ever-growing Social Web, however, can be a formidable task. In this work, we address this problem in the context of sentiment analysis using convolutional online adaptation learning (COAL). In particular, we consider semi-supervised learning of convolutional features, which we use to train an online model. Such a model, which can be trained in one domain but also used to predict sentiment in other domains, outperforms the baseline in the range of 5-20%.",

      "abstract": "Edge computing can take full advantage of data-driven models only if the eventual inference function can be deployed on low-power, resource-constrained digital devices. In this regard, single layer feedforward neural networks (SLFNs) based on the threshold activation function represent a suitable option, as they can suitably balance generalization performances and computational costs. Their robustness to perturbations at the node level, though, is an issue: a small perturbation affecting the input to the activation might result in a sign inversion at the output of the neuron. This in turn may severely affect the accuracy of the inference function when implemented on hardware. This paper shows that the robustness of this class of SLFNs can be improved by introducing in the cost function a regularization term specifically designed to limit the impacts of perturbations at the node level. The novel cost function indeed admits a closed-form solution. Experimental validation involved six real world benchmarks.",

The paper presents a design strategy, aimed at low-end reconfigurable devices, for implementing the prediction operation supported by a single hidden-layer feedforward neural network (SLFN). The paper first shows that a considerable efficiency can be obtained when hard-limiter thresholding operators support the activation functions of the neurons. Secondly, the analysis highlights the advantages of using random basis networks, thanks to their limited memory requirements. Finally, the paper presents a pair of different architectural approaches to the effective support of SLFNs on CPLDs and low-end FPGAs. The alternatives differ in the specific trade-off strategy between area utilization and latency. Experiments confirm the effectiveness of both schemes, yielding a pair of viable implementation options for satisfying the respective constraints, namely effective area utilization or low latency.",

Partial discharges (PDs) phenomena affect the insulation system of an electrical machine and—in the long term—can lead to a breakdown, with a consequent, significant economic loss; wind turbines provide an excellent example. Embedded solutions are therefore required to monitor the insulation status. The paper presents an online system that adopts unsupervised methodologies for assessing the condition of the monitored machine in real time. The monitoring process does not rely on any prior knowledge about the apparatus; nonetheless, the method can identify the relevant drifts in the machine status.

      "abstract": "The online monitoring of a high voltage apparatus is a crucial aspect for a predictive maintenance program. The insulation system of an electrical machine is affected by partial discharges (PDs) phenomena that—in the long term—can lead to the breakdown. This in turn may bring about a significant economic loss; wind turbines provide an excellent example. Thus, it is necessary to adopt embedded solutions for monitoring the insulation status. This paper introduces an online system that exploit fully unsupervised methodologies to assess in real-time the condition of the monitored machine. Accordingly, the monitoring process does not rely on any prior knowledge about the apparatus. Nonetheless, the proposed system can identify the relevant drifts in the machine status. Notably, the system is designed to run on low-cost embedded devices.",

Indeed, computational aspects represent a major issue, as hand grasp analysis is expected to support grasping systems that are hosted on low-power embedded systems. This paper proposes a framework for video-based grasping classification that is designed for implementation on resource-constrained devices. The framework adopts a fully data-driven strategy and relies on deep learning to deal with advanced analysis of video signals. Nonetheless, the overall design takes advantage of CNN architectures that can cope with the constraints imposed by embedded systems. The experimental session involved a real-world dataset containing daily life activities collected using egocentric perspective. In addition, the complete inference system is implemented on a NVIDIA Jetson-TX2 obtaining real time performances. The results confirm that the proposed system can suitably balance the trade off between accuracy and computational costs.",

      "abstract": "Embedded machine learning relies on inference functions that can fit resource-constrained, low-power computing devices. The literature proves that single layer neural networks using threshold functions can provide a suitable trade off between classification accuracy and computational cost. In this regard, the number of neurons directly impacts both on computational complexity and on resources allocation. Thus, the present research aims at designing an efficient pruning technique that can take into account the peculiarities of the threshold function. The paper shows that feature selection criteria based on filter models can effectively be applied to neuron selection. In particular, valuable outcomes can be obtained by designing ad-hoc objective functions for the selection process. An extensive experimental campaign confirms that the proposed objective function compares favourably with state-of-the-art pruning techniques.",

      "abstract": "The availability of an effective embedding to represent textual information is important in commonsense reasoning. Assessing the quality of an embedding is challenging. In most approaches, embeddings are built using statistical properties of the data that are not directly interpretable by a human user. Numerical methods can be inconsistent with respect to the target problem from a cognitive view point. This paper addresses the issue by developing a protocol for evaluating the coherence between an embedding space and a given cognitive model. The protocol uses the recently introduced notion of principal path, which can support the exploration of a high-dimensional space. The protocol provides a qualitative measure of concept distributions in a graphical format, which allows the embedding properties to be analyzed. As a consequence, the tool mitigates the black-box effect that is typical of automatic inference processes. The experimental section involves the characterization of AffectiveSpace, demonstrating that the proposed approach can be used to describe embeddings. The reference cognitive model is the hourglass model of emotions.",

      "abstract": "The development of automated tools capable of monitoring electric motors is important for industrial applications. The measure of partial discharges is one of the most prominent methodologies for the evaluation of electric motors operating conditions. This work proposes to apply tensor-based classification methods to discriminate between different partial discharges sources. The major advantage of tensor-based approaches relies on the fact that they can inherently handle partial discharges pattern using all the geometrical information embedded in the patterns. Secondly, noise filtering can be embedded in classification mechanism, without manual tuning. As a consequence, better performances are obtained in presence of additive sources of noise like 4G, GSM connections and electromagnetic sources that could be detected by conducted and irradiated sensors especially during an online monitoring. To demonstrate the ability of the tensor-based methods to overcome the noise presence, tests involved defects with different levels of addictive noises. Experimental results proved the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

      "abstract": "Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) provide an effective tool to extract complex information from images. In the area of image polarity detection, CNNs are customarily utilized in combination with transfer learning techniques to tackle a major problem: The unavailability of large sets of labeled data. Thus, polarity predictors in general exploit a pre-trained CNN as the feature extractor that in turn feeds a classification unit. While the latter unit is trained from scratch, the pre-trained CNN is subject to fine-tuning. As a result, the specific CNN architecture employed as the feature extractor strongly affects the overall performance of the model. This paper analyses state-of-the-art literature on image polarity detection and identifies the most reliable CNN architectures. Moreover, the paper provides an experimental protocol that should allow assessing the role played by the baseline architecture in the polarity detection task. Performance is evaluated in terms of both generalization abilities and computational complexity. The latter attribute becomes critical as polarity predictors, in the era of social networks, might need to be updated within hours or even minutes. In this regard, the paper gives practical hints on the advantages and disadvantages of the examined architectures both in terms of generalization and computational cost.",

      "abstract": "Machine learning algorithms are typically designed to deal with data represented as vectors. Several major applications, however, involve multi-way data, such as video sequences and multi-sensory arrays. In those cases, tensors endow a more consistent way to capture multi-modal relations, which may be lost by a conventional remapping of original data into a vector representation. This paper presents a tensor-oriented machine learning framework, and shows that the theory of learning with similarity functions provides an effective paradigm to support this framework. The proposed approach adopts a specific similarity function, which defines a measure of similarity between a pair of tensors. The performance of the tensor-based framework is evaluated on a set of complex, real-world, pattern-recognition problems. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the framework, which compares favorably with state-of-the-art machine learning methodologies that can accept tensors as inputs. Indeed, a formal analysis proves that the framework is more efficient than state-of-the-art methodologies also in terms of computational cost. The paper thus provides two main outcomes: (1) a theoretical framework that enables the use of tensor-oriented similarity notions and (2) a cognitively inspired notion of similarity that leads to computationally efficient predictors.",

      "abstract": "Ahstract-In order to recognize on-line different kind of defects where partial discharges take place it is necessary to employ an embedded acquisition system, possibly low-cost, near to the discharges site. Such acquisition system should be capable to analyze the acquired data in real time to recognize different defect sources. For this reason, a single hidden-layer feedforward neural network (SLFN) is presented in this work. Such neural network inherits the approach adopted by the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), but its activation functions are based on hardware friendly step (hard-limit) function. This facilitates the hardware resources optimization. In order to show the effectiveness of this solution different kind of PDs signals have been acquired. Once the data have been available, they have been divided in two sets: training and test. The training data have been used off-line to construct the model. Therefore the test data have been used on-line to perform the neural network. Moreover a comparison, in term of generalization error, between the classic ELM (based on complex activation functions, e.g. sigmoid), the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and the digital realization has been analyzed and showed. The results demonstrate how a simple algorithm as a single layer feedforward neural network is able to distinguish different kind of PDs using limited resources. Eventually the occupation area is shown on different low-cost devices varying the number of neurons in the hidden layer. The new ELM digital implementation is able to achieve good results, in term of generalization error when involved in supervised problems recognizing different kind of PD activity. These results are comparable to the ones obtainable by mean of standard ELM and SVM.",

      "abstract": "Subjectivity detection is a task of natural language processing that aims to remove ‘factual’ or ‘neutral’ content, i.e., objective text that does not contain any opinion, from online product reviews. Such a pre-processing step is crucial to increase the accuracy of sentiment analysis systems, as these are usually optimized for the binary classification task of distinguishing between positive and negative content. In this paper, we extend the extreme learning machine (ELM) paradigm to a novel framework that exploits the features of both Bayesian networks and fuzzy recurrent neural networks to perform subjectivity detection. In particular, Bayesian networks are used to build a network of connections among the hidden neurons of the conventional ELM configuration in order to capture dependencies in high-dimensional data. Next, a fuzzy recurrent neural network inherits the overall structure generated by the Bayesian networks to model temporal features in the predictor. Experimental results confirmed the ability of the proposed framework to deal with standard subjectivity detection problems and also proved its capacity to address portability across languages in translation tasks.",

      "abstract": "The paper addresses the role of randomization in the training process of a learning machine, and analyses the affinities between two well-known schemes, namely, Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) and the learning framework using similarity functions. These paradigms share a common approach to inductive learning, which combines an explicit remapping of data with a linear separator; however, they seem to exploit different strategies in the design of the mapping layer. The paper shows that, in fact, the theory of learning with similarity functions can stimulate a novel interpretation of the ELM paradigm, thus leading to a common framework. New insights into the ELM model are obtained, and the ELM strategy for the setup of the neurons’ parameters can be significantly improved. Experimental results confirm that the novel method improves over conventional approaches, especially in the trade-off between classification accuracy and machine complexity (i.e., the dimensionality of the remapped space). This, in turn, supports the reliability of the unified framework envisioned in this paper.",
