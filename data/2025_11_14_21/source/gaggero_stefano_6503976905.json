      "abstract": "Hydrodynamic aspects of autonomous underwater vehicles, even if often underestimated, play a crucial role in the overall vessel design. Over the past few decades, computational fluid dynamics has become a widely used tool for investigating complex hydrodynamic problems in a fast and reliable way, often substituting the most expensive and time-consuming experimental campaigns. Nevertheless, even if several researchers adopt these approaches to investigate some specific aspect (i.e. vehicle resistance, PMM tests, etc.), from an industrial point of view they are rarely used in the vehicle design stages (in particular during the preliminary ones), because of vehicles designs are primary driven by control aspects (i.e. payload arrangements, propulsion layout, etc.). The present paper tries to show possible research fields where these numerical tools can provide a valuable contribution to their design. Different aspects are investigated, ranging from the typical ones, such as the impact of the vehicle geometry on the resistance, to the most complex ones, such as hull-propeller interactions in hovering conditions. This activity demonstrates that a more deep knowledge of these hydrodynamic aspects can better drive the vehicle design, obtaining a more effective and efficient design.",

      "abstract": "Cycloidal propellers (CPs) are a unique type of propulsion system that offers exceptional maneuverability, making them ideal for specialized marine applications, such as the dynamic positioning of ships. However, only a few experimental or numerical studies exist on their performance and dynamic behavior. Almost no information can be found on the occurrence of cavitation and its influence on the propulsor performance despite the very high angle of attack to which the blades of this type of propeller are subjected. To preliminary address this lack of data, this paper presents a numerical study on the performance of cycloidal propellers, focusing on thrust generation, efficiency, and cavitation occurrence. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach based on the solution of RANS equations is employed to analyze the flow characteristics and pressure distribution around the rotating blades. Additionally, the influence of cavitation on CP performance is investigated, considering its impact on thrust fluctuations and efficiency losses at different functioning conditions, characterized by different advance coefficients and cavitation indexes. The findings contribute to understanding the behavior of CP under realistic operating conditions, offering guidance for future developments in this type of high-performance propulsion system.",

In this context, a large effort has been spent in the study of cavitating propeller noise since it represents the dominating noise source on ships. Over the years, the University of Genoa has developed strategies for propeller design by optimisation aimed to the reduction of cavitation and noise as a side effect, limiting possible negative consequences on the propulsion efficiency. In the context of the EU-funded LIFE-PIAQUO project it was possible to perform a complete optimisation activity, starting from a real test case (a small passenger boat operating in Mediterranean marine protected areas) and retrofitting the propellers for dedicated sea trials. The present paper reports the main results of these activities, highlighting the capability of the proposed methods, through a comparative full-scale validation of the outcomes of the design activity.",

      "abstract": "Axial waterjets are widely used for marine propulsion due to their efficiency and maneuverability. However, conventional design procedures heavily rely on empirical correlations and simplified models, limiting their ability to fully exploit the hydrodynamic performance potential of these devices. The study highlights how Simulation-Based Design Optimization (SBDO) approaches, coupled with the high-fidelity simulations required to hydrodynamically characterize the complex phenomena that occur in the case of waterjets, can enable the identification of non-intuitive design improvements over a wider design space that may be missed by traditional methods. In particular, the Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations are used to provide accurate performance predictions, capturing complex flow phenomena such as secondary flows (i.e., leakage vortices) and pressure distributions critical to waterjet design, of systematically varied configurations using a 42-dimensional parametric model. Simplified key performance indicators, in the specific cavitation inception obtained from the non-cavitating analysis, work in conjunction with the calculated hydraulic efficiency to identify geometries capable of improving (or not worsening) efficiency while postponing cavitation. The systematic and automated analysis of thousands of different configurations, iteratively modified by a genetic algorithm, is finally able to identify better waterjets, whose performances are confirmed by dedicated cavitating RANSE analyses. This demonstrates how RANS-based simulations, integrated with optimization algorithms, can lead to superior axial waterjet designs, providing a flexible, more robust, and effective methodology compared to conventional approaches.",

      "abstract": "Marine propellers often function under uncertain conditions such as variable inflow, rate of revolution, and manufacturing tolerances. A deterministic design approach may result in excessive sensitivity to minor variations, leading to suboptimal performance in real-world scenarios. Then, quantifying these uncertainties, and leveraging their influence on propeller performance, is of fundamental importance to design and optimizing configurations less sensitive to input variations. In the context of a “robust” design of marine propellers through simulation-based design optimization methodologies, this paper explores both deterministic and non-deterministic design approaches for a conventional propulsor, accounting for the uncertainties in the nominal operating conditions. Since the quantification of uncertainties can be computationally very intensive, an efficient medium-fidelity Boundary Element Method (BEM) solver using equivalent steady-state cavitating analyses is employed in the optimization process. The optimal designs are finally validated through fully unsteady and cavitating BEM and RANSE calculations to demonstrate the advantages of the non-deterministic design approach.",

      "abstract": "Design-space dimensionality reduction is essential to mitigate the cost of high-fidelity simulation-based optimization, especially when dealing with high-dimensional geometric parameterizations. Traditional linear techniques, such as principal component analysis, are widely used but often neglect the physical response of the system and lack invertibility to the design space, i.e., the ability to reconstruct the original design parameters from a reduced representation. This work introduces two physics-aware extensions of the parametric model embedding (PME) framework, aimed at generating reduced representations that incorporate physical information while maintaining analytical backmapping. The first, physics-informed PME (PI-PME), combines geometric and physical variability; the second, physics-driven PME (PD-PME), relies solely on physical responses. The proposed methods enable the construction of interpretable and physically relevant reduced spaces that can be used for design-space exploration, surrogate modeling, and optimization. The approach is demonstrated on multiple engineering configurations, including airfoils, propellers, gliders, and hulls, showing its ability to capture performance-relevant directions and preserve parametric consistency. The methodology is offline and non-intrusive, compatible with low-fidelity simulations, and requires only a modest number of samples to ensure variance convergence.",

Steady-state (moving reference frame plus mixing plane interface) and unsteady simulations (sliding meshes) with fully resolved rotor geometry were finally carried out on six selected optimal geometries to validate the optimization process and the performance improvements provided by the RDPJ configuration when compared with the original rim-driven thruster (RDT).",

      "abstract": "During the early design stage of an underwater vehicle, the correct assessment of its manoeuvrability is a crucial task. Conducting experimental tests still has high costs, especially when dealing with small vehicles characterized by low available budget. In the current investigation, virtual towing tank tests are simulated using the open-source OpenFOAM library in order to assess the reliability of CFD methods for the prediction of hydrodynamic forces and moments. A well-known case study, the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) SUB-OFF model, is used, and the outcomes are compared to the experimental results available in the literature. Five different configurations are investigated for pure drift tests, rudder tests and pure rotation in both vertical and horizontal plane. The results show an overall good agreement with the experimental data with a quite low demanding mesh arrangement of 3M cells, a favourable balance between accuracy and computational time. In more detail, the expected error in the most significant forces during manoeuvres is less than 2% for the fully appended configuration (the submarine real operative condition), whereas the accuracy is moderately reduced for the barehull configuration (a case not representative of a real hull) with an expected error of 15%. A possible reason for the differences observed could be attributed to the description of the two streamwise vortices generated when manoeuvring. Apart from the lateral force and yaw moment, the results of the longitudinal force are also presented, having a greater disparity when compared to the experimental data. Nevertheless, the longitudinal force has no important role for the purpose of making stability and control predictions. The study contributes to the validation and consolidation of CFD methods, offering insights into their accuracy and limitations for practical applications in underwater vehicles.",

      "abstract": "In the context of numerical self-propulsion predictions, the literature on high-speed marine vehicles (HSMV) is still relatively scarce. Actually, extensive numerical analyses are rarely considered for these applications because of the not-so-stringent design constraints and contract requirements concerning these crafts and also thanks to the advantages of series production. On the contrary, with the growth of the market requests, in particular, in the direction of Greenhouse Gas Reduction, the exact knowledge of the vessel working point, in terms of speed and engine configuration, pushes the researchers to investigate all the factors which deeply define the propulsion condition. In the present paper, two existing vessels have been numerically studied using a robust and industrially affordable procedure based on some simplified viscous Computational Fluid Dynamic approaches to predict the self-propulsion working points. The obtained results have been then compared with available sea trials showing a very high agreement even if some uncertainties in both the experimental measurements and the CFD results still exist. The impact of these uncertainties has been further investigated to assess the reliability of the self-propulsion prediction, showing that the maximum speed can be obtained with an uncertainty of about 1 knot and 10% of the corresponding engine load. A more robust prediction can be obtained by including the uncertainty assessment in the propulsion analyses. The validity of the proposed analyses is further supported because the numerical uncertainty falls inside the uncertainty obtained from the available full-scale measurements, so defining a more robust prediction of the vessel propulsion point for design purposes.",

Measurements have been carried out on a scaled model of a propeller in the cavitation tunnel of UNIGE using Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) and the acquired data have been post-processed applying the ensemble average technique. The propeller configuration includes shaft appendages as in a typical twin screw vessel configuration. The tests have been performed also without propeller, considering different velocities, in order to characterize the incoming flow field and analyse possible effects on propeller flow. The complete 3-D flow field has been measured considering four transverse sections at different longitudinal locations, from upstream to downstream of the propeller, focusing on the near field wake. A longitudinal plane containing the propeller shaft has been considered as well. A dedicated interpolation technique is presented to improve the spatial resolution of data and allow advanced analyses. Results allow analysing the main characteristics of the flow field, including the evolution of its main structures. The effects of non uniform inflow conditions caused by the oblique flow are analysed focusing on the dynamics of vortexes and in particular on the trajectories and strength of the vortexes.",

      "abstract": "In the current paper, high-fidelity improved delayed detached-eddy simulations (IDDES) using the OpenFOAM library are employed to characterize the performances and the wake dynamics of RIM-driven thrusters. Despite their relatively old conception, this type of propulsors has gained attention only recently thanks to innovative manufacturing technologies and materials, which finally have made possible their practical implementation. Fostered by stringent regulations on radiated noise and emissions enforced in protected areas, they are also replacing conventional thrusters and main propulsors. By mitigating the tip vortex cavitation and, more in general, by reducing the strength of tip vortices, indeed, these propulsors may grant a reduction in the induced pressure pulses and of the radiated noise without excessively sacrificing the efficiency of the equivalent ducted propellers they replace. To provide proof of this, three different RIM-driven thrusters (one four-bladed, two six-bladed) are analyzed and compared to a reference decelerating ducted propeller delivering the same thrust at identical functioning conditions. The evolution of the trailing wakes of the propulsors, the role of the leakage vortex, and the nozzle wake destabilizing effects, are highlighted, and the superior performances of RIM-driven thrusters, in terms of less intense tip vortices, are discussed. Near-field pressure pulses, as a measure of the radiated noise, are compared, showing a reduction in the sound pressure levels of the selected RIM propulsors up to 15 dB (non-cavitating case) with respect to the reference ducted propeller.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, after the successful applications to open water propeller performance estimations, the influence of transition sensitive and modified mass transfer models tuned to account for the laminar flow in the prediction of the cavitation inception of marine propulsors is investigated from the point of view of the unsteady functioning and induced pressure pulses. The VP1304 (also known as PPTC) test case, for which dedicated data were collected during several workshops, is considered first. After preliminary analyses using RANS, also Detached Eddy Simulations (DES) are included to better account for the vortex dynamics and its influence on pressure pulses. Similarly to what observed in uniform inflow, results show a better agreement with the available measurements of propeller performances and confirm the reliability of the proposed approaches for unsteady, non-cavitating, model scale propeller predictions. The overall cavitation pattern is improved too by the application of the transition sensitive correction to the mass transfer model, but the complex dynamics of bubble cavitation observed in experiments prevents quantitatively better predictions in terms of thrust/torque breakdown and induced pressure pulses levels regardless the use of RANS or DES methods.",

To this aim, a simulation-based design optimization method, combining RANSE analyses (ship resistance) with BEM calculations (unsteady propeller performances) in a simplified optimization process realized through a parametric description of ESD geometries, was employed. Fully resolved RANSE analyses were used to validate the outcomes of this affordable design process, which identifies devices capable of saving energy in the delivered power for this type of challenging test case by up to 2.6%.

      "abstract": "For propeller-driven vessels, cavitation is the most dominant noise source producing both structure-borne and radiated noise impacting wildlife, passenger comfort, and underwater warfare. Physically plausible and accurate predictions of the underwater radiated noise at design stage, i.e., for previously untested geometries and operating conditions, are fundamental for designing silent and efficient propellers. State-of-the-art predictive models are based on physical, data-driven, and hybrid approaches. Physical models (PMs) meet the need for physically plausible predictions but are either too computationally demanding or not accurate enough at design stage. Data-driven models (DDMs) are computationally inexpensive ad accurate on average but sometimes produce physically implausible results. Hybrid models (HMs) combine PMs and DDMs trying to take advantage of their strengths while limiting their weaknesses but state-of-the-art hybridisation strategies do not actually blend them, failing to achieve the HMs full potential. In this work, for the first time, we propose a novel HM that recursively correct a state-of-the-art PM by means of a DDM which simultaneously exploits the prior physical knowledge in the definition of its feature set and the data coming from a vast experimental campaign at the Emerson Cavitation Tunnel on the Meridian standard propeller series behind different severities of the axial wake. Results in different extrapolating conditions, i.e., extrapolation with respect to propeller rotational speed, wakefield, and geometry, will support our proposal both in terms of accuracy and physical plausibility.",

      "abstract": "Tip loading is a common strategy to increase the propulsive efficiency of propellers. Solutions such as contracted and tip-loaded (CLT) and “New generation” CLT propellers exploit the presence of an endplate (“true” or as the result of a dedicated modification of the rake distribution) to sustain the increased load at the tip of the blade, at the cost of more complex vortical structures. Their evolution, and the mutual interaction of secondary vortices originated by the endplate itself, however, has not been completely and deeply investigated. The current paper addresses this topic by improved delayed detached eddy simulations (IDDES) of the flow field around two propellers of this type at different loading conditions. The presence of secondary vortices from the endplate root (or from the bended blade at tip), partially observed in recent experiments, is evidenced by high-fidelity CFD calculations. The interaction mechanism with the primary vortices (those from the endplate tip), and the resulting strengthening of the vortical structures, also through the interaction with the blade trailing vortical wake that promote the leapfrogging phenomenon, is discussed as well, comparing the phenomena in the case of two optimally designed geometries (a CLT and a New Generation CLT propeller) exploiting the same pressure side tip-loading concept in a slightly different way. Results show a rather different instability mechanism depending on the endplate configuration and open the discussion on the effectiveness of splitting a single tip vortex into pairs of vortical structures that may induce similar (or even worse) side effects in terms of pressure minima in the wake and earlier wake destabilization.",

      "abstract": "The potential impact of underwater radiated noise from maritime operations on marine fauna has become an important issue. The most dominant noise source on a propeller-driven vessel is propeller cavitation, producing both structure-borne and radiated noise, with a broad spectrum that covers a wide range of frequencies. To ensure acceptable noise levels for sustainable shipping, accurate prediction of the noise signature is essential, and procedures able to provide a reliable estimate of propeller cavitation noise are becoming a fundamental tool of the design process. In this work, we investigate the potential of using computationally cheap methods for the prediction of underwater radiated noise from cavitating marine propellers. We compare computational and experimental results on a subset of the Meridian standard propeller series, behind different severities of axial wake, for a total of 432 experiments. The results indicate that the approaches employed can be a convenient solution for noise analysis during the design process.",

      "abstract": "Sailing at snorkel depth is a necessary but dangerous operating scenario for submarines. The main and straightforward reason is that such an operating condition represents a time of possible vulnerability of the vessel. From a design perspective this condition affects the so-called indiscretion rate, that is exactly the ratio between this time of greater vulnerability and the total operating time. Moreover, when the vessel operates at snorkel depths there are some relevant operations that might be accomplished related to both snorkeling, communications and threats detection. These operations are typically carried out by using a certain number of masts, of slightly different shapes and sizes, that might be used in various configurations. The proposed study aims at providing some insights into the unsteady, turbulent, hydrodynamics of several submarine masts configurations. The analysis is carried out in terms of behaviors of the developed free surface, considering the nonlinear interactions rising among the masts considered. The maximum height and length of the breaking wave generated at the bow of each mast is analyzed. Both the near field and the far field unsteady wave patterns are discussed comparing several configurations and focusing on the interaction effects. The computational study is carried out by using an open-source Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamic solver called DualSPHysics, able to exploit the computational acceleration provided by GP-GPU cards.",

      "abstract": "The paper explores the accuracy of a low-cost CFD based approach to evaluate the propeller load variation experienced during manoeuvring conditions. The proposed procedure is based on the inclusion, in the ship hydrodynamic analyses by RANS, of the propeller effect through a body-force approach calibrated on BEM calculation to realize a computationally efficient method. Numerical results have been compared with the literature available experimental data performed on the well-known DTMB5415 benchmark test case, where the thrusts experienced by both of her propellers during dedicated Captive Model Tests were recorded. Both pure drift and pure yaw tests have been considered in the numerical campaign to cover the entire kinematic conditions involved during standard IMO manoeuvres. To prove the effectiveness of the method, also a severe turning circle condition is evaluated. The comparison shows the maturity of these numerical calculations, even if based on a simplified approach, to correctly evaluate the propeller unbalance, opening the way to the application of the proposed method to investigate the causes of load variations in manoeuvre conditions and directly in manoeuvre simulations.",

      "abstract": "Submarines bring many interesting hydrodynamic challenges that need to be properly addressed to provide precise and reliable information about their performance. Hydrodynamic performance must be evaluated at least in two main operating conditions, namely when it is deeply submerged and at snorkel depth. There are relevant differences in terms of hydrodynamic since the forward speed in the latter condition is typically much lower and of interaction with the free surface. Moreover, submarines used to sail at snorkel depth if they need to accomplish specific tasks, such as communication, that involves the use of surface piercing masts. The proposed study analyses the opportunity provided by different Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) approaches to correctly address submarine performance. The resistance in both conditions, masts free surface hydrodynamics and maneuvering behaviors are addressed. Ad-hoc approaches based on in-house developed numerical procedures and open-source software are presented. Different CFD techniques have been used, including Reynolds Averaged Navire Stokes (RANS), Detached Eddy Simulation (DES) and Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), according to the particular physics that need to be studied.",

      "abstract": "A Simulation Based Design Optimization method for marine propellers design using a two-fidelity levels metamodel for global design space exploration and optimization is presented. Response surfaces are built using the co-Kriging approximation, i.e. a multi-output Gaussian process that combines large low-fidelity dataset with few, costly, high-fidelity data. The method is applied for the hydrodynamic shape optimization of the E779A propeller using, as fidelity levels, two different physical models for the propeller performances prediction, namely an inviscid, potential based Boundary Element Method (low-fidelity) and a viscous, finite volume RANS solver (high-fidelity). Results demonstrate the feasibility of multi-objective, constrained, design procedures, like those involving marine propellers, using these multi-fidelity response surfaces. At the same time, the need of good correlations between low- and high-fidelity data feeding the response surfaces is highlighted as a requisite for robust and reliable predictions using these approximated methods.",

      "abstract": "The hydrodynamics of surface piercing struts and pile-like structures in general presents some very complex fluid dynamics phenomena that are worth investigating. Among them there are the forward wave pile-up at stagnation, the wave breaking with flow reversal like that observed in Bidone-type hydraulic jumps, flow separation caused by interactions of steep free-surface waves and the turbulent wall boundary layer. Such a type of flow structures plays a key role in several engineering applications, ranging from naval architecture to civil and ocean engineering. The hydrodynamic analysis of different surface-piercing struts in tandem configuration has been done in the framework of a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamic approach available through the open-source software DualSPHysics, developed to exploit the GP-GPU architecture to speed up the computation. A numerical wave tank has been set-up to carry out calm water tests. Beyond the influence of the forward speed, the analysis has focused on the effect of three main geometric parameters establishing the configuration: the longitudinal and the lateral distance among the vertical, surface-piercing, struts and the relative size among them. The mean and the rms values of the unsteady near-field free surface elevation have been analyzed and compared among the selected cases and interaction effects are studied in comparison to the free surface obtained for the equivalent single strut configuration.",

To this aim, BEM and RANSE calculations are employed. Depending on the application, a simple actuator disc model (post-swirl) with radially varying load or a combined BEM/RANSE method for self-propulsion prediction (pre-swirl) are required. Both the approaches are included in a framework for a design by optimization, where systematic variations of the ESD geometry are used to explore the design space and maximize the energy-saving effect of the devices. Considering the particularity of the case selected for the study, results show encouraging improvements that reach a promising 5% in the case of the combined action of both devices.",

In the previous study, the application of the γ-Re<inf>θ</inf> Local Correlation Transition Model allowed for significant improvements in model scale performance prediction and highlighted the role of the turbulence intensity on the transition onset. In this second part of the study, the influence of the same transition model on the inception and development of cavitation is considered. To this aim, a modification of the Schnerr-Sauer mass transfer model, useful for engineering-oriented applications, is proposed to account for the role of the laminar boundary layer in the inception and development of the leading edge sheet cavitation. The proposed analyses, compared with the available measurements at the cavitation tunnel, confirm the improvements of the numerical predictions using the modified model.",

      "abstract": "A method for the morphing of surface/volume meshes suitable to be used in hydrodynamic shape optimization is proposed. Built in the OpenFOAM environment, it relies on a Laplace equation that propagates the modifications of the surface boundaries, realized by applying a free-form deformation to a subdivision surface description of the geometry, into the computational volume mesh initially built through a combination of BlockMesh with cfMesh. The feasibility and robustness of this mesh morphing technique, used as a computationally efficient pre-processing tool, is demonstrated in the case of the resistance minimization of the DTC hull. All the hull variations generated within a relatively large design space are efficiently and successfully realized, i.e., without mesh inconsistencies and quality issues, only by deforming the initial mesh of the reference geometry. Coupled with a surrogate model approach, a significant reduction in the calm water resistance, in the extent of 10%, has been achieved in a reasonable computational time.",

The tool relies on RANS analyses of parametrically described geometries driven by an automatic, multi-objective optimization loop for the design of propellers with improved performances simultaneously in terms of both propulsive efficiency and cavitation inception. Pareto convergence is achieved by using a mix of fully resolved RANS analyses and surrogate models aimed at significantly improving the computational efficiency of the procedure. The effectiveness of the design approach is verified by comparing the devised RIM propellers with the performance of a reference ducted propeller at the same functioning point while design trends and guidelines are extracted from the analysis of the amount of data collected during the optimization process.",

      "abstract": "The interest in Energy Saving Devices (ESD) has grown significantly during the last years. Recent regulations, like the IMO EEOI (Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator) and EEDI (Energy Efficiency Design Index), impose further restrictions on emissions for both new designs and existing vessels. Moreover, these regulations encourage the development and the application of efficient, unconventional, propulsive solutions to fulfil these new requirements. The paper presents a design approach, based on the paradigm of optimization applied to Propeller Boss Cap Fin (PBCF) energy saving devices for ducted propellers. PBCF, indeed, were extensively studied in the case of conventional propellers, but nowadays there are only very few researches regarding the combination of these devices with unconventional propulsors, such as ducted propellers. Since the particular functioning of propellers inside nozzles can influence significantly the entire flow field aft the propeller, normally exploited by the PBCF for energy losses recovery, ad-hoc design procedures are required. By using a combination of RANSE analyses, a parametric description of the PBCF blade and an optimization algorithm, the paper illustrates the results of the design of PBCFs for propellers operating both in accelerating and decelerating nozzles, discussing the effectiveness of such kind of devices in case of ducted propellers.",

      "abstract": "The representation and the variation of hull shapes are two challenging problems in naval architecture due to the complexity of the geometry and to the need to ensure the fairness of the surfaces. Conventional CAD techniques are widely used to accurately describe the hull shape. However, they are rather complex to be easily used to generate hull shape variations due to the great number of variables involved. We propose a study to highlight the pro and cons of the application of space reduction techniques, usually referred to as Reduced Order Models (ROMs), to create a parametric model for both global and local hull shape variations. A geometric transformation relying on the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) method is applied on top of a combined subdivision surface — Free Form Deformation (FFD) approach conceived for modeling and variation of hull shapes. The analysis focuses on highlighting the geometric meaning of the new POD basis functions and on how this model affects the variability of the explored design space. Two studies are developed in order to show possible applications of this technique. In the first one a new set of selection criteria for the POD modes based on geometric considerations are proposed to use it on uncorrelated geometric domains. In the latter the large-dimensional space of the so-called Design Velocities (DV), related to the shape sensitivity, is reduced by using the POD approach to create a new transformation of the hull shape.",

      "abstract": "The importance of reducing the noise impact of ships is being recognised worldwide. Consequently, the inclusion of this principle among the objectives and constraints of new designs is becoming a standard. For this reason, considerable attention is given to the propeller being often the dominant source of underwater radiated noise, especially when cavitation occurs, as it happens in most cases when a ship sails at design speed. The designers of quieter propulsion systems require the availability of predictive tools able to verify the compliance with noise requirements and to compare the effectiveness of different design solutions. In this context, tools able to provide a reliable estimate of propeller noise spectra based just on the information available during propeller design represent a fundamental tool to speed up the design process avoiding model scale tests. This work focuses on developing a tool able to predict the cavitating marine propeller generated noise spectra at design stage exploiting the most recent advances in Deep Learning, able to take advantage of both structured and unstructured data, and in hybrid modelling, able to exploit both data and physical knowledge about the problem. For this purpose authors will make use of a dataset collected by means of dedicated model scale measurements in a cavitation tunnel combined with the detailed flow characterisation obtainable by calculations carried out with a Boundary Element Method. The performance of the proposed approaches are analysed considering different scenarios and different definitions of the input and output variable used during the modelisation.",

      "abstract": "Ducted propellers are unconventional systems that are usually adopted for ship propulsion. These devices have recently been studied with medium-fidelity computational fluid dynamics code (based on the potential flow hypothesis) with promising results. However, these tools, even though they provide a good prediction of the forces and moments generated by the blades and the duct, are not able to provide insight into the flow field characteristics due to their crude flow approximations. On the contrary, modern high-fidelity viscous-based computational fluid dynamics codes could give a better description of the near and far-field flow of these particular devices. In the present paper, forces and the most significant features of the flow field around two ducted propellers are analyzed by means of both experimental and computational fluid dynamics approaches. In particular, accelerating and decelerating ducts are considered, and we demonstrate the ability of the adopted solver to accurately predict the performance and the flow field for both types. These results, in particular for the less-studied decelerating duct, designate CFD as a useful tool for reliable designs.",

      "abstract": "We propose a Simulation-Based Design Optimization (SBDO) approach for the design of an Energy Saving Device (ESD) based on the Wake Equalizing Duct (WED) concept. Pre-Ducts, like Wake Equalizing Ducts, reduce the wake losses, improve the propeller-hull interaction and generate an additional thrust. An integrated design approach, relying on a parametric description of the duct geometry of the WEDs and on a RANSE method, managed by a global convergence optimization algorithm, is developed to maximize the delivered thrust. The Japan Bulk Carrier (JBC) test case, for which model scale experimental data on the effectiveness of the WED are available in the literature, is considered as a baseline. Results obtained by using the adaptive, fully automated proposed design framework highlight significant improvements of the overall propulsive efficiency when the Pre-Duct design is tailored to the actual hull wake shape. In addition, off-design conditions are considered to verify the robustness of the proposed designs with respect to variations of the working point and discuss the opportunity of a robust optimization process.",

      "abstract": "Modern paradigms to design complex engineering systems focus on interactive approaches able to simultaneously handle results from multidisciplinary applications. Keeping this in mind and considering that from a ship design perspective the definition of a hull shape is the first step of the whole design process, a reliable computer aided design model for shape representation and morphing becomes a key feature to navigate trough the design spiral. The proposed research focuses on the comparison of two different approaches to handle hull shape variations, namely the fully parametric model and a non-parametric method relying on the free form deformation technique. The comparison is developed considering both the easiness of building the shape of the reference model with its transformations laws and the resulting number of free design variables. The two methods are analyzed in the light of attainable hull shape variation in two design and modification test cases. The first is limited to the bulbous bow of a conventional hull while the second focuses on the whole surface of a fast, displacement, round-bilge hull.",

The effectiveness of the proposed approach is proven in the case of the INSEAN-E779A propeller, which blade shape is modified to maximise efficiency while reducing suction side cavitation. The 23-dimensions design space defined by the conventional shape representation is reduced by the POD method to 5, 12 and 15 dimensions, retaining up to the 98% of the geometric variance of the original space. A multi-objective optimisation algorithm drives the simulation-based design optimisation (SBDO) process in the new design spaces using BEM for the hydrodynamic predictions. Finally, optimal designs are verified using RANSE to assess the correlation between the performance improvements, the dimensionality reduction and the corresponding geometric variance. The effectiveness of the proposed POD-SBDO framework is discussed with respect to a design by optimisation process relying on the conventional parametric representation of the blade geometry.",

      "abstract": "A simulation-based design optimization (SBDO) tool is proposed for the design of rim driven thrusters. The optimization framework consists of a parametric description of the rim blade geometry and a multi-objective optimization algorithm which makes use of the results from high-fidelity RANS calculations to drive the choice towards optimal blade shapes. Maximization of the propulsive efficiency and minimization of cavitation, monitored through the simplest cavitation inception criterion based on the analysis of the non-cavitating pressure distribution over the blade, are the contrasting objectives selected for the design. A constraint on the delivered thrust fixes the functioning condition of the devised propellers. Four distinct design runs, changing the number of blades, from three to six, are considered. The reference performance are those of a ducted propeller operating in a decelerating nozzle which is exactly used in the case of rim configuration. Results of the optimizations prove the flexibility and the reliability of the SBDO framework in dealing with unconventional configurations. A generalized reduction of the risk of cavitation is observed regardless the number of blades; five- and six-bladed propulsors ensure remarkable (about 40%) higher margins with respect to any (leading edge and midchord) cavitating phenomena at the cost only of a slight reduction of efficiency. Also, the structure of the tip vortexes results significantly modified.",

      "abstract": "Achieving a reliable and accurate numerical prediction of the self-propulsion performance of a ship is still an open problem that poses some relevant issues. Several CFD methods, ranging from boundary element methods (BEM) to higher-fidelity viscous Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) based solvers, can be used to accurately analyze the separate problems, i.e. the open water propeller and the hull calm water resistance. However, when the fully-coupled self-propulsion problem is considered, i.e. the hull advancing at uniform speed propelled by its own propulsion system, several complexities rise up. Typical flow simplifications adopted to speed-up the simulations of the single analysis (hull and propeller separately) lose their validity requiring a more complex solver to tackle the fully-coupled problem. The complexity rises up further when considering a maneuver condition. This aspect increases the computational burden and, consequently, the required time which becomes prohibitive in a preliminary ship design stage. The majority of the simplified methods proposed in literature to include propeller effects, without directly solve the propeller flow, in a high-fidelity viscous solver are not able to provide all the commonly required self-propulsion coefficients. In this work, a new method to enrich the results from a body force based approach is proposed and investigated, with the aim to reduce as much as possible the computational burden without losing any useful result. This procedure is tested for validation on the KCS hull form in self-propulsion and maneuver conditions.",

      "abstract": "In the context of the low speed and high drift angles manoeuvres, a limited number of experimental test cases are available in open literature. Consequently, the ability to reliably predict the hull forces (and the related hydrodynamic coefficients) via computational fluid dynamics calculations may represent a significant added value to further tune or to generate new simplified hull forces models to be employed in a manoeuvring code. Even if some applications can be found in the literature for selected cases and conditions, as those considered in the present work, a more systematic comparison is mandatory to confirm the reliability of these numerical approaches. In light of this, in the present work a systematic application of the open-source viscous-based flow solver OpenFOAM to predict forces at low-speed manoeuvring conditions for two ship test cases (the KCS and the KVLCC) is presented. The proposed numerical setup, specifically designed to be applied in the early ship design stage (limiting computational effort), shows a satisfactory accuracy to cope with the strong off-design conditions related to these specific ship operative conditions.",

      "abstract": "A computational framework for hydrodynamic shape optimization of complex ship hull form is proposed and applied to improve the calm water performance of the KRISO Container Ship (KCS). The framework relies on three key features: a novel shape morphing method based on a combination of subdivision surfaces and free form deformations, a robust three dimensional viscous computational fluid dynamic solver based on the openFOAM open-source libraries and a Gaussian process-response surface method (GP-RSM) based on ordinary Kriging model which has been created to speed-up the evaluation of the quantity of interest (QoI) of the design process. The accuracy of the hydrodynamic solver is proven by comparing the obtained results against available experimental measurements. A preliminary sensitivity analysis on the mesh size has been carried out aiming at reducing the computational burden required by the CFD predictions. Three GP-RSMs have been trained relying on increasing number of hull designs. Each surrogate model has been cross-validated by both leave-one-out and k-fold techniques. The behaviours of these multi-dimensional surfaces have been analyzed in details by sampling the investigated design space with 10<sup>7</sup> points according to a Full-Factorial algorithm, highlighting the regions of maximum deviation with respect to the resistance of the reference hull. The three optimum designs provided by the corresponding GP-RSM models have been verified by using high-fidelity CFD simulations with a refined mesh configuration. Calm water resistance, wave patterns and pressure distributions over the selected hull surfaces have been discussed in the light of the generated shape variations.",

      "abstract": "In adverse situations, such as maneuvering and motion in waves, severe variations of the propeller inflow may be experienced, resulting in an increase of propeller thrust and torque and in the generation of in-plane loads. This may cause undesired hull-vibratory loads, stress of the propulsive system and even affect somehow the ship dynamic response. Thus, a reliable prediction of these phenomena during design phases is necessary to comply with the increasingly stringent constraints on safety at sea, propulsive efficiency, vibration and noise pollution. In the present work, the capabilities of a propeller solver based on a potential, boundary element method, routinely used in the optimization process of the propulsive device, to analyze the propeller performance under different maneuvering conditions are considered. After a first validation against uRANS simulations considering a simple oblique flow, the analysis is broadened to a propeller operating in the wake field of a twin screw ship in different maneuvering conditions, for which experimental results from free running tests in model scale are available. The BEM solver is compared also to a steady blade element approach in order to achieve an overview of the respective pros and cons in view of their inclusion in CFD simulations.",

      "abstract": "Propeller optimisation is always the focus of the propeller design process, as such process is aimed at finding the best compromise between often conflicting objectives accounting for many design constraints. The use of optimization algorithms combined with blade shape modification techniques has been proposed by a number of research groups in the past few years and has proved to have a potential for practical applications, but integration in the everyday propeller design process is still beyond to be so consolidated. In the past one and a half year, CETENA, University of Genoa and the Fincantieri’s Naval Vessels Business unit have teamed to set up a propeller optimization software environment to be used by Fincantieri’s propeller designers in their everyday design work. A specification of the optimisation environment was worked out based on an analysis of the current design process, in order for the new procedures and tools to allow continuity of current practices while offering new possibilities in the comparative investigation of design variants and the identification of the very best design solution. The resulting optimisation environment integrates different software tools and consists of three main components linked by JAVA script architecture: a software tool for blade shape modification and definition (1), a BEM code for the evaluation of the propeller performance (2) and the open-source software DAKOTA to guide the optimisation (3). The software suite has been setup such as to be compatible with both Windows and Linux operating systems, in order to take advantage of all available computational resources, from single Windows workstations to the company’s cluster, which operates under Linux. An ad-hoc ‘2D modeler’ has been developed by the University of Genoa to model and modify the propeller design table, while a 3D modeller has been developed by CETENA to generate the 3D propeller description suitable for CFD RANS computations, starting from the 2D propeller design curves. The propeller performance is evaluated using CRS BEM code PROCAL and the CRS Empirical Tip Vortex model. Measures of merit usually include: the propeller efficiency, pressure coefficients at specific locations on the blade back and face sides and, for an hydro-acoustic optimization, also the tip vortex induced pressure. The paper will provide details of the setup of the optimization environment focusing on an industrial application to design by optimization a naval propeller. The specific needs of the final users of the optimization suite will be highlighted and the expected benefits will be discussed, related to the time frame of the design process and the possibility of performing thorough investigations of design variants.",

In the last years, most of the attention has been devoted to the efficient coupling with electric motors, since only recently the development of permanent magnets allowed for the successful embedding of the driver directly inside the surrounding duct. From the hydrodynamic point of view, however, analysis and, in particular, design strategies are not yet ripe. In the light of the development of advanced design approaches for unconventional geometries, we propose a Simulation-Based Design Optimization tool based on RANS analyses of parametrically described geometries as a part of an automatic, multi-objective optimization loop. The SBDO is used to design a RIM driven propeller with an accelerating type duct, with improved performance simultaneously in terms both of efficiency and cavitation inception at different (design and quasi-bollard pull) functioning conditions.",

      "abstract": "The multi-fidelity machine learning framework proposed in this paper leverages a probabilistic approach based on Gaussian Process modeling for the formulation of stochastic response surfaces capable of describing propeller performance for different mission profiles. The proposed multi-fidelity techniques will help coping with the scarcity of high-fidelity measurements by using lower-fidelity numerical predictions. The existing correlation of the multi-fidelity data sets is used to infer high-fidelity measurements from lower fidelity numerical predictions. The probabilistic formulations embedded in Gaussian Process regressions gives the unique opportunity to learn the target functions describing propeller performance at different operating conditions, while quantifying the uncertainty associated to that specific prediction. While the multi-fidelity autoregressive scheme allows to construct high accurate response surfaces using only few experimental data, Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) provides an important metric to asses the quality of the learning process. We demonstrate the capability of the proposed framework to predict the performance of a controllable pitch propeller using few experimental data coming from towing tank experiments and many medium-fidelity predictions obtained using an in-house developed BEM, validated and verified in many previous studies.",

RANS Equations, solved by using the OpenFOAM library, are applied in an automatic design approach involving a parametric description of the main characteristics of PBCFs and an optimization algorithm. The optimization is carried out with multiple purposes: identify a reliable design strategy necessary to customize the PBCF geometry based on the propeller functioning and, by exploiting the systematic calculations carried out in the framework of the optimization, evaluate the influence of alternative configurations and of main geometrical parameters in achieving higher efficiency. The use of high-fidelity RANS calculations allows confirming the decrease of the hub vortex strength, the reduction of the net torque and the influence of the additional fins on blades performance as the major contributors to the increase of efficiency. Results of detailed analyses of optimal PBCF configurations show model scale increases of efficiency of about 1%, which can reach the outstanding value of 4% in the case of a rather unrefined propeller design.",

      "abstract": "Correct evaluation of rudder performance is a key issue in assessing ship maneuverability. This paper presents a simplified approach based on a viscous flow solver to address propeller and rudder interactions. Viscous flow solvers have been applied to this type of problems, but the large computational requests limit (or even prevent) their application at a preliminary ship design stage. Based on this idea, a simplified approach to include the propeller effect in front of the rudder is considered to speed up the solution. Based on the concept of body forces, this approach enables sufficiently fast computation for a preliminary ship design stage, thereby maintaining its reliability. To define the limitations of the proposed procedure, an extensive analysis of the simplified method is performed and the results are compared with experimental data presented in the literature. Initially, the reported results show the capability of the body-force approach to represent the inflow field to the rudder without the full description of the propeller, also with regard to the complex bollard pull condition. Consequently, the rudder forces are satisfactorily predicted at least with regard to the lift force. However, the drag force evaluation is more problematic and causes higher discrepancies. Nevertheless, these discrepancies may be accepted due to their lower influence on the overall ship maneuverability performance.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we present our analysis of the non-cavitating and cavitating unsteady performances of the Potsdam Propeller Test Case (PPTC) in oblique flow. For our calculations, we used the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equation (RANSE) solver from the open-source OpenFOAM libraries. We selected the homogeneous mixture approach to solve for multiphase flow with phase change, using the volume of fluid (VoF) approach to solve the multiphase flow and modeling the mass transfer between vapor and water with the Schnerr-Sauer model. Comparing the model results with the experimental measurements collected during the Second Workshop on Cavitation and Propeller Performance – SMP’15 enabled our assessment of the reliability of the open-source calculations. Comparisons with the numerical data collected during the workshop enabled further analysis of the reliability of different flow solvers from which we produced an overview of recommended guidelines (mesh arrangements and solver setups) for accurate numerical prediction even in off-design conditions. Lastly, we propose a number of calculations using the boundary element method developed at the University of Genoa for assessing the reliability of this dated but still widely adopted approach for design and optimization in the preliminary stages of very demanding test cases.",

      "abstract": "Most of the traditional procedures for the design of conventional propellers do not yield reliable outcomes in the case of unconventional propellers, for which high-fidelity predictions of performance characteristics are necessary. It is generally understood and recognized, for instance, that the standard ITTC'78 procedure for model to full-scale extrapolation of performance is not reliable in case of unconventional propellers. CFD calculations, on the other hand, are becoming a standard analysis tool to be used for unconventional propeller design and performance predictions. In the present paper, it will be shown, for both a CLT and a new generation CLT propellers, that the extrapolation from model tests to full-scale cannot be reliably carried out by standard procedures. A CFD calculations campaign is, consequently, carried out to simulate the performance of both designs in open water condition, both at model and full-scale, incorporating transition models to determine with more detail laminar, transitional and turbulent flow areas. Results are also compared with the performance predictions obtained with empirical and strip method scaling procedures developed by SISTEMAR S.A. The comparison shows that both methods are sufficiency reliable in the early design stage and for the extrapolation and comparison of model tests.",

      "abstract": "Classic hydrodynamics-related ship design problems can nowadays be approached by CFD viscous solvers. Ship self-propulsion performance prediction represents one of the most interesting problems in this framework. The capabilities of CFD codes to resolve accurately the separate problems (open water propeller performance and hull resistance) have been demonstrated over the last decades. The complexity of the combined problem (and, in turn, the required computational time) has restricted its solution to research applications still far from everyday industrial practice. Some approaches have been developed to reduce the computational burden, based e.g. on simple actuator-disk theory or, recently, on BEM/RANS coupled solvers. In this respect, different approaches exploiting the open-source solver Open-FOAM are presented, focusing on the main self-propulsion parameters. In addition, a new numerical strategy able to provide more information compared to classical simplified approaches, is herein presented and validated against experimental measurements on the well-known Kriso Container Ship (KCS) test case.",

      "abstract": "The effect of laminar to turbulent flow transition plays an important role for the prediction of model scale performance, which is of utmost interest for the development of scaling approaches entirely based on Computational Fluid Dynamics calculations. The recent inclusion of transition models (either based on local correlations, like the γ - Re θ, or on the concept of kinetic laminar energy, like the k - k L - ω) in many RANS codes fosters their application for improving the model scale prediction of propeller performance. In the present work the numerical results using the well-established SST k - ω and the k - k L - ω turbulence models available in OpenFOAM are presented and compared with towing tank experiments for three test case propellers. The influence of turbulence parameters (i.e. turbulence intensity and turbulent viscosity ratio at inlet) is discussed, at first for the ERCOFTAC T3A flat plate validation case, through which useful guidelines for propeller performance predictions using transition sensitive turbulence models are derived. By using these relationships, a significant improvement of numerical predictions of propeller forces is achieved, with discrepancies with respect to model scale measurements appreciably reduced if compared to usual fully turbulent calculations. At the same time the limitations of the adopted transitional model are discussed based on the systematic analyses carried out for three test cases.",

The need for silent and autonomous vehicles moved the attention of scientist in the employment of underwater gliders as well as wave gliders. The reduced dimensions and the relatively easy layout adaptation of such vehicles make them particularly suited for carrying out different missions. Each new maritime unmanned system (MUS) configuration has to be tested in order to characterize the vehicle self-noise and its interaction with the measured data. The low costs and the small dimensions often give the possibility of facing problems with a trial and error approach slightly changing the layout in order to suppress possible noise sources. In the present paper the low-frequency acoustic data, sampled from the hydrophones positioned on a volumetric array in the aft part of the towfish of a waveglider, were not usable due to significant self-noise. To identify the noise source, a systematic analysis of the initial configuration have been carried out in two different phases. At first, the acoustic as well as the motion data coming from sea trials have been processed in order to highlight the critical operative conditions. In the second part, CFD calculations presented in order to identify the unwanted self-noise sources. Finally, a possible improvement is suggested based on numerical CFD calculations.",

The optimization is carried out with multiple purposes: Identify a reliable design strategy necessary to customize the PBCF geometry based on the propeller functioning and evaluate the influence of alternative configurations and of main geometrical parameters in achieving higher efficiency. The use of high-fidelity RANS calculations confirm that the decrease of the hub vortex strength, the reduction of the net torque and the influence of the additional fins on blades performance are the major contributors to the increase of efficiency. Results of detailed analyses of optimal PBCF configurations show model scale increases of efficiency of about 1%.",

      "abstract": "Marine propellers design requirements are always more pressing and the application of unusual propulsive configurations, like ducted propellers with decelerating nozzles, may represent a valuable alternative to fulfill stringent design constraints. Accelerating duct configurations were realized mainly to increase the propeller efficiency in the case of highly-loaded functioning. The use of decelerating nozzles sustains the postponing of the cavitating phenomena that, in turn, reflects into a reduction of vibrations and radiated noise. The design of decelerating nozzle, unfortunately, is still challenging. The complex interaction between the propeller and the nozzle, both in terms of global flow feature and local (tip located) phenomena, is not yet fully understood. No extensive systematic series, as in the case of accelerating configurations, are available and the design still relies on few measurements and data. On the other hand, viscous flow solvers appear as reliable and accurate tools for the prediction of complex flow fields and their application for the calculation of ducted propeller performance and nozzle flow was almost successful. Hence, using CFD as a part of a design procedure based on optimization, by combining a parametric description of the geometry, a RANSE solver (OpenFOAM) and a genetic type algorithm (the modeFrontier optimization environment), is the obvious step towards an even more reliable ducted propeller design. An actuator disk model is adopted to include efficiently the influence of the propeller on the flow around the duct; this allows avoiding the weighting of the computational effort that is necessary for the calculations of the thousands of geometries needed for the indirect design by optimization. Design improvements, in model scale, are measured by comparing, by means of dedicated fully resolved RANSE calculations, the performance of the optimized geometries with those of conventional shapes available in literature. For both nozzle typologies, dedicated shapes reducing the risk of cavitation and increasing the delivered thrust are obtained, showing the opportunity of customized nozzle design out of usual systematic series. In addition, by analyzing the results of the optimization histories, appropriate design criteria are derived for both accelerating and decelerating nozzle shapes.",

      "abstract": "The paper deals with the self-propulsion problem, i.e. the solution of the flow around the hull that advances at uniform speed due to the action of its own propeller. A coupled BEM/RANS approach, previously proposed for a simpler case with only rudder and propeller, has been extensively analysed to highlight the strength and the weakness of the method. The proposed analyses consider the influence of different turbulence modelling, the role of the interpolating algorithm for the inclusion of body forces into the RANS domain, a mesh and simulation time step sensitivity study and the influence of the extrapolation procedure for the definition of the effective wake to the propeller in the light of the lightest and the most affordable computational setup for daily accurate calculations. At first, the well-known Kriso Container Ship (KCS) test case is considered. This ship has been widely investigated in the context of different research projects and a large amount of data (both measurements and numerical calculations) is available to validate the solution approach and to highlight the benefits, as well as the weaknesses, of the proposed coupled BEM/RANS approach versus established but computationally demanding calculations based only on RANS simulations. Once the approach has been developed and validated via the KCS test case, calculations have been repeated in the case of completely different ships, in order to evaluate its general applicability and to test the robustness and the reliability of the proposed procedure.",

      "abstract": "Accurate and reliable numerical predictions of propeller performance are a fundamental aspect for any analysis and design of a modern propeller. Prediction of cavitation and of cavity extension is another important task, since cavitation is one of the crucial aspects that influences efficiency in addition to propagated noise and blade vibration and erosion. The validation of the numerical tools that support the design process, including open-source codes, is, consequently, essential. The public availability of measurements and observations which cover not only usual thrust and torque in open water conditions (including cavitation) but also unsteady functioning with pressure pulse measurements in the case of the Potsdam Propeller Test Case certainly represents an extremely useful source of information and an excellent chance for verification and validation purposes. In the present work, the prediction of the Potsdam Propeller Test Case propeller performance using the OpenFOAM computational fluid dynamics package is proposed. After a preliminary validation and calibration of the OpenFOAM native Schnerr-Sauer interphase mass transfer model for cavitating flow, based on the experimental results on a 2D NACA66Mod hydrofoil, open water propeller performance and cavitation predictions are carried out. The OpenFOAM results are finally compared both with the available experimental measurements and with calculations carried out with StarCCM+ and with a proprietary boundary element method code, in order to assess the accuracy and the overall capabilities of the open-source tools (from meshing to post-processing) available in the OpenFOAM package. The comparison, in addition to assessing the accuracy of the open-source approach, is aimed to verify its advantages and drawbacks with respect to widely used solvers and to further verify the reliability of traditional boundary element method approaches that are still widely adopted for design and optimization (thanks to their extremely higher computational efficiency) in a very demanding test case.",

      "abstract": "The design of a propeller for a high-speed craft is addressed by using a multi-objective numerical optimization approach. By combining a fast and reliable Boundary Elements Method (BEM), a viscous flow solver based on the RANSE approximation, a parametric 3D description of the blade and a genetic algorithm, the new propeller shape is designed to improve the propulsive efficiency, reduce the cavitation extension, increase the cavitation inception speed and maximize, at the same time, the ship speed. Rather than by constraining the propeller delivered thrust, indeed, the proposed procedure works together with an engine-propeller matching algorithm that, each time a new propeller is defined, identifies the achievable maximum ship speed and the resulting engine functioning point that turn in additional goals for the multi-objective optimization. A set of optimal propellers, obtained through the design by optimization based on potential flow calculations (via the Boundary Elements Method), are selected for additional viscous analyses (RANSE calculations) in order to further validate the results of the BEM calculations and provide a deeper insight into the complex flow fields of high speed propellers. Among this subset of optimal configurations, a final geometry is selected to verify the reliability of the design procedure by means of dedicated cavitation tunnel tests and full-scale measurements on a high-speed craft provided by Azimut|Benetti.",

The propellers have been designed in the context of a research project starting from two different rake distributions (forward rake to increase thrust and efficiency, backward rake to reduce cavitation), using different techniques (traditional lifting line / lifting surface and optimization algorithm coupled with a panel code), leading thus to rather different geometries. Propellers have been tested through cavitation tunnel experiments. The activity represents an interesting case study for this kind of measurement in presence of rather large cavitation extensions. The effects of cavitation on different components of pressure pulses and noise are investigated for the different rake distributions adopted. Results clearly shows the effects of this geometrical characteristic on cavitation and pressure pulses pointing out that, in some cases, propeller hydrodynamic performances may determine pressure pulses intensity more than cavitation extensions. A simplified numerical approach, adopting stationary RANS calculations, for the evaluation of the effects of propeller geometry, has been proposed. Results show a good correlation with measurements allowing to have an insight into the phenomenon and confirming the effect of the rake.",

      "abstract": "A computational framework to design a new family of unconventional supercavitating (SC) hydrofoils with optimized hydrodynamic performance is developed. A low-order boundary element method is used to solve for the steady potential flow over the hydrofoil predicting its hydrodynamic characteristics, including the vapor-cavity interface. Shape variations are obtained by an ad hoc parametrization scheme by composite B-spline curves whose control points represent the design variables to the hydrodynamic optimization problem. The accuracy of the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) tools is also preventively validated on the experimental characteristics of a conventional SC hydrofoil. A computational test case is performed to maximize the efficiency of a SC hydrofoil accounting for both shape and angle of attack variations. The new hydrofoil leads to 40% improvement on the lift over drag ratio compared to the initial reference shape. This result is confirmed by high-fidelity unsteady multiphase viscous solver.",

      "abstract": "In this work, the design and the analysis of the performance of an improved tip loaded propeller geometry are proposed. Based on the experimental data and on the numerical results collected at SISTEMAR and at the University of Genoa in the case of Contracted and Tip Loaded (CLT) propellers, a new tip loaded propeller geometry is devised in order to mitigate some of the downsides of the CLT geometries increasingly adopted to improve full-scale propeller efficiency. The modified tip loaded propeller, i.e. a mix between a tip rake and a Contracted and Tip Loaded propeller, is designed via an optimization strategy using a Boundary Elements Method (BEM), a custom parametric description of the unconventional blade geometry and an optimization algorithm (of genetic type) within the modeFRONTIER environment. The reliability of the design process and of the improvements achievable with the modified tip loaded propeller are extensively verified with dedicated RANSE calculations. At first, the accuracy of the BEM, adopted for the design by optimization, is verified in terms of predicted propeller performance in order to assess its applicability for the analysis of modified tip geometries and check its confidence with respect to the allowable modifications of the blade shape. As a second step, viscous calculations are adopted to confirm the improvements of the newly designed geometries, in terms of both cavitation and predicted velocity field downstream the propeller, as a result of a better adaptation of the end plate geometry to the incoming flow. Finally, a set of unsteady calculations, by using the unsteady BEM, is carried out to verify the amplitude of the induced pressure pulses and, by comparing these numerical results with the available measurements and calculations in the case of a reference CLT propeller, to confirm the effectiveness of the modified propeller tip shape.",

      "abstract": "Traditionally, propeller design has been focused on all activities necessary to obtain a propeller featuring a high efficiency, avoiding erosive cavitation for given operating conditions and having adequate structural strength. In recent years, more and more challenging requirements have been imposed, such as the reduction of radiated noise and pressures pulses, requiring more precise analyses and methods in the optimization of the propeller performance. On the other hand, the evaluation of the propeller strength still relies on simplified methods, which basically consider the blade as a cantilever beam subjected to characteristic static forces. Since the loads acting on a blade are variable in the blade revolution and in different operating conditions throughout the ship life, a procedure to account for the influence of fatigue phenomena is proposed. The fatigue assessment could reduce the safety factor in the propeller scantling rules and allow improving the quality of propeller design (e.g. obtaining higher efficiency, margin on cavitation phenomena, less noise).",

The design approach is based on a parametric description of the propeller blade, derived from the usual design table by using B-Spline parametric curves, and an in-house developed Panel Method/Boundary Element Method (BEM) aimed to evaluate the performance (including cavitation) of the propellers selected by a genetic optimization algorithm. The modeFRONTIER optimization environment drives the entire design process. A preliminary sensitivity study is carried out to evaluate the effect of the discretization meshes for BEM and RANSE calculations. Based on this analysis, Boundary Element Method and RANSE results over the parent propeller, in terms of both open water propeller performance, unsteady cavitation and induced pressure pulses, are compared with the available experimental measurements in order to validate the adopted design approach. Finally, to assess the reliability of the design by optimization, a set of optimized geometries, selected on the basis of the fulfillment of the design objectives, are checked by means of dedicated RANSE calculations.",

      "abstract": "The present paper deals with the side effects of propellers cavitation, i.e. pressure pulses and radiated noise. These effects are gaining more and more importance for commercial ships for different reasons. Pressure pulses significantly affect comfort onboard, thus their reduction is of utmost importance for all ships carrying passengers. As regards the underwater radiated noise, in the last decade interest has shifted from navy applications to commercial ships, due to the concern for the rising background noise in the oceans. The propellers, generating noise directly in water, represent one of the main contributions to the overall underwater noise emitted from ships. Due to the complexity of the mechanisms of propeller noise generation, different complementary strategies have to be followed to properly analyze the problem, ranging from induced pressure pulses to broadband noise and cavitation. In the present work, part of the activities carried out in the framework of the collaborative EU FP7 project AQUO (Achieve QUieter Oceans by shipping noise footprint reduction, www.aquo.eu) are reported. The paper presents the investigations carried out on a specific test case represented by a single screw research vessel, which is analyzed with three different strategies: numerical calculations, model scale investigations and full-scale measurements.",

      "abstract": "Hydrodynamic shape optimization based on CFD calculations can dramatically improve the design of marine devices (i.e. propellers, rudders and appendages) by simultaneously considering opposite objectives and by modeling phenomena that well-established and still widely adopted design approaches (i.e. lifting line and lifting surface) cannot accurately deal with. Cavitation on propellers, for instance and among the others, is one of the most dangerous phenomena. It causes vibration, erosion and it is a source of radiated noise, consequently resulting incompatible with modern propeller design, continuously aimed for higher efficiency, comfort and environmentally safe operations. An accurate selection, firstly, of the most appropriate blade sections is, consequently, of crucial importance at least to limit the side effects of cavitation. In the present work, therefore, a numerical framework for the design by optimization of marine hydrofoils under cavitating conditions is proposed. By combining a parametric description of the hydrofoil shape, the NSGA-II multi-objective genetic algorithm and appropriate flow solvers, new hydrofoil shapes are derived. Objectives of the design are blade sections with enlarged cavitation buckets to increase the cavitation inception speed and to reduce the cavity volume (under the constraint of unchanged delivered lift) with respect to widely accepted NACA66 profiles. Boundary element methods and RANSE solvers (a proprietary Hess & Smith implementation and the open-source RANSE solver OpenFOAM) are applied in succession in order to verify the influence of the inviscid/viscous nature of the flow on the final optimal hydrofoil shape and of the additional maximum lift/drag ratio objective required in the case of viscous calculations.",

      "abstract": "A statistical analysis of noise can play an important role in evaluating the performances of an acoustic system working underwater. If the system is either placed on board a vessel or operates nearby passing ships, the noise radiated by the vessel can considerably reduce the performances of the system if it has been not designed to have enough robustness. In the paper, a statistical analysis of ship noise records measured at sea is presented. Noise data were recorded in the framework of the EU FP7 European project AQUO (Achieve QUieter Oceans by shipping noise footprint reduction). Aim of the analysis is to characterize the ship noise in terms of probability distributions and their high-order moments. Since the overall ship noise is known to be generated by a number of sources with peculiar spectral energy distributions, the vessel spectrum can change considerably with a variation in the operating conditions. This approach allows determining the dependence of ship noise statistical properties on the actual navigation condition. In addition, since the ship noise records were simultaneously recorded by a vertical array of three hydrophones, a further analysis has been carried out to determine the effect of the receiver depth, and, accordingly, of the propagation path, in the recorded signal.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, the application of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods experienced an exponential growth: The increase of the computational performances and the generalization of the Navier-Stokes equation to more complex physical problems made possible the solution of complex problems like free surfaces flows. The physical complexity of planing hulls flows poses some issues in the ability to numerically predict the global hydrodynamic parameters (hull resistance, dynamic attitude) of these configurations and on the expected confidence on the numerical results. In the last decade, commercial RANS software have been successfully applied for the prediction of the planing hull characteristics with reasonable correlation to the available experimental measurements. Recently, moreover, the interest in Open Source approaches, also for the solution of engineering problems, has rapidly grow. In this work, a set of calculations on a systematic series standard hull shape has been carried out, adopting from pre- To post- processing only Open Source tools. The comparison and the validation, through the available experimental measurements, of the computed results will define an optimal simulation strategy to include this kind of tools in the usual design loop.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents the preliminary analyses devoted to the development of a new fast-craft concept, different from typical off-shore crafts, able to reach very high speed despite its main dimensions and displacement. In particular, the analysis is focused on \"deep V hull shapes\" of overall length of about 40 m and a range of operative speeds up to 60 kn. Many issues can be found during the design phase for a new concept boat. Besides classical design problems, well studied in naval architecture, new issues and peculiarities arise for these type of very high speed craft. One of these new relevant problems is related to the evaluation of the calm water resistance curve, for which the availability of data and reliable methodologies should be deeply investigated due to the extreme conditions analyzed. The correct drag prediction is a key point, for instance, for the evaluation of the on board installed power, necessary to gain the maximum speed required and, in turn, for the evaluation of the total boat weight (being the main engine one of the most significant contributor) on the light of its strong influence on the boat trim and consequently on the drag. Similar considerations have to be carried out for the seakeeping performances, in particular for what regards the vertical motions and the evaluation of the Motion Sickness Index. In these extreme conditions, actually, very high vertical accelerations have to be expected and consequently strict operative sea states limitations have to be imposed.",

      "abstract": "The problem of the tip vortex cavitation inception is a matter of increasing interest. Main reason for this is that, despite being, generally, not erosive and not influent on the propeller mechanical characteristics, the cavitating vortex dynamics may play a significant role in the propeller radiated noise. In the present work, a thorough analysis of the capability of a commercial RANS solver in conjunction with the Schnerr-Sauer cavitation model to predict the tip and the tip leakage vortex cavitation (with particular attention to their inception) for a conventional and two ducted propellers respectively, is presented. Considering at first a conventional CP propeller, a comprehensive analysis of the effect of the various parameters (e.g. mesh characteristics, number and size of nuclei in the numerical calculations) on the computed results is reported, together with a comparison with the experimental measurements carried out in a cavitation tunnel. This analysis allows to stress the capabilities of RANS computations to correctly predict tip phenomena and to provide guidelines in order to obtain reliable numerical results, having in mind the necessity of a compromise between calculation accuracy and computational time, essential in the case of a systematic application of the presented approach for design purposes. Furthermore the calculations are repeated also for two propellers in decelerating duct and the satisfactory results obtained demonstrate the capability of the proposed approach to correctly rank two slightly different geometries also for this more complex and challenging case.",

As a consequence, a correct prediction of the ship wake, considering the differences between model and full scale, is of utmost importance. In present study, results obtained by means of traditional and well established semi-empirical methods for wake scaling and direct RANS computations are compared, considering not only the differences in the wake field, but also their effect on the propeller non-stationary behavior, which is evaluated by means of a panel code.

      "abstract": "In the present work an analysis of the reliability of different numerical approaches, namely BEM and RANSE solver, for the prediction of unsteady performances of marine propellers is presented. To this aim, the well-known Seiun-Maru Highly Skewed Propeller operating in different wakes is considered. The results of this analysis show that, in correspondence to particularly challenging conditions, i.e. when very pronounced ship wakes are present, the two approaches may provide considerably different results in terms of propeller mechanical characteristics and pressure distributions on the blades. This problem, which is implicitly eliminated when the thrust identity approach is applied (as almost always performed, as an example, for propeller analyses aimed to the evaluation of cavitation extension and/ or induced pressures), may become critical in case the codes are used for numerical self-propulsion tests, where a high accuracy in the prediction of the unsteady propeller performances in correspondence to a prescribed value of the advance coefficient, instead of the thrust coefficient, is mandatory. The analyses carried out allow to underline which are the potentially more problematic cases, in terms of wakes characteristics, and to suggest some possible reasons of the encountered discrepancies, which will need further analyses to enhance the prediction capability of numerical codes.",

New more stringent limits, together with a general requirement for performances optimization, leads to the need of a continuous review of design procedures which, in some cases, still rely on rather \"old-fashioned\" approaches. The aim of this paper is to analyse in detail the importance of considering fatigue phenomena in the propeller design, proposing a procedure for the evaluation in time of the stress field acting on a blade during one revolution, which is then considered for fatigue assessment.",

Modern design approaches, like fully numerical lifting line/lifting surface codes and optimization applied to potential panel methods satisfy this objective and allow to design conventional propellers with maximum efficiency for a given operating point. On the other hand nonconventional propellers, like CLT and Kappel like geometries, represent a further opportunity to increase efficiency and reduce the risk of cavitation. In the present work a numerical analysis of unconventional propellers will be carried out. Two different numerical approaches, a potential panel method and a RANS solver will be employed. The analysis will highlights the peculiarities of these kind of propellers, the possibility to increase efficiency and reduce cavitation risk, in order to exploit the design approaches already well proven for conventional propellers also in the case of these unconventional geometries. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group, London, UK.",

      "abstract": "Traditional engine-propeller matching techniques are mainly based on nondimensional parameters analysis: Thrust/advance coefficient or torque/advance coefficient ratio are the most used variables to assess the ship propulsion point or to match, at each selected ship speed, the selected propeller with the ship engine. The advantages of this robust and well established procedure (standard propeller open water measures only at some pitch ratios around the design configuration, availability of large databases and extrapolation laws) however, turn into the drawbacks for the inclusion of different constraints and objectives, further than the minimum fuel consumption, in the matching algorithm. On the other hand modern numerical tools and available hardware resources let to partially substitute, in the design stage, experimental campaigns and to collect large amount of information on propeller performances, including cavitation. In this sense numerical computations make out of date approaches just developed to overcome the deficiency of experimental measures. On the basis of these numerical data new algorithms for the engine-propeller matching can be developed capable of investigate different objectives and the influence of different constraints on the traditional optimum points. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group, London, UK.",

      "abstract": "In the present paper an experimental and numerical analysis of an unconventional CLT propeller is carried out. Two different numerical approaches, a potential panel method and an RANSE solver, are employed. Cavitation tunnel experiments are carried out in order to measure, as usual, thrust, torque, and cavity extension for different propeller working points. Moreover, LDV measurements are performed to have a deep insight into the complex wake behind the propeller and to analyze the dynamics of generated tip vortexes. The numerical/experimental analysis and comparison of results highlight the peculiarities of this kind of propellers, the possibility to increase efficiency and reduce cavitation risk, in order to exploit the design approaches already well proven for conventional propellers also in the case of these unconventional geometries.

The presence of the hub and of the duct with the complex interaction that take places on the gap region, in fact, makes the design process of the latter propellers a difficult task if addressed with standard lifting line approaches. Build as a Lagrange multipliers minimization problem, the proposed design code represents an efficient way to overtake all the limitations of the original Lerbs' approach. In the paper the numerical design strategy is addressed, highlighting the capabilities to treat complex configurations. Afterwards the design of single and ducted propellers, panel and RANSE methods are applied in order to validate the design procedure: OpenFOAM is employed, first, to assess the accuracy of the design approach and the results from the panel method and, secondly, to visualize the flow features on the most critical regions (at the propeller tip and at the duct trailing edge) for which reliable viscous computation are needed.",

      "abstract": "Propeller design is an activity which nowadays presents ever increasing challenges to the designer, involving not only the usual mechanical characteristics and cavitation erosion avoidance, but also other side effects, such as radiated noise and/or pressure pulses. Moreover, in some cases propeller characteristics have to be optimized in correspondence to very different functioning points, including considerably off-design conditions, which are hardly captured by conventional design methods. In present paper, a recently presented method, based on the coupling between a multiobjective optimization algorithm and a panel code, is applied to the design of a CP propeller at different pitch settings, with the aim of reducing cavitating phenomena and, consequently, resultant radiated noise. Numerical results are validated by means of an experimental campaign at cavitation tunnel, showing the capability of the method to assess propeller functioning characteristics, thus representing a very useful tool for the designer in correspondence of challenging problems.",

      "abstract": "RANS solvers are becoming a standard for the numerical prediction and for the analysis of the flow feature around the hull, including the presence of the free surface and the computation of hydrodynamic forces. Panel Methods, thank to their computational efficiency, can still, and successfully, be applied for the analysis and the design of marine propellers. Self-propulsion requires an accurate solution of both the aspects that, moreover, strongly interact. Time and spatial scales, for the propeller and for the hull, are unfortunately very different and a complete RANS solution would require non negligible computational resources. A coupled solution, in which hull is solved through RANS, propeller through panel method and the solutions matched via Body Forces and effective wake is presented as a fast and robust tool for ship self-propulsion characteristics evaluation. First a simple \"unsteady\" axial actuator disk, which momentum source strength is evaluated from the instantaneous ship hull drag, is adopted to compute wake and thrust deduction factors. Finally a more consistent model, based on an iterative approach and on unsteady body forces, is applied in order to represent the three dimensional effects related to the effective blade geometry. Results will be compared in order to identify the capabilities of the coupling technique and the hypothesis of practical applicability of such kind of procedure. © 2011: The Royal Institution of Naval Architects.",

Inside a ship wake, in inclined shaft condition, in tandem/contra rotating configurations, the spatial non uniformity of the incoming flow on the propeller plane leads to the unsteadiness responsible of thrust and torque fluctuations, induced pressures, cavitation and the associated noise. Any design method and, moreover, each analysis tool should be able to treat these phenomena, to carry out a more consistent ship oriented propeller design and to better understand the flow features and the performances of an already designed propeller.

The paper intends to give an overview on the most recent applications of the research team through results obtained in recent applications, with the opportunity to introduce the main particulars of the devised CFD methods. Each presented application corresponds to a specific request coming from yacht shipyards, designers or propulsion systems suppliers which initiated and continue to support the Marine CFD Group of the University of Genova over several research projects as a motor of innovation. Presented applications range from resistance prediction of planing hulls in dynamic equilibrium, to a hybrid inviscid-flow/RANSE solver for displacement hulls; from hull CFD based form optimization techniques, to steady and unsteady prediction of cavitating propeller hydrodynamics as well as design and optimization of special propulsion units. The background philosophy used to attack presented problems is coming from a pragmatical naval architect cut: devise new CFD methods that could balance between the results accuracy and the requested time to obtain the solution, in order to be compatible with the time frame of yacht design. © 2009 the Royal Institution of Naval Architects.",

The method is based on a B-Spline based parametric representation of the main geometric parameter of the propeller blades, such as pitch and chords distributions along the radius and blade mean surface (cambered surface) as a B-Spline surface. The automatic optimization procedure is driven by a state of the art multi-objective minimization algorithm that drives the selection of the control points that define the shape of the geometric parameters curves and surfaces. The objective function can include not only global characteristics such as efficiency and thrust, but also sheet cavitation extension and volume.
