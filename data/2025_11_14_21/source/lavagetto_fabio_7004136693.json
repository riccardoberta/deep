      "abstract": "The use of multiple access protocols information in Internet of Things (IoT) environments has gained significant interest over the past decade, particularly for crowd behavior monitoring. Due to its high data rates and low infrastructure requirements, WiFi is considered one of the most promising wireless technologies for leveraging the explosive growth of transmitted data from mobile devices. However, with the introduction of MAC address randomization and the application of new randomization policies on assigning randomized sequence numbers (SNs) to transmitted frames in mobile devices to enhance privacy, traditional approaches to device identification face significant challenges. To tackle this issue, we conduct a comprehensive analysis at the multiple access level and propose CrowdWatch which is an innovative framework designed to enhance the understanding and utilization of MAC randomization dynamics. Additionally, we introduce a novel approach that leverages multiple device-specific features to accurately associate frames with randomized MAC addresses to their corresponding devices. By integrating multimodal fingerprints, the framework can effectively identify mobile devices and track their behavior. The presented approach ensures reliable detection even under the latest randomization policies. We examined the introduced framework through real-world experiments, and the findings prove that it is an effective solution for smart building management and occupancy estimation in dynamic environments.",

As mobile devices become increasingly sophisticated, their capacity for wireless communication presents both opportunities for enhanced connectivity and privacy-related challenges. This study examines critical features of probe request frames and their role in device fingerprinting. We highlight the challenges and advancements in communicating between mobile devices and nearby networks by analyzing the randomization policies employed by various operating systems and their effectiveness in masking device identities. Through comprehensive experiments conducted across multiple mobile devices and operating system versions, we capture and analyze probe request frames under different user-device interaction phases. Our findings indicate variations in transmission frequency and the impact of connection states on broadcasting characteristics. We also investigate the deployed randomization policies in different brands of mobile devices, uncovering their influence on privacy preservation. This research provides notable insights for developing more effective wireless communication approaches, contributing to the broader goal of enhancing user privacy in this field.",

      "abstract": "Enabled by the integration of AI and the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), smart and remote monitoring systems are poised to play a pivotal role in the future of healthcare. Specifically, monitoring respiration is a critical component of this evolution, offering a straightforward yet effective method for assessing an individual's health status. In this paper, we introduce an innovative contactless approach to respiration monitoring that leverages Channel State Information (CSI) from Wi-Fi channels. By analyzing variations in the amplitude and phase of CSI data, we infer human respiration patterns. To validate our method, we conducted experiments with multiple subjects in indoor environments, assessing the system's capability to track the respiration cycle and determine breathing frequency. We also compared the performance of various AI algorithms in identifying accurate breath rates. Our findings indicate that the CSI-based system is a promising solution for respiration monitoring, achieving an average accuracy of approximately 84% in estimating breathing frequency, thus paving the way for future studies to enhance the robustness of the proposed approach.",

      "abstract": "The convergence of Symbiotic Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI) foundational models, and 6G is ushering in a new era of intelligent connectivity, where networks, devices, and algorithms operate in close coordination to enable real-time, adaptive, and efficient systems. In the context of structural health monitoring (SHM), this integrated vision provides a powerful framework to tackle challenges, such as limited resources, harsh environments, and the need for timely, high-fidelity data. By enabling intelligent, collaborative processing across edge and network layers, it supports efficient data compression, transmission, and decision-making—ensuring robust and adaptive monitoring even in complex structural settings. In this work, we investigate the use of AI for data compression in an IoT-based SHM scenario. Specifically, we evaluate and compare the performance of four different convolutional autoencoder (convolutional AEs (CAEs)) in compressing and reconstructing inertial signals collected from various structural systems, aiming to enable adaptive and context-aware processing directly at the edge. By testing across heterogeneous sources, we assess the generalizability and robustness of each CAE model, providing insights into the potential of deep learning-based compression techniques for SHM applications.",

      "abstract": "Mobile devices with enabled Wi-Fi continuously discover nearby access points by broadcasting management frames known as probe requests. This broadcasting leaks fingerprints that can be used to identify the presence and movement of flow in a given area. To protect users' privacy and location, probe requests use randomized MAC addresses generated according to the randomization protocols. In this paper, we analyze the behavior and characteristics of probe request frames across different devices from various vendors, operating systems, and features, as well as the influence of user-device interaction in different phases. In particular, we provide a detailed examination of the adoption of MAC address randomization techniques to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of recent randomization policies and to demonstrate that, despite the OS implementation, there is still potential to utilize open Wi-Fi in different services and development.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, the increase in the elderly population has placed significant burdens on post-rehabilitation schemes, resulting in high logistical costs and considerable social impacts due to hospitalization or frequent visits. These challenges call for a transformation in the traditional approach to physical patient care, which can be achieved by leveraging the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), particularly through the use of pervasive wearable sensors. When attached to patients during treatment or therapy, these sensors can provide valuable supplementary information to healthcare professionals. When it comes to adopting IoMT technologies, cost efficiency, portability, and generalization are key factors. Specifically, this study aims to enhance the cost-effectiveness and versatility of wearable eHealth monitoring architectures that utilize foot pressure-sensing hardware for the motor assessment of post-stroke and neurologically impaired patients. It leverages lower limb inertial measurement unit sensory information and machine learning to mitigate the reliance on foot pressure-sensing hardware. We demonstrate the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in predicting fine-scale foot pressure using only inexpensive, off-the-shelf motion sensors. We propose a self-supervised, exercise-agnostic asynchronous foot pressure decoding model that does not require human annotation. The algorithm is thoroughly evaluated using appropriate performance metrics, and our experimental tests show promising results.",

      "abstract": "Structural health monitoring (SHM) is a process aimed at studying variations in the expected behavior of a structure in order to locate damage, material deterioration and other abnormalities. To this aim, SHM is usually performed continuously, thus generating large amounts of data, often by employing wired, expensive and proprietary systems. Introducing low-cost, low-energy consumption and low-rate IoT devices allows for cheaper and easier installations also in scenarios where computation and transmission resources are limited. Since many structural signals (e.g., vibrations) are sparse in the frequency domain, it is possible to apply well-known compressive sensing (CS) techniques to limit the amount of information to be transmitted. CS allows recovering a vector using a reduced amount of entries, thus being able to perform sub-Nyquist sampling. This article shows the results obtained by applying CS to inertial signals coming from wireless IoT devices, developed as laboratory prototypes, applied to real structures (specifically, a bridge). Such findings are further expanded by discussing the efficiency of CS with respect to the number of used samples and its feasibility for IoT applications, from the transmission burden and energy consumption standpoints.",

      "abstract": "Despite recent advancements, Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) remains a difficult task, particularly when dealing with drone videos. A variety of challenges, such as data association, varying levels of occlusion, camera motion, and missing detection, affect the effectiveness of MOT tasks. Data association in tracking-by-detection approaches plays a critical role in determining how detections from previous frames are linked to generate coherent tracks. To address this challenge, merging spatial and visual cues may not lead to identical matching pairs for the given detections and tracks. Thus, the performance of the MOT task can be improved by pairing them individually and then determining the best matching pair. It is therefore proposed a Multi-Class MOT (MCMOT) tracker with a cascaded data association strategy in which, during the first stage, matching pairs based on appearance and spatial information are identified separately. The best matching pair is then identified out of these pairs in the second stage and updated as an active track. In addition, the Kalman Filter (KF) estimation and Constant Velocity Assumption (CVA) model are employed to effectively address scenarios involving missed detections and occlusion handling by utilizing motion data. Experiments were carried out on the two state-of-the-art datasets, VisDrone-MOT and UA-DETRAC, to validate the effectiveness of the proposed MCMOT tracker, which demonstrated the improved performance when compared against six different state-of-the-art trackers by providing as input different detectors.",

      "abstract": "Human balance is essential for everyday activities, from basic functions like standing and walking to more complex movements required in sports and work tasks. Optimal balance reduces the risk of falls, a major cause of injuries among the elderly and individuals with certain medical conditions. However, traditional force platforms can be prohibitively expensive for smaller clinics and individual practitioners, and patients with mobility issues may find it difficult to access locations equipped with such platforms. In light of these challenges, this work explores the effectiveness and versatility of using simpler hardware for pressure sensing. As an alternative to conventional force platforms, low-cost wearable sensors, such as Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs), have been explored. This research focuses on developing a simple yet effective balance evaluation system using smart-glasses embedded with an IMU sensor to replace traditional feet pressure sensing machines. Furthermore, we developed a custom dataset for the estimation of sway parameters by simultaneously collecting the IMU data and labels from the force platform for a set of 20 participants. We experimented with various Deep Learning (DL) models, leveraging the latest advancements in Machine Learning (ML), to estimate sway parameters such as sway path, sway area, and their ratio, typically measured by the gold standard force platform. When evaluated with appropriate performance criteria, the experimental results indicate that our proposed methodology performs robustly using only accelerometer data.",

      "abstract": "Brain stroke is a pathology affecting a significant number of people worldwide. A fast diagnosis is required to administer the correct therapy and frequent monitoring is usually necessary during follow-up. Microwave imaging represents a promising technology able to address such needs and that may complement gold-standard systems. In this framework, a novel Lebesgue-space approach for microwave imaging of stroke is presented in this paper. The developed method combines an inexact-Newton inversion technique in variable-exponent Lebesgue spaces with a data-driven regularization term. In this way, a-priori information about the configuration under test, e.g., the head structure, can be exploited and the convergence of the method can be enhanced. The method is preliminarily evaluated by means of numerical simulations involving realistic head phantoms. The obtained results confirm that the developed approach allows identifying and characterizing the stroke with a good accuracy.",

      "abstract": "The class imbalance and long-tail characteristics of real-world aerial datasets make object detection methods difficult to improve their performance. Disparities in class distribution, particularly between long-tail and head classes (foreground-foreground disparity), impede the efficacy of less prevalent categories. Thus, the goal of this work is to improve the performance of tail categories in long-tail aerial datasets while enhancing or at-least maintaining the performance of head categories. To achieve this, a weighting and re-weighting strategy is proposed that focuses on the foreground-foreground disparity in classes at the dataset level, thereby enhancing the accuracy of less prevalent categories. The proposed strategy is evaluated using two long-tail aerial datasets, the drone-based VisDrone DETection (VisDroneDET) and the Satellite Imagery Multivehicles Dataset (SIMD), and one-stage object detection models. Compared to baseline models, most tail categories show significant performance improvements, highlighting the importance of the weighting strategy to address class imbalances in long-tail object detection.",

      "abstract": "Object recognition is a quite critical task that involves the identification and potential localization of a target inside a monitored area. Target detection usually relies on material, shape and size identification in order to infer higher level information, and it can be employed in many different frameworks and applications. In this connection, we carry out a performance evaluation campaign on WiFi Channel State Information (CSI)-based object recognition techniques used to automatically identify material, category and specific objects among daily life items. The main contribution of this work is to provide a thorough comparison of the performance of different machine learning algorithms on recognition using a real-life experimental testbed. The performance study shows that the Random Forest (RF) classifier proves very accurate in terms of correct target recognition, independently of the considered task. The employed deep learning algorithm, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), is similarly able to attain very good results. In particular, accuracy values reach 94.8% in material identification, 97.1% in category differentiation and 98.1% in object recognition tasks.",

      "abstract": "Contactless patient monitoring is one of the most trending topics in eHealth, due to the utmost importance of non-invasive tele-enabled biomedical systems in next-generation healthcare. In this connection, this work investigates Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using commodity 5GHz WiFi devices, exploiting Channel State Information (CSI) to distinguish among a set of actions performed by different people. The position and movements of the human body affect wireless signal reflections and, consequently, CSI. Data collected from wireless packets are organized into the CSI matrix, which describes the status of the link at each time instant. In this work we employ amplitude and phase information, related to the variations in CSI values, to classify human activities leveraging simple machine learning techniques. Different radio link modes are also compared to evaluate their impact on the classification performance. Experimental results show that CSI data is capable of providing very accurate results in classifying activities performed by different people, especially when considering phase-related information in a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) configuration, thus making CSI-based HAR a promising solution for contactless patient monitoring.",

      "abstract": "Alongside many traditional as well as novel applications, in the latest years, drones have been widely adopted as remote sensing platforms for road traffic monitoring in urban areas and on highways. The problem of traffic monitoring on Region of Interest (RoI) based on drone imagery is a challenging task, especially when the surveillance drone is constantly moving. In this work, two specific subtasks have been addressed. The goal of the first stage is to predict the RoI in drone imagery of traffic scenes using deep-learning (DL)-based approaches instead of traditional image processing; in this connection, the goal of the second task is to perform vehicle detection on the selected RoI. To ensure diversity and robustness, drone images with different altitudes, positions, and view points have been considered. To achieve these goals, two custom aerial data sets for RoI extraction and detection were built by collecting aerial sequences from flying unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and by transmitting them to the base station leveraging 5G technology. Two different ad hoc DL-based architectures have been designed for the RoI extraction task to maximize the accuracy and inference speed, respectively, and have been evaluated on two different data sets: 1) a custom-built data set and 2) a Massachusetts roads data set. Finally, the models providing the best performance have been combined to further improve the overall results. Experimental tests show that the proposed framework represents a promising solution for drone-based road traffic monitoring in critical areas, exploiting imagery from a variety of viewing angles and altitudes.",

      "abstract": "The eHealth systems are in great demand, particularly during times of outbreak like COVID-19, when there is a shortage of caregivers. The technological advancements, such as wearable wireless devices, the Internet of Things, and improved machine learning methods have made these systems more reliable. In modern times, these systems can play a vital role in post-rehabilitation journeys, which have significant social impact and high costs in traditional settings. Cost efficiency, portability, and generalization are key factors in adopting new technology. In this study, we investigate the potential for optimizing and simplifying hardware in order to increase the cost-effectiveness and versatility of post-stroke eHealth rehabilitation systems. It leverages the rich information available from Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors to compensate the need for foot pressure sensing. We present the first attempt to demonstrate the potential of machine learning, aided by affordable off the shelf motion sensing devices, for foot pressure analysis. Our proposed foot pressure decoding model is trained in an exercise-agnostic, self-supervised manner that eliminates the need for human annotation. The algorithm is evaluated using appropriate performance metrics, and our experimental results show very promising performance.",

      "abstract": "Compressive Sensing (CS) is a sampling technique which, provided the sparsity of the arrival domain and specific properties of the reconstruction matrix, allows rebuilding a vector starting from a significantly small subset of measures. This paves the way to a plethora of applications, ranging from specialized frameworks, such as medical imaging, to more general purposes, such as data compression. Among these, Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is a primary and current topic, focused on analyzing structures to determine their residual lifespan and their health conditions (material degradation, damage localization, disaster prevention, etc.), In this regard, CS is able to provide accurate results, at the same time limiting the amount of data needed to propagate information between different end-points. Indeed, SHM usually deals with continuous flows of information originating from heterogeneous sensors and locations, often characterized by diverse computational power and signal coverage. In this paper we apply CS to signals coming from two different structures, i.e., a laboratory model and a bridge. Results show that CS is a viable way of reconstructing the considered signals by exploiting a subset of samples while still maintaining a high degree of precision, achieving an average normalized RMSE of 0.12.",

After the development of voxel-based models of stroke-affected child heads, the forward electromagnetic problem has been solved by means of a finite-difference time-domain solver in a three-dimensional configuration. Preliminary numerical reconstructions of the dielectric properties of head tissues have also been carried out by means of a nonlinear inverse-scattering procedure.",

Under certain conditions, a signal can be sampled at rates lower than the Nyquist rate, introducing a different kind of approach to signal handling, both in the acquisition and in the reconstruction phases. CS relies on the property of sparsity, the idea that a signal possesses an amount of information which is smaller than the amount of data required to store it. This paper employs the CS approach to inertial signals sensed by innovative IoT devices by showing applications of real-world infrastructure monitoring. Numerical results show that our approach is able to efficiently estimate the infrastructures modal frequencies with an innovative inertial IoT prototype by achieving a compression level around 20 times below the Nyquist rate.",

      "abstract": "According to data traffic forecast reported in Cisco (2018), the volume of data transported by Internet in 2021 will exceed the threshold of 3.0 ZB per year, generated by roughly 30 billions of devices. SATCOM's capability to bring Internet connectivity in parts of the world that until few years ago was impossible to reach (e.g., in the middle of the ocean), the use of satellite platforms for M2M services has become more and more widespread, with an unprecedented increase over the last five years (see Herrero and De Gaudenzi, 2012 and Scalise et al., 2013) and expected further diffusion in the near future. One of the most interesting applications, enabled by the Internet of Things (IoT), that has attracted significant attention in the M2M field is the personal vocal assistant (PVA). It is a software agent that can perform tasks or services for an individual based on commands or questions given through voice instructions. The main contribution of this article is a performance analysis, both theoretical and simulated, of satellite networks for PVA services over cruise ships. Namely, a PVA must provide feedback to the user in a short amount of time to guarantee a high Quality of Experience (QoE) Zhang et al., 2013. For this analysis, we tested different satellite providers and we come to a conclusion regarding their feasibility as a reference network for the PVS employment on a cruise ship. Future studies will investigate the proposed scenario by broadening the performance analysis through actual measurements over a real-world satellite channel to practically demonstrate the validity of our approach.",

      "abstract": "From smart cities development perspective, road vehicle detection exploiting drone-based aerial imagery is a crucial part of traffic surveillance and monitoring systems where effective results are of utmost demand. A recent boom in the field of deep learning (DL) has provided remarkable development in the problem of vehicle detection. Aerial views pose more complexity with respect to the ground view but the rapid advancement in the field of DL, the volume of data, and hardware configuration has facilitated the realization of these intelligent detection systems effectively. In this article, a detailed performance evaluation of some of the main state-of-the-art DL-based object detection techniques has been carried out along with an experimental analysis of vehicle detection using the RetinaNet framework on the VisDrone-benchmark data set. The performance of the RetinaNet framework has been validated together with the results provided by the VisDrone team. Further experiments are then conducted to investigate the impact of various parameters. Finally, the selection of suitable models that can be practically implemented is also discussed based both on a qualitative and quantitative analysis.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly utilized in smart cities to perform traffic monitoring tasks such as multiple object detection and tracking. The task's criticality is dependent on the drones' dynamic altitude, movable camera, and various viewing angles. These challenges are addressed once the UAVs' collected data is received. However, parameters affecting drone data collecting flight operations must also be explored, including drone actual flight time, data collection time, and energy consumption profile. The drone flight time would depend upon the battery capacity and energy consumption profile, which comprises drone movement, data collection, and communication energies. Besides, data collection energy consumption is subjected to video quality, frame rates, and data compression. The installed battery in UAVs is of limited capacity and determining actual flight time, data collection time, and energy consumption profile based on the factors mentioned above is critical. This paper develops and examines a drone energy consumption profile and proposes a drone flight strategy in a surveillance scenario to correctly estimate the drone's actual flight time, data collection time, and the distance the drone could travel from its original location. The results of this analysis are presented as a test case for flying a drone to collect the traffic monitoring data.",

      "abstract": "Drones and video processing have become a vital and integrated aspect of smart city development in several applications such as search and rescue, surveillance and delivery. Newly, camera-equipped drones are flown, and high-resolution photos and video data are relayed via a communication link to the base station. Apart from tackling the video processing issues in applications, such as object identification and tracking, energy consumption that may present a stumbling block in completing a successful drone flight for data collecting must be highlighted and considered. Drones have a limited amount of energy storage, which must be used to power the drone's movement, hovering, data collection, and communication. This study aims at building and testing a drone energy profile that estimates the total energy consumed and a maximum flying time of a drone in a traffic monitoring scenario. Additionally, the relationship between the video processing task and the drone energy profile is explored to determine the optimal strategy for flying the drones while maintaining the video processing task's performance. The conclusion of this evaluation and investigation can be conceived of as the test-case scenario to fly a drone for surveillance and monitoring applications to attain the optimum results.",

      "abstract": "Drone deployment has become crucial in a variety of applications, including solutions to traffic issues in metropolitan areas and highways. On the other hand, data collected via drones suffers from several problems, including a wide range of object scales, angle variations, truncation, and occlusion. To process and manipulate visual data from the drones, a variety of image processing algorithms have been employed, each with a distinct aim. Additionally, recent breakthroughs in the field of Artificial Intelligence, particularly deep learning, have attracted broad interest and are being applied to many domains in the framework of smart cities, including road traffic monitoring. The purpose of this study is to conduct a systematic review of drone-based traffic monitoring systems from a deep learning perspective. This work focuses on vehicle detection, tracking, and counting, since they are fundamental building blocks towards founding solutions for traffic congestion, flow rate and vehicle speed estimation. Additionally, drone-based datasets are examined, which face issues and problems caused by the diversity of features inherent of drone devices. The review analysis presented in this work summarizes the literature solutions provided and deployed so far and discusses future research trends in establishing a comprehensive traffic monitoring system in support of the development of smart cities.",

In the context of smart cities and intelligent transportation systems, Structure Health Monitoring (SHM) has gained increasing attention lately, due to the critical conditions of specific civil infrastructures, which led to unfortunate accidents. In this connection, we propose a low-cost, versatile and self-sustaining platform based on the Narrow Band-IoT (NB-IoT) technology aimed at efficiently and continuously monitoring the conditions of critical civil structures. We also provide both lab and in-site experimental tests comparing the performance obtained with our prototype with respect to professional monitoring equipment.

      "abstract": "Remotely piloted vehicles have become more and more popular in recent years due to their increased availability on the market. In general, drones can represent a threat for public safety due to their potential misuse. This motivation gives rise to the need of devising specific methods and techniques to monitor sensitive areas, in order to deploy effective drone surveillance systems. These systems are designed to detect nearby undesired targets, and to neutralize impending threats. One of the main tasks involved in this scenarios is target localization, which can be performed with different approaches. In particular, in this article we carry out a study on the main literature works related to the framework of wireless target localization based on RF and WiFi techniques, providing a thorough analysis on the perspective of their deployment in drone surveillance applications.",

      "abstract": "Brain stroke treatments are strongly time-dependent. Indeed, the literature stresses the need for quick diagnosis to guarantee the most effective therapy with the famous motto 'time is brain' [1]. Numerically speaking, a crucial goal for strokes is trying to achieve a door-to-needle time shorter than 60 minutes, called The Golden Hour [2], within which patients have the highest probability of a full recovery. This article presents a prototype of a Smart Helmet, a wearable device originally introduced in [3], [4], thought to be employed on site, to efficiently recognize and detect a brain stroke in a patient when the first aid medical team arrives. This work presents two different but complementary approaches: signal-processing-based and electromagnetic (EM). The former aims at outputting a two-level diagnosis: the presence (or not) of a stroke and (if it is present) of which type (ischemic or hemorrhagic), while the latter provides an accurate imaging of the brain that must be interpreted by medical staff. Both approaches are analyzed and compared, showing their strengths and highlighting their weaknesses.",

One of the major opportunities offered by IoT lies in the ubiquitous connectivity, thus enabling smart services such as remote patient monitoring, in-home therapy/rehabilitation, and assisted living platforms. In this paper we present a prototype of wearable smart glasses able to monitor the Eye Blinks (EBs) through ElectroOculoGram (EOG) signal in a transparent way with respect to the final user. We propose a novel pre-filtering scheme to reduce EOG noise along with an analytical derivation of a matched filter to detect and count EBs. We have carried out an in-depth experimental campaign in order to validate the robustness of our approach with respect to the main solutions available in the literature. Furthermore, we have compared the performances obtained with out wearable prototype versus the results achievable with professional medical equipments. Results show that our solution is able to achieve very high accuracy in EB detection, obtaining comparable performance with respect to professional medical desktop equipment, with the additional benefit of portability, comfort and easiness of use for the patients.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, have become dominant recently in all fields including military, commercial, and other multiapplications, such as agriculture, search and rescue, infrastructures monitoring, and surveillance, especially for safety and security purposes. On one hand, deployment of UAVs has facilitated end-users and, on the other hand, this enormous increase in the usage of UAVs has raised many concerns with regard to security, harm, threats, and privacy issues by different agencies, governments, private organizations even by people in their residencies, which has stimulated and motivated many researchers toward the designing of anti-drone systems in order to be secure from such risks. The main objective of this chapter is to provide a comprehensive survey concerning the work carried out in the designing of an anti-drone system for detection, localization, and tracking using Radio Frequency (RF-) and WiFi-based techniques. In the category of drone detection, drone identification, and classification are also being explored. In more detail, this chapter will highlight the key factors of the surveyed techniques and the characteristics of such systems to deploy them, practically. Indeed, current studies provide systematic ways to understand the procedures, methods, tools, and techniques, as well as experimental setups, which have been carried out for the implementation of drone-surveillance systems. A comparison of the performance, found in the literature, of the designed systems in this field is presented and analyzed. Finally, open challenges, possible future research trends, and direction are highlighted in the context of drone detection, localization, and tracking systems. The presented survey chapter is aimed at providing a guide for the research community as it could be an ignition to work further with specific direction so making these crucial systems versatile and ready to be deployed practically to meet their potential market demand.",

      "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) framework is moving the research community to provide smart systems and solutions aimed at revolutionizing medical sciences and healthcare. Given the extreme diffusion of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), the demand for a solution to early detect neurological symptoms of such diseases strongly arose. According to the medical literature, such early detection can be obtained through the correlation between PD and AD and some external symptoms: the Essential Tremor (ET) and the number of Eye Blinks (EBs). In this paper, which can be considered as an extended version of [1], we present a prototype of wearable smart glasses able to detect the presence of ET of the head and to count the number of EBs at the same time, in a transparent way with respect to the final user. Numerical results demonstrate the reliability of the proposed approach: the proposed algorithms are able to i) correctly recognize the ET with an overall accuracy above 97% and ii) count the number of EBs with an overall error around 9%.",

However, the mobile framework suffers from typical constraints on energy and computational capabilities due to the inherent characteristics of wireless mobile devices. For this reason, in order to be suitable for deploying in such framework, a place recognition algorithm should be thrifty in terms of resource consumption. In this paper we consider six different WiFi-based outdoor positioning approaches and we analytically derive an upper-bound for their computational burden in terms of number of FLoating-point OPerations (FLOPs).",

      "abstract": "This article describes a microwave tomographic approach for the quantitative imaging of brain stroke inside the human head. For the acquisition of the scattered-field information, a prototype of multistatic system is adopted. An array of custom antennas is placed in contact with the head, and a switching matrix is used to measure the scattering parameters for each pair of probes. The collected data are processed by an inversion method based on a variable-exponent Lebesgue-space regularization technique, whose outcome is a map of dielectric properties of a slice of the head. With respect to previous approaches, this kind of inversion procedure performs an adaptive update of the Lebesgue-space exponents on the basis of the results at each inexact-Newton iteration and exploits stepped frequency data. This allows for an automatic setting of the regularization level, which becomes variable and target-dependent inside the whole investigation domain. The proposed approach is validated by means of FDTD synthetic simulations with a realistic 3-D forward scattering model of the human head, as well as by using real experimental cylindrical test phantoms filled with saline and glycerin/water mixtures.",

The healthcare system is among the main scenarios that are benefiting from this new trend, thus giving rise to the concept of eHealth. In this framework we propose SmartPANTS, an IoT-based wireless system specifically designed for the rehabilitation of lower limbs. Our system is conceived as a prototype of a medical platform to be employed during the physical therapy for patients recovering from a brain stroke condition. SmartPANTS includes a signal processing and machine learning algorithm able to automatically recognize the type of exercise the patient is performing, and to provide real-time feedback on the execution. Moreover, experimental tests show that our platform is able to estimate the execution time of the different exercises, providing values very close to real ones. Performance results show that the SmartPANTS system is able to correctly identify the type of exercise currently being performed with an accuracy of about 99%.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, the emerging framework of the Internet of Things has been leading the technological landscape in a number of different fields and applications, from autonomous and connected vehicles to wearable devices. The healthcare system is benefiting from this continuously evolving environment since it leverages the opportunities offered by the ubiquitous and pervasive presence of connected objects and smart services. This attitude has given rise to the concept of eHealth, thus enabling new approaches and solutions for healthcare. In this framework we propose SmartPants, an IoT-based wireless system specifically designed for the remote rehabilitation of lower limbs in poststroke patients. The platform consists of multiple nodes used to monitor physical therapy and a software platform that provides real-time feedback on the execution by recognizing the type of exercise currently being performed by the patient. Our experimental results, evaluated through appropriate metrics, show that the proposed movement recognition algorithm provides very good results in terms of classification performance, independent of the considered classifier, with an average true positive rate of about 91 percent and an overall accuracy of around 96.5 percent.",

In such smart environments, user localization plays a central role. More specifically, Point-of-Interest (POI) recognition is one of the most attractive Location-Based-Service (LBS) applications. This paper provides computational complexity upper bounds for fingerprint-based POI recognition algorithms. We have considered five algorithms reported in a former work: LRACI and its extended variant ELRACI, BeaconPrint, PlaceSense, SensLoc and SAPFI. For each of them a close-form of their computational complexity has been derived, both for the training and the recognition phase. The results obtained in this works allow a comprehensive and fair comparison of some of the most well-known POI recognition algorithms.",

Though plenty of solutions exist for recognizing indoor places, almost no idea is present in the literature for recognizing big outdoor places without the GPS employment. Though these solutions assure great accuracy they also have a strong request in terms of energy necessary to achieve such result. This paper proposes a Place of Interest (POI) recognition algorithm called Enhanced-LRACI.

E-LRACI aims at recognizing big outdoor places only by using WiFi Access Points (APs) over mobile devices (smartphones). The main contributions of this work are: i) it solves the problem of big outdoor POI recognition without using GPS by leveraging on the concept of spot, ii) it proposes a novel fingerprint (FP) algorithm and iii) it outperforms the results obtained by other reference works in terms of recognition accuracy. Performance investigation reported in this paper, carried out on real data acquired over mobile devices (Android smartphones), shows that our proposal is able to correctly recognize big outdoor POIs in 95% of the cases whereas other state of the art papers do not exceed 89%.",

      "abstract": "The growing interest in concepts such as smart cities and smart mobility is giving more and more importance to place of interest (POI) information, which proves to be crucial in providing efficient and tailored location-based services (LBSs). Though plenty of solutions exist for recognizing indoor places, the literature lacks of approaches aimed at recognizing big outdoor places without the GPS employment. Even if GPS-based solutions assure great accuracy, they have a strong request in terms of energy necessary to achieve such result. As a consequence, if LBSs are thought on the move (e.g., mobile devices such as smartphones are used) energy consumption is a key constraint. This paper proposes a POI recognition algorithm called enhanced location recognition algorithm for automatic check-in applications (E-LRACI). It is an evolution of LRACI (Location Recognition Algorithm for automatic Check-In applications, originally reported in [I. Bisio, F. Lavagetto, M. Marchese, and A. Sciarrone, ''GPS/HPS-andwifi fingerprint-based location recognition for check-in applications over smartphones in cloud-based LBSS,'' IEEE Transactions on Multimedia, vol. 15, no. 4, pp. 858-869, Jun. 2013]) which aims at recognizing big outdoor places by only exploiting radio beacons emitted by WiFi access points. In terms of contributions, this paper first, proposes a novel fingerprint algorithm; second, solves the problem of big outdoor POI recognition without using GPS by leveraging the concept of spot; and third, compares the results obtained by E-LRACI and other reference works both in terms of recognition accuracy and computational complexity. The obtained numerical results, carried out on real data (acquired with Android-based smartphones), prove that E-LRACI provides the best results since it is able to guarantee the highest accuracy (95% versus, at most, 89%) at a lowest computational complexity with respect to the existing POI recognition algorithms.",

The great diffusion of remotely piloted devices unfortunately leads to several security and safety concerns that need to be tackled. In this paper, we consider a fingerprint-based drone detection approach relying on the analysis of WiFi traffic features to identify the presence of unauthorized devices. In particular, we study the statistical distribution of the features composing the fingerprint vector, and we propose an adversarial approach to drone detection in order to invalidate the reliability of the surveillance system, by introducing fake ad-hoc traffic features. Results show that our novel approach is able to deceive the drone detection system through the introduction of flows belonging to arbitrary traffic classes. Also, the proposed adversarial method provides the expected significant impact on the performance of the system, actually reducing the recognition accuracy to about 50%.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, Internet of Things (IoT) devices can collect a large amount of data and infer the context they are operating in. One of the most pervasive IoT device is the smartphone. Among the plethora of sensors that such device has, microphone is probably the most versatile. It can be used to infer information about the context by acquiring the environmental sound. In this paper, we propose an active ultrasonic-based method able to sense context information. The approach is based on the emission of periodic ultrasonic impulses, called pings, whose echoes are continuously acquired to extract a proper set of features. Using a classifier the context information is then retrieved. Two applications are presented: 1) an indoor/outdoor detector and 2) an earphone wearing state detector. In both cases a smartphone is the employed device. The former senses if the smartphone is in an indoor or outdoor environment while the latter detects if a user is wearing or not his earphones. The obtained results are encouraging for both the solutions that have been stressed in different working conditions and employed within proper application frameworks.",

      "abstract": "IPID5180477. Several research teams around the world are currently involved in developing imaging systems, with different specific final objectives and considered modalities. Although excellent results have been reported in the scientific literature (see, for example, [1], [2], and the references therein), there are theoretical and practical difficulties that still make these techniques a challenge. The former are related to the processing of data (limited amount of information, low signal-to-noise ratios, ill-posedness, etc.), whereas the latter are essentially related to the effective realization and use of the system. In this paper, we discuss some recent results related to a tomographic system which is currently under development. In particular, a new reconstruction procedure based on a conjugate gradient approach, directly implemented in the framework of the L p Banach spaces, is presented. This inversion procedure, preliminary discussed in [3], seems to be particularly suitable for obtaining a regularized solution of the inverse scattering problem, with less artefacts and noise (on the final image) due to a reduction of the usually encountered over-smoothing effects. The effectiveness of the approach is evaluated, even with three-dimensional data, by means of numerical simulations involving an accurate model of the human head.",

      "abstract": "The importance of robust audio speech processing has rapidly increased in the latest years, as the number of smart and connected devices is growing. This effect is strongly related to the Internet of things framework, introducing concepts such as connected vehicles and future smart cities. Context-Aware applications are fundamental in this evolving environment, enabling smart and custom-Tailored services for a variety of users. The use of on-board speaker recognition (SR) systems can play a key role in enhancing the customization of in-vehicle applications, by identifying the actual users and personalizing services based on their identity. Driven by this motivation, in this paper we present a performance study of an SR system, designed to face typical challenging conditions of an in-vehicle environment. We propose the design of a robust speaker identification algorithm embedding a smart preprocessing method based on voice activity detection, which can effectively reduce the influence of noise and distance on classification. Results show that our solution is able to efficiently improve the correct classification rate, even in the case of distant audio acquisition and in a variety of noisy environments.",

      "abstract": "Indoor positioning systems have gained a lot of attention in the last few years. With the introduction of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, the knowledge of user's location has become crucial information to deliver the efficient and tailored Location Based Services (LBS), especially in indoor environments. In this paper we propose an AP (Access Point)-centred indoor positioning system that overcomes common limitations presented in conventional positioning systems, such as an excessive involvement of Mobile Devices (MDs). Our work merges ideas originally proposed in [1] and [2] to build an efficient, accurate and smart Probabilistic-FingerPrint (P-FP) algorithm that avoids the MD involvement and considers the signal strength measurements as a random variable in the positioning process. Numerical results, obtained in a real-world deployment, show better performance on positioning accuracy, energy consumption and latency with respect to the MD-based architecture.",

      "abstract": "This article surveys the concept of Industry 4.0 (I4.0), which has become more and more pervasive in recent years thanks to the great effort that factories, researchers, and organizations are putting into its definition and development. We present the IoT as the key I4.0 technology since it enables faster and more efficient production and management processes, leveraging the flexibility of smart, ubiquitous, connected devices. In particular, we discuss the role of the I4.0 revolution in driving the diffusion of smart products and services, by focusing on ambient intelligence and context awareness in IoT and on the so-called DIKW hierarchy. Finally, to demonstrate the practical impact of this emerging framework, we show, as practical examples, three typical I4.0 applications in the smart factory, smart home, and smart health scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Amateur drones are enjoying great popularity in recent years due to the wide commercial diffusion of small, rather low-cost devices. More and more user-friendly, easy-to-pilot aerial and terrestrial drones are available off the shelf, and people can even remotely pilot them using their smartphones. This situation brings up the problem of keeping unauthorized drones away from private or sensitive areas, where they can represent a personal or public threat. With this motivation, after a survey of the existing solutions, we propose a WiFi-based approach aimed at detecting nearby aerial or terrestrial devices by performing statistical fingerprint analysis on wireless traffic. This novel detection technique, tested in a variety of real-life scenarios, proved able to efficiently detect and identify intruder drones in all the considered experimental setups, making it a promising unmanned aerial vehicle detection approach in the framework of amateur drone surveillance.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, a numerical study devoted to evaluate the application of a microwave imaging method for brain stroke detection is described. First of all, suitable operating conditions for the imaging system are defined by solving the forward electromagnetic scattering problem with respect to simplified configurations and analyzing the interactions between an illuminating electromagnetic wave at microwave frequencies and the biological tissues inside the head. Then, preliminary inversion results are obtained by applying an imaging procedure based on an iterative Gauss-Newton scheme to a realistic model of the human head. The proposed imaging algorithm is able to deal with the nonlinear and ill-posed problem associated to the integral equations describing the inverse scattering problem. The aim of the inversion procedure is related to the determination of the presence of a hemorrhagic brain stroke by retrieving the distributions of the dielectric parameters of the human tissues inside a slice of the head model.",

At the same time, the need for surveillance methods able to detect the presence of unauthorized drones meets the ubiquitous connectivity and pervasive technology typical of the big data era. This dualism drives the research community towards the design of monitoring systems able to integrate machine learning methods and data mining techniques in this evolving environment. In this framework, we consider a WiFi based approach aimed at detecting nearby unmanned aerial vehicles, by performing statistical fingerprint analysis on wireless traffic. We study the inherent vulnerabilities of the considered method through real-life experimental tests by setting up specific attack scenarios, and we devise and test a solution in order to improve the efficiency of the proposed technique in the presence of malicious countermeasures. Results show that the proposed improved detection technique is indeed robust to stealth attacks, and it is able to achieve very good recognition performance in different real-life testing scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Location Fingerprinting (LF) is a promising localization technique that enables many commercial and emergency Location-Based Services (LBS). The idea of this paper is two- folded. First, a Gaussian Process (GP) is used during the training (offline) phase of an indoor positioning algorithm to generate the fingerprint database, reducing the expensive labor of acquiring and maintaining the fingerprint database significantly. Furthermore, during the positioning (online) phase, a Smart algorithm (already proposed in [1]) is used for reducing the computation effort for positioning calculation. We call our idea Smart<sup>2</sup> since it enhances the advantages of the base Smart approach. Specifically, Smart<sup>2</sup> reduces the labor during the offline phase by trading it with a small positioning error and, at the same time, it limits the energy consumption in the online phase without incurring in any additional accuracy detriment.",

      "abstract": "Rehabilitation and elderly monitoring for active aging can benefit from Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities in particular for in-home treatments. In this paper, we consider two functions useful for such treatments: 1) activity recognition (AR) and 2) movement recognition (MR). The former is aimed at detecting if a patient is idle, still, walking, running, going up/down the stairs, or cycling; the latter individuates specific movements often required for physical rehabilitation, such as arm circles, arm presses, arm twist, curls, seaweed, and shoulder rolls. Smartphones are the reference platforms being equipped with an accelerometer sensor and elements of the IoT. The work surveys and compares accelerometer signals classification methods to enable IoT for the aforementioned functions. The considered methods are support vector machines (SVMs), decision trees, and dynamic time warping. A comparison of the methods has been proposed to highlight their performance: all the techniques have good recognition accuracies and, among them, the SVM-based approaches show an accuracy above 90% in the case of AR and above 99% in the case of MR.",

      "abstract": "The exponential increase in the number and types of mobile devices, along with their ever-growing sets of capabilities, have enabled the development of new architectures that aim to harness such heterogeneity. Transient clouds are examples of mobile clouds, which are created on-the-fly by the devices present in an environment to share their physical resources (e.g. CPU, memory and network) and would disappear as the nodes leave the network. They enable a device to go beyond its own physical limitations through utilising the capabilities offered by nearby devices over an ad hoc network. This idea exploits the device-to-device (D2D) communications paradigm, which allows two nearby devices to communicate with each other in the licenced cellular bandwidth without a base station involved. In this paper, we present a transient context-aware cloud (TCAC) paradigm based on the assumption that the nodes of the network care more about providing/learning higher level functionalities rather than lower level capabilities in D2D scenario. The proposed architecture, realised by using a WiFi Direct, can be portable through any paradigm, which exploits the D2D communications, so opening the doors to forthcoming 5G scenarios. We present a prototype implementation of our architecture over Android smartphones connected via WiFi Direct along with the performance metrics (power/energy consumption and accuracy) to show the benefits of TCAC. A theoretical and analytical model for the energy consumption related to a device within the TCAC is provided as well. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

      "abstract": "The treatments for brain stroke are strongly timedependent. The medical literature highlights the need of a quick diagnosis in order to guarantee the most effective therapy. An important target for strokes is trying to achieve a Door-to-Needle (DTN) time of less than 60 minutes, which is called Golden Hour [1]. This paper proposes a mobile Smart Helmet (SH) thought to be worn by a patient when the first aid medical team arrives and the aim is to efficiently recognize and detect a brain stroke, on site. While similar solutions in the literature employ the (usually computationally heavy) electromagnetic field inversion problem and image analysis, the proposal of this paper is an NN-based SH. It uses signal analysis to recognize the presence of a stroke with a limited computational burden. In the reported preliminary experiments, carried out via simulations, we have employed a MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) model that implements a 4-layer NN. Numerical results show that proposed signal analysis, applied to a single brain model, is able to efficiently detect the stroke presence with an accuracy around 90%.",

      "abstract": "Indoor navigation and localization are becoming fundamental services nowadays. WiFi-based solutions such as FingerPrinting (FP) are the most widely adopted techniques for positioning and provide better results if compared to other approaches. They require to compare WiFi Received Signal Strength (RSS) with an pre-computed radio map called fingerprint. The recently proposed Smart Probabilistic FingerPrinting (P-FP) algorithm reduces the computational complexity of the traditional FP approach without any accuracy detriment. On the other hand, fog computing has emerged as a new promising paradigm in the recent years, which extends traditional mobile cloud computing capabilities towards the edge of the network and enables location-Aware services. In this paper we propose to offload Smart P-FP computation over a fog platform exploiting a novel distributed algorithm. Performance evaluation validates the effectiveness of the proposed approach with the analysis of: i) the amount of power saved and ii) the efficiency of candidate selection process for offloading. Having 2 or more devices in the vicinity contributing to the computation makes offloading beneficial from a power standpoint. The offloading effectiveness increases with the number of devices willing to contribute and the amount of data to be transferred. Power savings can be as high as 80% if compared with local computation.",

      "abstract": "Recently the problem of interconnecting Internet of Things nodes when they are dispersed over wide geographical areas has been highlighted: This is the Internet of Remote Things (IoRT). It could be able to play a key role in disaster recovery scenarios (e.g., earthquakes, flash floods, terrorist attacks, etc.), where the presence of a communication infrastructure enabling video transmissions from the emergency areas is crucial. Local communications can be provided by incident area networks, while satellite communication systems can bridge the gap toward external networks. In this context, we propose a cooperative resource allocation mechanism, which exploits feedback from links conditions and knowledge of the adaptive coding, allowing a higher quality and more fair experience for all nodes of the IoRT transmitting videos. We implemented each element of the mentioned scenario over an emulation platform to prove the concept and show the obtained benefits.",

Preliminary numerical results concerning the reconstruction of a simulated stroke inside a two-dimensional slice of the human head are reported.

In more detail, the work is focused on the Movement Recognition (MR) functionality of the aforementioned platform. It compares algorithms, which process the signal provided by the embedded accelerometer sensor of the smartphone, able to recognize if a patient had performed the movements requested by the physicians. The provided performance comparison of different MR techniques shows that Support Vector Machine-based approaches have very good accuracy (up to 99.3%), thus making the in-home physical therapy reliable.",

      "abstract": "This paper tackles the classical problem of transmission rate allocation in satellite networks where fading may negatively impact communications. Within the framework of multiobjective programming (MOP), this paper introduces a transmission rate allocation criterion among Earth stations (ESs) called L<inf>p</inf>-problem-based rate allocation (L<inf>p</inf>RA). The allocations provided by L<inf>p</inf>RA are representative of a compromise among the need of different performance metrics such as packet loss and transmission power (TP). This paper determines the condition for the existence and the value of a L<inf>p</inf>RA transmission rate allocation bound R to which the transmission rate globally allocated by L<inf>p</inf> RA converges when the overall available transmission rate R mathrm <inf>TOT</inf> tends to infinity. The performance analysis, which is carried out through simulations under different satellite channel conditions, is aimed at investigating L<inf>p</inf>RA features, at showing the existence of the rate bound and the advantages concerning the rate allocation given by using L<inf>p</inf>RA, and at comparing L<inf>p</inf>RA with two other schemes in the literature concerning allocated rate, packet loss rate, transmit power, and execution time.",

In this paper, a speaker recognition system for MDs based on a multiple-observations approach is presented. We propose different fusion and clustering algorithms aimed at efficiently exploiting signals coming from multiple sensors. Numerical results show that in most cases our multiple-observations approach is able to significantly improve the performance of a single- receiver approach.",

      "abstract": "This paper focuses on countering data hiding in images. Specifically, we refer to the active warden problem, a process which aims at disrupting the covert communications that are possibly taking place within host media. Although this has been extensively studied in the literature, typical state of the art approaches treat the hidden message as a noise-like component, proposing de- noising techniques, lossy compression or noise addition as a countermeasure. In this paper we present novel approach called Lesser Components Distortion (LCD) that aims at disrupting the covert communication while minimizing distortion on the host medium. Although stemming from insights gained from notable works in the spread spectrum steganography field, we prove through extensive testing that it shows remarkable effectiveness against steganographic techniques in general, compared to common attacks.",

Heuristic-ALJC includes also a simple acknowledgement based adaptation of the transmission rate and acts on the basis of feedback information about the overall network status estimated in terms of maximum allowable network throughput and link quality (lossiness). Heuristic-ALJC is implemented through two smartphone Apps (transmitter and receiver) and is suitable to be employed to transmit video streams over networks based on time varying and possibly lossy channels. A performance investigation, carried out through a real implementation of the Apps over Android smartphones, compares Heuristic-ALJC with static schemes.",

A system able to detect Indoor/Outdoor state switching can give useful information to upper-level applications permitting to improve their performance or reduce the computational load and consequently the lifetime of the smartphone. A localization application may exploit the Indoor/Outdoor information to smartly decide if using GPS (that performs well outdoors but poorly indoors) or other localization methods. In this paper we present an ultrasonic-signal-based Indoor/Outdoor detector for smartphones. The phone plays an ultrasonic ping by using its in-built speakers and records the echoes by using its microphone, therefore, no specific hardware is required to be added to the smartphone. The proposed detector shows good performance in terms of accuracy and latency.",

All these recognition functions are performed simultaneously by using unsupervised Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. An innovative point of this paper lies in the automatic re-training of the employed SVMs which are able to dynamically update themselves when a (new) audio from a (new) speaker is provided. This allow to build more robust classifiers, which results in better recognition performances. In terms of accuracy, the GR reaches about 98% of correct classifications, SR performs around 80% while LR shows an accuracy of about 74%.",

Unfortunately, satellite channels may be affected by attenuation and fading, causing significant and frequent variations of the link quality. For this reason, static compression, coding and resource allocation are not optimal solutions to guarantee a satisfactory level of Quality of Experience: we propose to apply two techniques: i) a dynamic transmission rate allocation able to assign resources to the links according to their conditions; ii) an application layer joint coder for video transmission capable of adaptively compressing and protecting the transmitted video frames so recovering losses.

      "abstract": "Heart failure is a chronic disease that alternates intense and weak phases and requires repeated and frequent hospital treatments. The use of automatic instruments for a remote and ubiquitous monitoring of biological parameters relevant to heart failure pathophysiology offers new perspectives to improve the patients' quality of life and the efficacy of the treatment. The platform described in this paper represents an implementation of an automatic remote monitoring tool where smartphones play a crucial role. They are not employed just to communicate through traditional client-server applications and they are not only the hub of information sent by sensors, but they also act as intelligent processors and autonomous sensors of the patients' motion through a high-accuracy activity recognition algorithm. The proposed platform combines the evolution of health systems and the consequent needs of modern telemedicine with the current context-aware capability of recent smartphones, obtained by implementing specific algorithmic solutions, and with the anything, anytime, and anywhere communication capability of the pervasive communications paradigm. Performance evaluation focuses on the accuracy of the activity recognition estimation, on its applicability to real life, and on the data exchange between smartphones and medical server, allowing to envisage the potential of the designed platform.",

      "abstract": "This chapter contains the description of a simulative/emulative platform developed by the authors and called the \"Hybrid Simulative-Emulative Platform (HySEP).\" It has been designed and built to simulate long term evolution (LTE) networks by using Network Simulator 3 (ns-3) and to emulate a backhaul network that implements the Differentiated Service (DiffServ) solution to guarantee Quality of Service (QoS). The former composes the Simulated Network Segment (SNS), the latter the Emulated Network Segment (ENS). The use of ns-3 assures a detailed LTE simulative model and an effective mechanism to connect the simulated scenario with real network nodes and links. Moreover, this platform enables the creation of a heterogeneous network through the exploitation of personal computers and free software without using any ad-hoc hardware. HySEP makes possible testing different network configurations, limiting costs and using technologies such as LTE whose real implementation is hardly applicable inside a research laboratory. The tool can be completely configured and used remotely through Internet connections.",

      "abstract": "A method exploiting the audio-visual correlation of speech in order to estimate the lip and mouth movements is presented. Its applications are in the field of aids and services for elderly people, in videotelephony, in cartoons and movie dubbing. Notice that lip movements synthesis does not imply speech recognition and that the mouth shape is not only specified by the phoneme currently uttered but it also depends on some past and future speech information. In order to take into account this temporal correlation, and considering the constraint of computational effectiveness, the Time Delay Neural Networks (TDNNs) seem to be the most appropriate analysis tool in comparison with methods like Markov Models, which are more resource consuming.",

      "abstract": "The exponential increase in the number and types of mobile devices, along with their ever-growing sets of capabilities, have enabled the development of new architectures that aim to harness such heterogeneity. Transient Clouds (TCs) are examples of mobile clouds which are created on-the-fly by the devices present in an environment to share their physical resources (e.g., CPU, memory, network) and would disappear as the nodes leave the network. They enable a device to go beyond its own physical limitations through utilizing the capabilities offered by nearby devices over an ad-hoc network. In this paper we present a Transient Context-Aware Cloud (TCAC) in which the nodes of the network care more about providing/learning higher level functionalities rather than lower level capabilities. We make the case for such an architecture in scenarios where it is not feasible for all the nodes to compute the context due to privacy, energy, and delay constraints rather than an unreachable network.We present a prototype implementation of our architecture over Android smartphones connected via WiFi along with the performance metrics (power/energy consumption and accuracy)to show the benefits of context awareness in TCs.",

      "abstract": "Recently, patients suffering from a set of physical and mental limitations, called co-morbidities, are often treated at home. In this environment, modern communication systems represent a great support to implement Ambient Assisted Living platforms aimed at monitoring patients at home because they enable the seamless integration of heterogeneous sensing units, medical devices, and ubiquitous access to data. This article describes a specific smartphone-centric architecture where smartphones are employed not only as hubs of the health information but also as sensing, processing, and transmitting devices. Smartphones have both short-range (Bluetooth and WiFi employed for local information exchange) and long-range (GPRS, 3G/4G, and WiFi employed as Internet access) communication capabilities; information processing capabilities offered by modern platforms often equipped with different CPUs and with flexible and efficient software; and sensing capabilities implemented through sensors embedded into smartphones such as GPS receivers, accelerometers, microphones, and radio interfaces or through external sensors added to smartphones by cables or connected through local radio interfaces. The specific case of co-morbidities considered in this article implies the necessity to acquire a heterogeneous set of data from patients and from their environment. For this reason this article highlights the information processing capabilities of the introduced smartphone-centric platform. Audio, localization, and movement information processing have been evidenced as well as the specific implementations of these capabilities and their performance.",

      "abstract": "Recently, people have been interested in sharing what they are watching on TV, allowing the development of Social TV Applications often based on mobile devices. In this context, this paper proposes IRTR (Improved Real-Time TV-channel Recognition): a new method aimed at recognizing in real time (live) what people are watching on TV without any active user interaction. IRTR uses the audio signal of the TV program recorded by smartphones and is performed through two steps: i) fingerprint extraction and ii) TV channel real-time identification. Step i) is based on the computation of the Audio Fingerprint (AF). The AF computation has been taken from the literature and has been improved in terms of power consumption and computation speed to make the smartphone implementation feasible by using an ad hoc cost function aimed at selecting the best set of AF parameters. Step ii) is aimed at deciding the TV channel the user is watching. This step is performed using a likelihood estimation algorithm proposed in this paper. The consumed power, computation and response time, and correct decision rate of IRTR, evaluated through experimental measures, show very satisfying results such as a correct decision rate of about 95%, about 2 s of computation time, and above 90% power saving with respect to the literature.",

      "abstract": "Often copyrighted multimedia files are uploaded and shared online. To avoid the unregulated spread of such material many copy detectors have been developed in order to deny the possibility to upload, and consequently make available, copies of copyrighted contents. A widely referenced fingerprint method for content-based audio identification is the Philips Robust Hash (PRH). This paper introduces a simple but effective attack technique capable to defeat a PRH fingerprint-based audio copy detector without significantly affecting the signal quality. It is a heuristic method that adds a suitable distortion to the original audio signal, so that the modified signal is not detected as a copy of the original one but is perceptively very similar to it. The quality of the modified signal has been evaluated in terms of a distortion measure based on a mathematical model of the human auditory system and of the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). The attack method has shown a promising success rate.",

      "abstract": "Assuring a satisfactory level of Quality of Experience (QoE) to users is nowadays an important challenge for network service providers. At the same time, power consumption minimization is another important issue for network management. Consequently, the ideal goal is to maximize the QoE and, meanwhile, to minimize the power transmitted by network nodes. In telecommunications networks QoE is often linked to the transmission rate assured to a given application. Actually higher guaranteed transmission rate, lower packet loss, delay and jitter, which have a direct impact on QoE. In this view the requirement of maximizing QoE and minimizing power consumption conflict with each other because higher is the transmit rate better the QoE but higher required transmitted power. By taking the session time of a web navigation as a reference metric, in this paper, the authors propose a transmission rate allocation algorithm for satellite networks aimed at finding a satisfactory compromise between QoE and Transmitted Power (TP). Earth stations communicate with a satellite by using a common channel with an overall available transmission rate of R<inf>TOT</inf>. The allocation algorithm is formulated starting from the Multi Objective Programming theory and the L<inf>p</inf>-problem and it is called L<inf>p</inf>-problem based Rate Allocation (L<inf>p</inf>RA). Numerical results show that L<inf>p</inf>RA assures satisfying operative compromise between QoE improvement and power saving.",

      "abstract": "Indoor localization of targets by using electromagnetic waves has attracted a lot of attention in the last few years. Thanks to the wide availability of electromagnetic sources deployed for various applications (e.g., WiFi), nowadays it is possible to perform this task by using low-cost mobile devices, such as smartphones. To this end, in order to achieve high positioning accuracy and reduce the computational resources used in the position estimation, fingerprinting approaches are usually employed. However, in this case, a time-consuming training phase, where a great number of measurements must be performed, is needed. In this letter, a novel approach, where the training data are obtained by means of finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations of the electromagnetic propagation in the considered scenario, is presented. The performances of the method are assessed by means of experimental results in a real scenario. © 2002-2011 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Telemedicine applications provide healthcare services through communications technologies overcoming the geographical separation between patients and caregivers. These services can be provided via wireless devices, such as smart-phones with dedicated applications. An interesting application concerns the so-called situation awareness algorithms and, in particular, the Activity Recognition (AR) aimed at tracking the physical activity (or movements) of patients that need a constant monitoring of their medical conditions. This work takes as reference an architecture applicable, but not limited to, patients suffering from Heart Failure (HF) and presents a performance comparison between AR approaches based on the accelerometer signal captured through the patients' smartphones. In more detail, the considered AR techniques apply two different classifiers used to decide the patients movements: a J48 decision tree and a Support Vector Machine (SVM). For each classifier, three different features sets, characterizing the accelerometer signal, have been employed. The performance are evaluated both in terms of accuracy-related metrics and time needed by each classifiers to perform the decision. The results show that SVM provides the best accuracy while the J48 requires less classification time.",

      "abstract": "The Vertical Handover and the related Network Selection process play a fundamental role in supporting reliable communications over MANETs. The goal of the Network Selection is to determine the Radio Access Network (RAN) that a Mobile Node (MN) has to use among several available RANs. This decision process finds out the RAN that fits the MN requirements and has to provide the decision as rapidly as possible. A computationally heavy Network Selection algorithm can impact the whole handover process because it waits until the selection is carried out. This waste of time can have negative consequences in the quality of communications. The main contribution of this paper is the definition of a new Network Selection algorithm based on a different formulation of the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method found in the literature, called Dynamic-TOPSIS (D-TOPSIS). It is aimed at performing the same selection of the TOPSIS but with a significant reduction of necessary computational load. Finally, the numerical results highlight the execution time reduction obtained by applying the D-TOPSIS with respect to the standard algorithm, and other Network Selection techniques usually applied within Vertical Handover Processes. © 2014 IEEE.",

In this context, efficient solutions for heterogeneous and mobile networks, including satellite portions that allows wide coverages, represents a key issue. In the mentioned scenario, transmitting video with portable devices (such as smartphone), over terrestrial/satellite networks, to a Remote Monitoring Host (RMH) may support emergency and rescue operations after crisis situations. Unfortunately heterogeneity often implies impairments such as packet losses, due to errors and congestion, which negatively affect the video quality. We present an application layer joint coding algorithm for video transmission, that adaptively applies video compression and channel coding at the application layer, on the basis of the overall network condition estimated in terms of maximum allowable throughput of the network and quality (packet cancellations or lossiness). A deep performance investigation, carried out with real implementation of the algorithm, compares the joint coding against fixed schemes and shows that the joint approach adapt the video transmission to terrestrial/satellite emergency networks so allowing a more efficient resource exploitation. © 2014 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes a system that allows recognizing a person's emotional state starting from audio signal registrations. The provided solution is aimed at improving the interaction among humans and computers, thus allowing effective human-computer intelligent interaction. The system is able to recognize six emotions (anger, boredom, disgust, fear, happiness, and sadness) and the neutral state. This set of emotional states is widely used for emotion recognition purposes. It also distinguishes a single emotion versus all the other possible ones, as proven in the proposed numerical results. The system is composed of two subsystems: 1) gender recognition (GR) and 2) emotion recognition (ER). The experimental analysis shows the performance in terms of accuracy of the proposed ER system. The results highlight that the a priori knowledge of the speaker's gender allows a performance increase. The obtained results show also that the features selection adoption assures a satisfying recognition rate and allows reducing the employed features. Future developments of the proposed solution may include the implementation of this system over mobile devices such as smartphones.",

For example, a speech-to-text application is software that allows the device to translate the spoken words into text. These tools translate explicit messages but ignore implicit messages, such as the emotional status of the speaker, filtering out a portion of information available in the interaction process. This chapter focuses on emotion detection. An emotion-aware device can also interact more personally with its owner and react appropriately according to the user's mood, making the user-machine interaction less stressful. The chapter gives the guidelines for building emotion-aware smartphone applications in an opportunistic way (i.e., without the user's collaboration). In general, smartphone applications might be employed in different contexts; therefore, the to-be-detected emotions might be different.",

      "abstract": "In this paper a performance comparison of a probabilistic Gaussian-Kernel fingerprint-based indoor positioning method over different smartphones, is presented. The work aims at highlighting the positioning accuracy, the robustness and the consistency of the method by testing it over two different smartphone platforms (i.e., Nokia N95 and Samsung Galaxy S II), within a given area. In more detail, three different variants of the probabilistic approach have been tested: Nearest Neighbor (NN), K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) and K Weighted-Nearest Neighbor (KW-NN). Numerical experiments, carried out in an area of around 80 [m<sup>2</sup>], have shown that the probabilistic fingerprint provides good position accuracy (less than 1.20 [m] of error) for both devices and also robustness when the signal strength acquisitions are reduced. Finally, the similarity of results provided by the two smartphones leads to assert that the probabilistic approach is also consistent with respect to the device employed in the experiments. © 2013 Society for Modeling & Simulation International.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes a new location recognition algorithm for automatic check-in applications (LRACI), suited to be implemented within Smartphones, integrated in the Cloud platform and representing a service for Cloud end users. The algorithm, the performance of which is independent of the employed device, uses both global and hybrid positioning systems (GPS/HPS) and, in an opportunistic way, the presence of Wi-Fi access points (APs), through a new definition of Wi-Fi FingerPrint (FP), which is proposed in this paper. This FP definition considers the order relation among the received signal strength (RSS) rather than the absolute values. This is one of the main contributions of this paper. LRACI is designed to be employed where traditional approaches, usually based only on GPS/HPS, fail, and is aimed at finding user location, with a room-level resolution, in order to estimate the overall time spent in the location, called Permanence, instead of the simple presence. LRACI allows automatic check-in in a given location only if the users' Permanence is larger than a minimum amount of time, called Stay Length (SL), and may be exploited in the Cloud. For example, if many people check-in in a particular location (e.g., a supermarket or a post office), it means that the location is crowded. Using LRACI-based data, collected by smartphones in the Cloud and made available in the Cloud itself, end users can manage their daily activities (e.g., buying food or paying a bill) in a more efficient way. The proposal, practically implemented over Android operating system-based Smartphones, has been extensively tested. Experimental results have shown a location recognition accuracy of about 90%, opening the door to real LRACI employments. In this sense, a preliminary study of its application in the Cloud, obtained through simulation, has been provided to highlight the advantages of the LRACI features. © 1999-2012 IEEE.",

The work proposes a simple algebraic approach aimed at reducing the computational and energy loads of the probabilistic fingerprinting, which is employed to carry out the position of a smartphone on the basis of the captured WiFi Access Points signal strengths in an indoor area. The presented solution does not apply any kind of approximation with respect to the traditional approach, so avoiding accuracy detriment. The idea is to factoring out the parts of the probabilistic fingerprint formulae that can be computed a-priori, so reducing the computational burden of the positioning process. The paper also highlights the effectiveness of the proposed solution by evaluating the energy saved in comparison with the traditional approach. The obtained results, collected by testing three different smartphones, show that our approach allows saving a significant quantity of energy so increasing the smartphones battery lifetime.",

In more detail, we consider the case in which different performance metrics, such as Packet Loss and Power, are simultaneously taken into account. Starting from the wide literature in the field, this work tries to categorize the available and well-known resource allocation approaches into three groups: i) the capacity maximization with constrained power group, ii) the power minimization with constrained capacity group and iii) the multi-objective programming group. For each group a general mathematical formulation has been proposed and the main differences among the groups have been highlighted. The performance of the three listed groups are compared through simulations where two Earth Stations, afflicted by different fading conditions, have been considered. The comparison takes into account all the mentioned metrics (i.e., loss and power) and the computational complexity of the allocation approaches. © 2013 IEEE.",

Moreover, the wide spread adoption of Smartphones, usually equipped with powerful processors, accelerometers, compasses, and Global and Hybrid Positioning Systems (GPS/HPSs) receivers, has favored the increasing of location- and context-based services over the last years. In this work a Wi-Fi fingerprint-based indoor positioning techniques is considered. It is aimed at supporting possible location aware services. The main novelty introduced in this paper concerns the training phase, which is usually needed by these techniques. In our approach, the training phase is avoided, since opportune simulative propagation models of the environment in which the algorithm are working are introduced. The resulting technique allows exploiting the accuracy of the fingerprinting approaches and, simultaneously, avoids the heavy training phase, which represents one of the main drawbacks of such techniques. © 2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Recent multimedia and location-based services (LBSs) employ information about location, orientation and context of a mobile device. Moreover, the wide spread adoption of Smartphones, usually equipped with powerful processors, accelerometers, compasses and Global and Hybrid Positioning Systems (GPS/HPSs) receivers, has favored the increasing of location- and context-based services over the last years. In this work a novel Location Recognition approach aimed at supporting location aware services, in particular Check-In services, is presented. The proposed method uses both the GPS/HPS positioning information and, in an opportunistic way, the presence of Wi-Fi Access Points (APs). The method is based on the concept of radio FingerPrint (FP) whose definition proposed in this paper, to the best of authors' knowledge, has never been applied previously. The method is suited to be employed where traditional approaches - usually based only on GPS/HPS - fail, as in case of indoor or dense urban environments. Finally, the proposal, practically realized over different Android OS Smartphones, has been tested in terms of performance. The experimental results are very satisfying and open the doors to a wide employment of the method. © 2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Television audience estimation is an important task for advertisement placement. In this paper we present a system based on a client-server architecture able to recognize a live television show. The clients are implemented throughout smartphones, thus a well known audio fingerprint algorithm has been modified to fit smartphone needs. To reach this aim, the optimization of an ad-hoc cost function has been introduced. Server and client are generally far from being synchronized, due to the variety of broadcasting media (aerial, satellite or streaming over the Internet) leading to different and unpredictable delays. For this reason, we present a new likelihood estimate designed to overcome the lack of synchronization issue. © 2012 Society for Modeling & Sim.",

      "abstract": "In the framework of health remote monitoring applications for individuals with disabilities or particular pathologies, quantity and type of physical activity performed by an individual/patient constitute important information. On the other hand, the technological evolution of Smartphones, combined with their increasing diffusion, gives mobile network providers the opportunity to offer real-time services based on captured real world knowledge and events. This paper presents a Smartphone-based Activity Recognition (AR) method based on decision tree classification of accelerometer signals to classify the user's activity as Sitting, Standing, Walking or Running. The main contribution of the work is a method employing a novel windowing technique which reduces the rate of accelerometer readings while maintaining high recognition accuracy by combining two single-classification weighting policies. The proposed method has been implemented on Android OS smartphones and experimental tests have produced satisfying results. It represents a useful solution in the aforementioned health remote applications such as the Heart Failure (HF) patients monitoring mentioned below.",

Among these are the context-aware ones, highly customizable services tailored to the user's preferences and needs and relying on the real-time knowledge of the smartphone's surroundings, without requiring complex configuration on the user's part. Examples of context-aware services are profile changes as a result of context changes, proximity-based advertising or media content tagging, etc. The contribution of this chapter is to propose a survey of several methods to extract context information, by employing a smartphone, based on Digital Signal Processing and Pattern Recognition approaches, aimed at answering to the following questions about the user's surroundings: what, who, where, when, why and how.

      "abstract": "In deep communications systems bandwidth availability, storage and computational capacity play a crucial role and represent precious, as well as limited, communications resources. Starting from this consideration, high efficient image compression coding algorithms may represent a key solution to optimize the resources employment. In this paper two possible approaches have been considered: JPEG2000 and CCSDS Image Compression, which is specifically designed for satellite and deep space communications. In more details, two coders have been compared in terms of performance: JasPer, which is an implementation of the JPEG2000 standards, and the BPE, which is based on the CCSDS recommendations. The proposed comparison takes into account both the quality of the compressed images, by evaluating the Peak Signal to Noise Ratio, and the time needed to compress the images: the Compression Time. The latter parameters, which concerns the computational complexity of the compression algorithm, is very interesting for deep space systems because of their limited computational and energy resources. © 2010 Institute for Computer Sciences, Social-Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.",

It recognizes when the devices are in the same area, and, in this case, it distinguishes three proximity levels: High (e.g. same room), Medium (e.g. same floor) and Low (e.g. same building). The algorithm can be deployed on a remote server that receives Wi-Fi scanning data (including MAC addresses and signal strength) from mobile devices. The server estimates proximity by extracting a set of features from each received pair of Wi-Fi data, feeding them to the GMM model and selecting the category with greatest probability. The method presented in the paper does not require calibration and leverages on existing Wi-Fi signals, while obtaining a percentage of correct discrimination among three levels near to 90%.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we describe a method for fast determination of distortion-based optimal unequal error protection (UEP) of bitstreams generated by embedded image coders and transmitted over memoryless noisy channels. The UEP problem is reduced to the more general problem of finding a path in a graph, where each path of the graph represents a possible protection policy, with the objective of selecting the best path being that one inducing minimal distortion. The problem is combinatorially complex and excludes a brute force approach. The solution is provided by applying heuristic information from the problem domain to reduce search complexity. In particular, we use graph search procedure A suggested by Hart et al., well known in the field of artificial intelligence, to avoid exhaustive search. Numerical results show that this technique outperforms the method presented by Hamzaoui et al., in terms of Mean Square Error (MSE) distortion and computational complexity. After testing our solution using analytical models of the operational distortion curves proposed by Charfi et al., we implement a transmission architecture that, using the actual distortion values generated by a real embedded coder, computes the optimal protection policy for the considered image, protects the packets, and transmits them over a channel. © 2008 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel approach to energy efficient data transmission based on radio link estimation and adaptive channel coding. A channel protection algorithm is proposed to achieve efficient transmission (in terms of Bit Error Rate), while reducing as much as possible power consumption and transmission bandwidth. The algorithm has been implemented and integrated within an experimental set-up based on a narrow band \"ad hoc\" network. It has been evaluated through field trials carried out in a hilly region with terrain characteristics that reproduce a variety of situations. The adopted simplified propagation model is based on the well-known knife-edge approximation while the radio link budget is computed by the mobile terminals thanks to 3D map information locally available. The level of channel protection is adaptively matched to the estimated radio link by tuning the transmission parameters and by configuring the Reed-Solomon protection code.

      "abstract": "Talking virtual characters are graphical simulations of real or imaginary persons that enable natural and pleasant multimodal interaction with the user, by means of voice, eye gaze, facial expression and gestures. This paper presents an implementation of a 3D virtual character animation and rendering engine, compliant with the MPEG-4 standard, running on Symbian-based SmartPhones. Real-time animation of virtual characters on mobile devices represents a challenging task, since many limitations must be taken into account with respect to processing power, graphics capabilities, disk space and execution memory size. The proposed optimization techniques allow to overcome these issues, guaranteeing a smooth and synchronous animation of facial expressions and lip movements on mobile phones such as Sony-Ericsson's P800 and Nokia's 6600. The animation engine is specifically targeted to the development of new \"Over The Air\" services, based on embodied conversational agents, with applications in entertainment (interactive story tellers), navigation aid (virtual guides to web sites and mobile services), news casting (virtual newscasters) and education (interactive virtual teachers). © 2005 SPIE and IS&T,.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, a complete Smart Space architecture and related system prototype are presented. The system is able to analyze situations of interest in a given environment and to produce related contextual information. Experimental results show that video information plays a major role for what concerns both situation perception and personalized contex-aware communications. For this reason, the poropsed multisensor system automatically extracts information from multiple cameras as well as diverse sensors describing environment status. This information is then used to trigger personalized and context-aware video messages adaptively sent to users. A rule-based module is encharged to customize video messages in relation to the user profile, contextual situation and users's terminal. The systems outputs graphically generated video messages consisting of an animated avatar (i.e. Virtual Character) closing the loop on users. Proposed results validate the conceptual schema behind the architecture and the successful adaption to the analysis of different situations.",

      "abstract": "Non-verbal behaviors have a key role in making a Virtual Character appear life-like. We describe an extensible system for the specification, control and real-time generation of facial expressions and gestures. The system approximates in a MPEG-4 based Virtual Character the wide expressive range, dynamism (an expression's meaning significantly depends on its temporal evolution) and variability (an emotion is never expressed exactly in the same way by different people, and even by the same person at different times), typical of human non-verbal behavior. The MPEG-4 standard only allows high-level control of 6 basic emotions, and does not explicitly support the description of an expression temporal evolution. Our approach has been that of creating a hierarchical model of expressiveness; expressions are defined in term of parameterized functions controlling low-level animation parameters trajectories (by means of an XML-based Expression Definition Markup Language). The real-time generation of those expressions is performed by an Expression Synthesis Engine. The system allows to effectively modulate expressivity both at design-time (the developer tweaks the parameters to give the character a given expressive style), and at run-time (the engine automatically changes the way in which an expression is performed each time), producing controllable, but non-deterministic, behavior patterns, a key factor for enhancing believability.",

      "abstract": "In this paper the complete framework of a software package for real-time animation of 3D facial models according to the MPEG-4 specifications is described. The focus is mainly on the algorithmic solution that has been adopted for scaling the polygon mesh to a level of complexity suited to the specific hw/sw profile of the platform that hosts the decoder. The basic functionality of this system is its ability to deform virtual faces in response to MPEG-4 Facial Animation Parameters (FAP) according to \"animation rules\" whose computation is based on very simple \"semantic\" information previously associated with the model. The software architecture is modular and each module, implementing a specific functionality, can be easily plugged in or unplugged. In this paper, we begin with a general presentation of the system and then we present a brief description of its main modules: the face model, the mesh animation, the mesh calibration, the mesh simplification and the FAP decoding. While for the other modules a deeper analysis is left to referenced bibliography previously published by the authors, a comprehensive description is given here of the mesh simplification block together with experimental evidence of its efficiency. The algorithm we have adopted for mesh simplification is based on iterative edge contraction with the introduction of specific geometry constraints due to the particular nature of the 3D mesh representing an MPEG-4 animated face. In this paper it will be shown how rather complex 3D facial models, optionally textured, can be simplified in real-time in order to adapt the rendering performance to the hardware capabilities, whilst still maintaining compliance with the MPEG-4 specifications on facial animation. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The proposed algorithm is based on a comprehensive analysis of the cross-correlation properties that characterize FAPs, which is here reported and discussed extensively. Based on this analysis, a subset of ten almost independent FAPs has been selected from the full set of 66 low-level FAPs to be transmitted and used at the decoder to interpolate the remaining ones. The performances achievable through the proposed algorithm have been evaluated objectively by means of conventional PSNR measures and compared to an alternative solution based on the increase of the quantization scale factor used for FAP encoding. The subjective evaluation and comparison of the results has also been made possible by uploading mpg movies on a freely accessible web site (referenced in the bibliography). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed FAP interpolation algorithm allows efficient parameter encoding at around 70 bits/frame or, in other words, at less than 2 kbits/s for smooth synthetic video at 25 frames/s.",

The INTERFACE objective is that of integrating all these analysis/synthesis techniques into a single piece of technology capable of accepting queries through talk and facial expressions, as we are used to do in everyday life with relatives, friends and colleagues, and of providing answers to the user through virtual actors capable of reproducing artificially human voice and gestures. The INTERFACE achievements have been recently demonstrated with live demos during international exhibitions and conferences.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a method for implementing a high-level interface for the synthesis and animation of animated virtual faces that is in full compliance with MPEG-4 specifications. This method allows us to implement the simple facial object profile and part of the calibration facial object profile. In fact, starting from a facial wireframe and from a set of configuration files, the developed system is capable of automatically generating the animation rules suited for model animation driven by a stream of facial animation parameters. If the calibration parameters (feature points and texture) are available, the system is able to exploit this information for suitably modifying the geometry of the wireframe and for performing its animation by means of calibrated rules computed ex novo on the adapted somatics of the model. Evidence of the achievable performance is reported at the end of this paper by means of figures showing the capability of the system to reshape its geometry according to the decoded MPEG-4 facial calibration parameters and its effectiveness in performing facial expressions. © 1999 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, a new technology is proposed for audio-video synchronization in multimedia applications where talking human faces, either natural or synthetic, are employed for interpersonal communication services, home gaming, advanced multimodal interfaces, interactive entertainment, or in movie production. Facial sequences, in fact, represent an acoustic-visual source characterized by two strongly correlated components: a talking face and the associated speech, whose synchronous presentation must be guaranteed in any multimedia application. Therefore, the exact timing for displaying a video frame or for generating a synthetic facial image has to be supervised by some form of speech analysis performed either as preprocessing before encoding or as postprocessing before presentation. In this paper, experimental results are reported on the use of time-delay neural networks (TDNN) for the direct estimation of the visible articulation of the mouth (a set of features which describe the shape of the mouth) starting from the coherent analysis of acoustic speech. The architectural solution of employing a bank of independent single-output TDNN's has been compared to the alternative solution of using only a single multi-output TDNN. Similarly, two different learning procedures have been applied and compared for training the TDNN, the first based on the classic mean square error (MSE) and the second based on a measure of cross-correlation (CC). The superiority of the system based on multiple single-output TDNN's has been proved as well as the improvements, both in terms of convergence speed and estimation fidelity, achievable through the learning algorithm based on cross-correlation. In the opinion of the author, these results provide relevant hints to the comprehension of acoustic-visual correlation in speech and to the formalization of suitable nonlinear mechanisms for its coherent analysis. The possibility to estimate and synchronize the lip movements with the acoustic speech signal opens a wide spectrum of possible exploitations in multimedia applications like videoconferencing/videophone coding, automatic film dubbing, synthetic character animation, natural/synthetic hybrid video representation, speech rehabilitation, and language teaching. © 1997 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "MPEG-4 addresses coding of digital hybrids of natural and synthetic, aural and visual (A/V) information. The objective of this synthetic/natural hybrid coding (SNHC) is to facilitate content-based manipulation, interoperability, and wider user access in the delivery of animated mixed media. SNHC will support non-real-time and passive media delivery, as well as more interactive, real-time applications. Integrated spatial-temporal coding is sought for audio, video, and 2D/3D computer graphics as standardized A/V objects. Targets of standardization include mesh-segmented video coding, compression of geometry, synchronization between A/V objects, multiplexing of streamed A/V objects, and spatial-temporal integration of mixed media types. Composition, interactivity, and scripting of A/V objects can thus be supported in client terminals, as well as in content production for servers, also more effectively enabling terminals as servers. Such A/V objects can exhibit high efficiency in transmission and storage, plus content-based interactivity, spatial-temporal scalability, and combinations of transient dynamic data and persistent downloaded data. This approach can lower bandwidth of mixed media, offer tradeoffs in quality versus update for specific terminals, and foster varied distribution methods for content that exploit spatial and temporal coherence over buses and networks. MPEG-4 responds to trends at home and work to move beyond the paradigm of audio/video as a passive experience to more flexible A/V objects which combine audio/video with synthetic 2D/3D graphics and audio. © 1997 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.",

      "abstract": "Recent advances in joint acoustical/visual analysis for model-based lip motion synthesis is presented. The 2D lip motion field is modeled as a linear combination of a low dimensional motion basis computed through Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The vector of PCA coefficients is expressed as a function of a limited set of articulatory parameters which describe the external appearance of the mouth. The acoustical processing estimates these articulatory parameters from the direct analysis of the speech waveform based on a neural processing stage, i.e. through a bank of Time Delay Neural Networks. The achieved results have been subjectively evaluated by visualizing the estimated motion on a wire-frame mouth template presented in synchronization with speech. The experiments carried out so far deal with single-speaker trained TDNNs and with single-speaker PCA, but suitable algorithms for generalizing the techniques are currently under investigation.",

The 3D videophone scene is modeled in video (the talker's face) and in audio (the talker's speech), so that natural data can be efficiently mixed with synthetic data and adapted onto deformable parameterized structures. Robust image analysis/synthesis tools are necessary to extract the visual primitives associated to the talker's face and to adapt them onto suitable modeling structures (wire-frames).

The objective of the work has been that of integrating the unimodal audio information conveyed through acoustic speeech with coherent visual information associated to the movements of the speaker's mouth. Thanks to this integration, the occurrence of perceptive impairments affecting the auditory channel, i.e. environmental noise, age or handicaps, can be bypassed effectively through the visual modality. The described system implements a direct mapping from audio to visual parameters through two processing stages responsible of speech analysis and visual synthesis, respectively. The specific architecture employed for implementing the conversion structure, based on Time-Delay neural networks, has been chosen in consideration of the bimodal nature of speech and, in particular, of the complex coarticulation phenomena which require the integration of a given amount of past acoustic information before performing the visual conversion. Preliminary experimental results have reported showing the concrete possibility of providing new services in telecommunication and rehabilitation.",

The segmentation algorithm we propose relies on the recursive computation of the Spatial Gray Level Dependence Matrix (SGLDM) and on a fast adaptive procedure for the statistics evaluation.

Through the use of 1D orthogonal basis functions, the computational complexity which usually makes prohibitive most 2D region-oriented approaches is significantly reduced, while only a slight increment of distortion is introduced. With the aim of preserving the bidimensional intersample correlation of texture information as much as possible, suitable pseudo-bidimensional basis functions have been used, yielding significant improvements with respect to the straightforward 1D approach. The algorithm has been experimented with, for coding still images as well as motion compensated sequences, showing interesting possibilities of application for very low bit rate video coding. © 1994 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "This paper describes a new approach to very low bit-rate interpersonal visual communication based on a suitable scene model, i.e. a flexible structure adapted to the specific characteristics of the speaker's face. The face model is dynamically adapted to time-varying facial expressions by means of few parameters, estimated from the analysis of the real image sequence, which are used to apply knowledge-based deformation rules on a simplified muscle structure. Facial muscles are distributed in correspondence to the primary facial features and can be activated through the direct stimulation of each individual fiber or, indirectly, by interaction with adjacent stimulated fibers. The analysis algorithms performed at the transmitter to estimate the model parameters are based on feature-oriented operators aimed at segmenting the real incoming frames and at the extraction of the primary facial descriptors. The analysis/synthesis algorithms have been developed on a Silicon Graphics workstation and have been tested on various 'head-and-shoulder' sequences: the obtained results are very promising for applications both in videophone coding and in picture animation, where the facial expressions of a synthetic actor is reproduced according to the parameters extracted from a real speaking face. © 1994.",

The structure of the vector quantizer and the mechanisms for its construction and updating are based on a binary tree whose topology and content adaptively track the varying statistics of the incoming data. Some tree branches are extended more than others depending on the time varying distribution of the input vectors, to guarantee an acceptable reconstruction quality, not far from the target performances of a full search approach. The resulting bit-rate stems from several terms carrying information for both frame reconstruction and codebook updating. An effective policy for codebit allocation has been devised and tested providing very good results within fixed bit-rate applications. Exhaustive simulations have been carried out on standard sequences at a rate of 30 frames/sec with progressive transmission. An average reconstruction quality of 34.5 dB in the peak signal-to-noise ratio has been achieved for the luminance component at a constant bit-rate of 512 kbit/sec corresponding to a compression of 30:1 (0.26 bit/pixel). © 1993.",

Muscles can be activated through the direct stimulation of each individual fiber or, indirectly, by interaction with adjacent stimulated fibers. Through the analysis algorithms performed at the transmitter, the input video sequence is processed to extract a set of suitable facial control features and to estimate the muscle parameters. These parameters, namely the value of the estimated muscle stimula, are then quantized, coded and transmitted to the receiver where they are applied to the model to synthesize the corresponding facial expression. In the paper the muscle structure is described together with the coding/decoding algorithms which have been implemented on a multiprocessor AT&T Pixel Machine. Some samples of the achieved experimental results are also presented to show the significant subjective quality of the reconstructed sequence.",

      "abstract": "A significant amount of residual redundancy in vector quantized images can be further reduced by taking into accounts symmetries such as those presented by rotated or flipped versions of the same vector. Decorrelating data blocks with respect to this kind of symmetry allows for more efficient vector clustering, thus increasing the compression performances of the coder. In this paper an innovative though intuitively simple technique is presented for image vector quantization operating on a symmetry folded space. The symmetry invariance of the vector space is obtained by rotating and flipping each block in order to minimize a suitable functional: by means of this normalization procedures, rotated or flipped versions of the same block are mapped onto the same point in the folded space, thus clustering together previously scattered vectors. Fewer bits are therefore needed to quantize the redistributed vectors without increasing the level of distortion or, conversely, a lower distortion is achieved with unchanged bit rate. In order to invert the normalization procedure, some side information must be delivered to the decoder to drive the inverse operations of block rotation and flipping. However, because of the high level of spatial redundancy, this inverse operation can be efficiently predicted by analyzing nearby blocks. Only the prediction error is therefore coded and sent as side information. Experimental results have shown that for many image classes the entropy of the prediction error is fairly small in comparison with the bit saving stemming from the reduced size of the vectors and of the reconstruction look-up table.",

The proposed procedure can be used to obtain real world object representations starting from real views instead of manually build them by means of solid modeling and painting systems. As shown by the reported experiments, the results are promising, of course in all cases where the objects can be accurately reconstructed from the occluding contours technique, i.e. when the concavities, if present, are visible in the projected object silhouettes.",

      "abstract": "Signal sample quantization represents the basic operation of any system for digital signal processing and can be mathematically formalized as a least-distance application from the domain of input samples to a finite and fixed set of reproduction values generally called quantization levels, in case of scalar quantization, or reconstruction codewords in case of vector quantization. As the size of the reproduction set increases, the computational overhead introduced by the least-distance search procedure leads to a drastic reduction of the system performances. A fast and efficient implementation of the search algorithm represents a problem of key relevance, expecially as far as high dimensional vector quantization is concerned. The algorithm presented in this paper employs a binary tree structure to address the reconstruction set according to the least-distance rule, providing a logarithmic reduction of the search complexity. The addressing tree structure is shaped depending on the input signal statistics in order to minimize the average search time. Experimental results show interesting possibilities of application in case of low-dimensional vector spaces.",

      "abstract": "An innovative algorithm is presented for the design and implementation of a self‐adaptive vector quantizer for videophone coding. The codebook is organized in a binary tree structure capable to modify its topology and content in order to adaptively track the input varying statistics. The resulting tree structure is unbalanced, in the sense that some branches are extended more than others, depending on the input vector distribution, and therefore the suboptimality of tree structured VQ with respect to the full‐search approach is greatly reduced. As it is known a priori that the class of input video data consists of a human head slowly moving against a static background, knowledge based segmentation of incoming frames can be efficiently performed. Exhaustive simulations have shown the effectiveness of the algorithm in standard CIF videophone sequences. Some procedures have been parallelized and implemented on a AT&T Pixel Machine for frame‐rate coding. Results and comments on both the algorithm and the parallel implementation are presented.

      "abstract": "In this paper an innovative knowledge-based scheme is presented for videophone sequence coding, yielding an average bitrate of few hundreds of bit/sec. with a reasonable subjective reconstruction quality. Videophone images are segmented and approximated by means of a suitably adapted 3D wire-frame model capable to faithfully reproduce the signal temporal evolution through a limited number of updating parameters extracted from the real sequence. Muscle modeling represents the basic issue for the analysis of facial expressions at the encoder and for their synthesis at the decoder. Facial muscles are modeled either as linear fibers or as circular fibers and are characterized by descriptive parameters such as thickness, length, position and direction. Animation is performed by simulating muscle contraction and relaxation over the domain of influence defined by the muscle parameters. The interactive procedure for the construction and adaptation of the 3D model and the analysis/synthesis algorithms, implemented on a multiprocessor AT&T Pixel Machine, are described, together with some examples of the achieved experimental results.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a method for the adaptive quantization of the motion field obtained from multiple reference frames. The motion estimation is obtained through a block-matching technique, with the assumptions of pure translational motion and uniform motion within a block. The regular assumption of constant intensity along the motion trajectory in the spatio- temporal path is relaxed. On one hand, this allows for illumination changes between the reference frames and the frame to be motion-compensated. On the other hand, it allows for additional freedom to reduce the prediction error after motion-compensation when the translational and rigid body motion assumptions are violated. The matching function represents the difference for each block of the luminance signal in the frame to be encoded with respect to a linear combination of 2 displaced blocks of same size in the reference frames. The adaptive quantization mechanism is based on evaluating, on a block basis, the local sensitivity of the displaced frame difference signal to a quantization of the motion field parameters. It is shown how such sensitivity depends only on the reference frame signals, which allows to keep it below a desired threshold without additional information to be sent to a receiver. Simulations are carried out on standard CIF (240 × 360) source material provided to the ISO/MPEG. Results are discussed to show the improvement with respect to the strategy suggested in the draft recommendation of the ISO MPEG for interactive video at 1.5 Mbps.",

      "abstract": "In this paper a coding technique is presented which extends the methodology of vector quantization to image sequence coding. The devised algorithm basically consists of a processing stage encharged to build up the initial codebook and a codebook updating mechanism running on-line with the coding phase, to adaptively track the varying statistics of the incoming images. The codebook is organized in a binary tree structure where each leaf represents a reproduction vector. The tree grows intrinsecally unbalanced in the sense that each node splits or not according to the intensity statistics of the vector population which refers to it. By doing so, the suboptimality of tree structured vector quantization with respect to full search approaches is successfully overcome. During the coding phase the unbalanced tree is left free to plastically track the temporal variations of the incoming data statistics. This results either in some reproduction vectors to be replaced by new ones, or in some changes in the tree topology to be carried out, typically a leaf which needs to split or two leaves which, conversely, shall be cut off. An updating code stream is periodically delivered onto the channel, interlaced with coding data, to replenish the reconstruction codebook. Application to videotelephone sequences has given promising preliminary results which are presented and discussed.",

      "abstract": "An innovative algorithm is presented for the automatic detection of spot targets in infrared terrain image sequences. The algorithm is designed to successfully perform target detection also in presence of deceitful hot background structures, such as rocks and sand representing the hottest regions of the scene. The original contribution is represented by the thermal model adopted for the infrared scene and which drives the intraframe processing by iteratively applying three processing steps: i) thresholding ii) clustering iii) semantic labeling. The aim of the intraframe segmentation module is first to detect well contrasted targets and then verify the presence of less contrasted ones on the hypothesis that they all belong to the same formation. At each iteration, within the intraframe analysis, the thermal threshold is lowered and the hot part of the scene is processed to look for the presence of targets. By means of different clustering procedures the hot part of the scene is partitioned into a set of connected objects, each characterized by a feature vector consisting of area, peak thermal value and centroid coordinates. The objects which correspond to the target model are marked as potential targets. If they have been already detected during the previous iterations without sensible changes in the descriptive parameters, they are labeled as 'confirmed' targets. If, on the contrary, the area has significantly increased, they are labeled as 'expanded' targets. If a previously detected target is no more recognized within the current iteration, it is labeled as 'disappeared'. When the number of disappeared and expanded targets exceeds a given value, function of the number of the targets so far detected, the iteration is stopped. The performances of the method, applied to a synthetic sequence, are finally presented.",

      "abstract": "A real time segmentation algorithm for infrared sequences is presented, based on the iterative application of thermal histogram processing and thresholding. The segmentation algorithm is intrinsecally not sequential and may therefore be decomposed into a graph of concurrent processing tasks well suited to a parallel implementation. The algorithm is based on the assumption that two pixel populations are present, namely object and background. Since in this hypothesis the separation goodness function should have one single maximum, the algorithm forces this behaviour by redistributing the area of the histogram, i.e. by progressively brightening the target population. An initialization phase finds out potential target areas throughout the current frame in cooperation with a temporal tracking and labeling task, and compiles the search windows set. For each search window the thermal histogram is computed. Then a family of modified histograms is obtained by removing greater and greater areas from the hot tail of the original histogram and by replacing it with an impulse of the same area at the highest extreme of the thermal range. Each of these histograms enters a module which computes a separation goodness function. The separation function presents two adjacent segments: the high thermal segment and the low thermal segment. The former is a constant segment which lasts from the high extreme of the thermal segment. The former is a constant segment which lasts from the high extreme of the thermal range down to the lowest thermal value of the removed area, the latter has a variable shape and lasts as far as the lowest extreme of thermal range. The iteration is stopped as soon as the variable segment reaches a monotonically decreasing behaviour. The boundary value between the two segments is chosen as threshold within that window. Experimental results are presented.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents and compares different Vector Quantization techniques for image coding. First, the Linde-Buzo-Gray (LBG) technique is considered, whoise effectivness is known in achieving a minimum distortion partition of the training vector hyperspace: the convergency of the seed points toward the centroids of a stable configuration is discussed. Two other approaches are then examined: the first one based on Cohonen neural networks, the second one based on a tree structure to reduce the computational burden during the codebook construction and the actual coding. Performance evaluation is made in terms of bitrate and reconstruction distortion. Experimental results and performance curves are also reported concerning application to static image coding.",

      "abstract": "In this paper a code-bit allocation policy is presented for the vector quantization of video data, based on the Human Visual System (HVS) frequency response. Discret Cosine Transform is employed for data decorrelation and a frame adaptive vector quantization mechanism is subsequently applied for the DCT coefficients encoding. HVS response is taken into account for the code-bit allocation by sizing the reconstruction look-up table of each vector quantizer. Before vector quantization, DCT coefficients are zig-zag reordered and thresholded; the quantized coefficients are subsequently run-length encoded. The resulting coder presents the basic characteristics of being block-oriented, layered and variable bitrate (VBR): promising results in applications within packet switched networks are forseen. Preliminary results are presented.",
