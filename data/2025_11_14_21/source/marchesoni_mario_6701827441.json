This paper presents a detailed analysis of the efficiency, power loss, and THD characteristics of multiplexed multilevel converters and neutral point clamped converters. Using MATLAB<sup>®</sup>Simulink 2024b, the switching and conduction losses of both multiplexed multilevel converters and NPC converters are calculated. The three-level NPC converter offers advantages of a simpler design, reduced component count, and cost effectiveness with the drawback of low voltage quality. Simulation results validate the THD, power losses, and efficiency for the conventional three-phase three-level NPC converter and the three-phase multiplexed multilevel converter, and a detailed comparison is performed.",

      "abstract": "A direct torque control (DTC) algorithm with synchronous modulation for high-power induction motors is presented in this paper. While maintaining the dynamic response and robustness of a PI-based DTC operating in the stationary reference frame, the proposed scheme is able to keep an integer PWM modulation ratio, adjusting the stator flux angle and the switching period at each control step so that the synchronicity condition is always satisfied. In this way, it is possible to achieve an improvement of the very low-frequency harmonic spectrum of the torque, in particular by reducing torque sub-harmonics. These represent one of the main problems associated with low-frequency modulation typical of high-power drives and their reduction allows to avoid drawbacks such as resonance and mechanical stresses. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated with experimental tests on a small-scale test bench.",

      "abstract": "A medium voltage induction motor drive for a submarine oil pump is considered in this paper. In the considered application, the inverter is located on the oil platform, whereas the submersible oil pump is located under the sea and it is supplied with a 20-km long cable. Moreover, an LC filter is located at the inverter output on the platform. In addition, since all the motor sensors should be maintained with submarine robots, stator voltage, stator current and rotor speed sensors are not installed on the motor for reliability reasons. In this study, a new sensorless control is developed. The proposed control integrates a voltage drop compensation and a stator voltage-current estimation into a sensorless control based on a Luenberger Observer. The effectiveness of the proposed control is proved by experimental tests on a low voltage motor, on a 6.6 kV-710 kW motor and on a 2.1 MW-10.5 kV motor.",

The converter is designed to interface renewable energy sources and electric storages like supercapacitors or batteries, particularly in electric or hybrid vehicles and distributed generation systems. The proposed algorithm, first introduced in [1], calculates optimal duty cycles for the switches based on target conditions derived from reference values of source currents, achieving precise and fast response. Moreover, Discontinuous Conduction Mode (DCM) is exploited at low current levels, to increase efficiency. Experimental tests on a laboratory prototype demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness and robustness to parametric uncertainties, as well as its superiority over a traditional PI-based method in terms of dynamic response.",

      "abstract": "Fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) always incorporate a battery system to handle transient loads and recover braking energy. However, hybrid configurations, such as those integrating supercapacitor systems, are nowadays widely studied due to their potential to enhance efficiency, driving performance, and component lifespan. Supercapacitors offer significantly higher power density than batteries, making them valuable for FCEVs adoption. In this paper the use of battery and supercapacitors in a FCEV is investigated and the resulting energy consumption is compared under real road conditions. In addition, experimental tests have been carried out on Li-NMC battery cells and simulation tests have been conducted to validate the presented analysis.",

      "abstract": "A new topology of multi-input bidirectional DC-DC converters is proposed in this paper. The converter has a boost behavior, i.e., the output voltage is higher than the sum of the input voltages. This family of converters is particularly suited for hybrid energy storage systems, where different DC sources are connected together and where the output voltage is significantly higher than the voltage of a single storage. The proposed converter reduces the number of required switches, leading to higher efficiency and reduced complexity compared to traditional n-input converters. The new topology demonstrates superior performance by enabling higher efficiency with fewer components. A dedicated control, based on PI controllers, is provided to ensure stable operation under dynamic conditions. The effectiveness of the proposed solution is tested using experimental results on a four-input 20 A/100 V converter prototype.",

An H2-linear matrix inequality (LMI) framework has been adopted to expand the system stability region. The proposed approach differs from other stabilization methods proposed in literature by its ability to increase the power transfer through the converter while maintaining high control bandwidth and preserving the quality of input and output quantities. A Kalman filter has been introduced to estimate the full system state avoiding the installation of additional sensors. Furthermore, the method has a limited computational burden not requiring high performance control platform. Experimental tests compare the performance of the proposed strategy with a stabilization approach previously proposed in terms of stability performance and power quality.",

A new feed-forward current control for this DC–DC converter with three switches is presented in this paper. The modulation technique proposed in the literature for the aforementioned converter leads to a consistent loss reduction at low load, exploiting the DCM. As a drawback, when using this control strategy, the dynamic response worsens significantly. To speed up the control, a feed-forward approach is designed and implemented using a simplified converter electrical model.

As, however, the switching frequency decreases, problems arise, such as high current distortions and poor dynamic performance. Optimized pulse patterns (OPPs) can be employed to improve the current quality, but they need to be properly handled to achieve good transient response. This papers presents a gradient-based direct model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for PMSM drives that manipulates OPPs in real time such that superior steady-state performance and fast settling times are achieved.

The motor is usually connected to the inverter drive with a cable of tens of kilometres and sensorless control is a must since sensors can be replaced only with the use of submarine robots.

To overcome these issues, a new control is proposed in this study, involving a compensated sensorless FOC algorithm based on the Luenberger observer.

To optimize their design for high-voltage and high current operations, it is important to ensure their reliability, especially with regard to thermal aspects. In this article, simulations were performed to investigate the thermal resistance and transient thermal impedance of a diode with blocking voltage of 2800 V and a diameter of 46 mm copper pole by electrothermal modeling. Thermal parameters such as resistance and capacitance are calculated and an electrical equivalent circuit, the Cauer thermal network, is developed in PSIM. Furthermore, the Cauer model is transformed into a Foster model. Curve fitting method is used to extract thermal parameters from the thermal impedance curves through non-linear regression in MATLAB®. Using the derived resistance and time constants in Foster network, average current of a device may be predicted at different pulse durations and shapes. Moreover, experimental measurements were carried out to validate the thermal resistance for the investigated diode. Finally, a comparison with analytical curve also confirms the effectiveness of the approach.",

      "abstract": "In this article, a V/f control for high-power induction motor drives is analysed. In such uses, low dynamics in terms of speed-loop bandwidth is usually required. However, in some applications, where the load consists of a long shaft with certain mechanical components and with some resonant frequencies, instability and torque oscillations can cause significant damage. For these reasons, open-loop V/f control could be a winning solution, since it avoids resonances and oscillations caused by measurement feedbacks in the control. However, instability may arise also in open-loop V/f control. A stability analysis is here carried out analytically and a new method to overcome oscillations by varying dynamically the V/f ratio is proposed. The stability analysis and the effectiveness of the proposed method are verified with simulation results on a 2.8 kV-7.25 MW induction motor and with experimental tests on a small-scale 380 V-10 kW motor.",

      "abstract": "Battery storage systems are fundamental in UPS applications. UPSs are exploited when high reliability is required. A DC-DC converter is typically used to interface the battery to the inverter to match the different voltage levels. In normal operation, the battery of the UPS is not used and it intervenes only during grid blackout. However, the battery is subjected to deterioration and UPS intervention could fail. In medium and high power UPS, more battery modules are connected in series. If one battery is damaged, all the series is affected. To prevent this issue, a new double-input DC-DC converter is presented in this paper. The two DC sources can be controlled separately, resulting in a system reliability improvement. In addition, the damaged battery is not bypassed; hence the overall system performance can be maximized, since the deteriorated battery can provide energy at a limited rate. Additionally, the proposed converter allows batteries based on different technologies to be mixed together, achieving the best performances from each technology.",

      "abstract": "Voltage source converters are widely used in distributed generation (DG) and uninterruptible power supply (UPS) applications. This paper aims to find the controller that performs best when model changes occur in the system, showing insensitivity to parameter variations. A comparison of the finite control set model predictive controller (FCS-MPC), interconnection and damping assignment passivity-based controller (IDA-PBC), and passivity-based model predictive control (PB-MPC) reveals that the PB-MPC provides high resistance to these unexpected LC filter changes in the converter. The second aim of the paper is to reduce the total harmonic distortion (THD) of the output voltage of the three-phase voltage source inverter (VSI). A high total harmonic distortion (THD) value exists in the voltage waveform of the three-phase voltage source inverter (VSI), feeding a non-linear load. A MATLAB simulation was performed using three control techniques for a three-phase VSI feeding: linear load, unbalanced load, and non-linear load. The PB-MPC performs better than the FCS-MPC and IDA-PBC in terms of having a low THD value in the output voltage of the converter under all types of applied loads, improving the THD by up to 30%, and having low variation in THD with mismatched filter parameters, as shown in the bar charts in the results section. Overall, the PB-MPC controller improves the robustness under parameter mismatch and reduces the computational burden. PB-MPC reduces the THD value because it integrates power shaping and the injection of damping resistances into the VSI.",

      "abstract": "High-frequency signal injection sensorless algorithms are widely studied and used for rotor angle estimation in permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) at low speed or standstill. One of the main drawbacks of such methods is the acoustic noise connected to the voltage injection. In order to minimize this problem, it is advisable to increase the frequency of the injected signal. Thus, many studies focus on square-wave injection at the switching frequency, which is the maximum theoretical frequency. Since these methods exploit the rotor magnetic anisotropy, it is relatively easy to use them in interior PMSMs, where the rotor anisotropy is high. On the contrary, it is hard to exploit them in surface PMSMs, which have an almost symmetric rotor, although a low rotor magnetic anisotropy is still present. In this article, a sensorless algorithm with switching frequency square-wave injection is developed for surface PMSMs. To increase the signal-to-noise ratio, current oversampling is exploited. The benefits of such a technique are demonstrated with experimental results on a 2 N·m SPMSM.",

      "abstract": "Sensorless control of permanent magnet synchronous motors is nowadays used in many industrial, home and traction applications, as it allows the presence of a position sensor to be avoided with benefits for the cost and reliability of the drive. An estimation of the rotor position is required to perform the field-oriented control (FOC), which is the most common control scheme used for this type of motor. Many algorithms have been developed for this purpose, which use different techniques to derive the rotor angle from the stator voltages and currents. Among them, the so-called passive methods have gained increasing interest as they do not introduce additional losses and current distortion associated instead with algorithms based on the injection of high-frequency signals. The aim of this paper is to present a review of the main passive sensorless methods proposed in the technical literature over the last few years, analyzing their main features and principles of operation. An experimental comparison among the most promising passive sensorless algorithms is then reported, focusing on their performance in the low-speed operating region.",

      "abstract": "Sensorless algorithms for PMSM have achieved an increasing interest in the technical literature. They can be divided into active methods and passive methods. Active methods exploit rotor anisotropy by injecting high voltage frequency signals, whereas passive methods are based on observers. Even if passive methods do not have the drawbacks of active methods - acoustic noise, torque ripple and harmonic distortion - their effectiveness is reduced in the low speed region. For this reason, active methods are usually used at low speed and the motor control switches to passive methods in the high-speed region. Since high frequency injection is associated to many drawbacks, the aim of passive methods is to work at lower speed as possible or, ideally, to be able to start directly the motor. That is particularly true for Surface-Mounted PMSM: since they have a low anisotropy, high frequency injection should be particularly elevate to achieve sufficient signal-to-noise ratio. It is difficult to compare the performance of passive algorithms proposed in the technical literature since experimental tests have been done with different conditions: motors, inverter features, measurements, type of tests, etc. In this paper, five different sensorless passive algorithms for Surface-Mounted PMSM, selected among the most promising algorithms available in the technical literature, are compared, performing the same tests on the same experimental setup, to achieve a fair comparison and establishing the most performing one.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, part of the efforts of the electric drive researcher has been focused on the study of sensorless control algorithms that allow controlling the machine without a speed measure and with ever-fewer measurement devices. This article proposes a possible solution for the submarine application of an asynchronous motor. The motor is designed to drive a petrol pump at a depth of three thousand meters. The motor is fed by an inverter that is located on an offshore platform, and they are connected through a filter and a cable that is 19.74 km long. In this application, it is not suitable to use a speed measurement device; in fact, at this depth it is important to use as few components as possible, in order to increase the system reliability. A control algorithm that only needs available electrical measures is proposed below.",

      "abstract": "Asynchronous machines are always widely used in most industrial applications due to their reliability, flexibility, and manoeuvrability. To achieve variable speed operations, the quite simple open-loop V/Hz control is largely utilized. Under open-loop V/Hz control, the nonlinear interaction is well known to cause current and torque oscillations while operating at low to medium speeds under light loads. This article presents the stability analysis of induction motors at low–medium frequencies under no-load conditions with the V/Hz control. A system representation in the form of state space is discussed, and the region of instability is plotted against the V/f plane. Two novel and refined methods for the mitigation of oscillations in the region of instability are presented. The two proposed algorithms are finally tested and validated through simulation on an inverter-fed induction motor drive system.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, a double-input bidirectional DC-DC converter is taken into account. The converter allows to use less switches than a traditional solution and, moreover, it guarantees a higher efficiency. The modulation strategy proposed in the technical literature allows the converter to work in Discontinuous Conduction Mode at low-load and, therefore, to increase the efficiency in comparison to the CCM. However, such a control reduces the dynamics of the converter. To improve the transient response, a Feed-Forward approach is proposed in this paper. Since the converter model in DCM is complex and highly nonlinear, a simplified model is considered. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is proved with experimental results on a converter prototype.",

      "abstract": "The necessity to meet strict constraints on vessels emissions leads to a progressive adoption of innovative dc native energy sources. These sources are converter interfaced, and need to be integrated with the traditional power station. Two main converter control families are proposed in the literature: the grid-following and the grid-forming. This paper investigates the condition in which a converter interfaced unit, equipped alternatively with these type of control schemes, and a traditional diesel generator of comparable size, simultaneously contribute to the shipboard frequency and voltage regulation. A laboratory test bench has been developed to reproduce the shipboard power system, and to evaluate its regulating performances using either the grid-following or grid-forming strategy. The results are compared with a base case in which only the traditional diesel generator sustains the microgrid. The conclusions on the assessments of the different strategies are presented, considering the practical feasibility of such systems for actual seagoing shipboard microgrid.",

This method leads to some drawbacks, the main of which is acoustic noise. The frequency of the injected signal should therefore be increased to minimize this problem. A square-wave signal injection at the switching frequency is the subject of many studies, since this is the maximum theoretically achievable frequency. These methods are based on the exploitation of the rotor magnetic saliency and therefore they are widely used with interior PMSMs. On the contrary, the low anisotropy that characterizes surface PMSMs makes it difficult to obtain a good signal-to-noise ratio. A method that uses square-wave voltage injection at the switching frequency is proposed in this study for surface PMSMs. In particular, a new current oversampling method is developed, in order to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. Experimental results on a 2 Nm surface PMSM are showed, to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.",

      "abstract": "The use of series architecture nowadays is mainly on hybrid buses. In comparison with series-parallel and parallel architectures, which are usually exploited on medium-size cars, the series architecture allows achieving internal combustion engine higher efficiency. The downside of this architecture, due to a double energy conversion (i.e., mechanical energy converted in electrical energy and electrical energy converted again in mechanical energy), is that additional losses are introduced. For this reason, the parallel and the series/parallel architectures were considered more suitable for hybrid medium-size cars. Nevertheless, the use of new technologies can change this scenario. Regarding storage systems, supercapacitors achieved a significant energy density, and they guarantee much higher efficiency than battery storage. Moreover, the use of wide-bandgap components for power electronic converters, such as silicon carbide devices, assure lower losses. In this scenario, the series architecture can become competitive on medium-size cars. This paper shows a review of.",

      "abstract": "Sensorless algorithms for Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (PMSM) have achieved increasing interest in the technical literature over the last few years. They can be divided into active methods and passive methods: the first inject high‐frequency signals exploiting rotor anisotropy, whereas the second are based on observers. Recently, a sensorless control based on a rotor flux observer has been presented in the technical literature, which gives very accurate results in terms of rotor position estimation and robustness. In this paper, the aforementioned observer is considered and a procedure for choosing stabilizing gains of the observer is proposed. The contribution of the paper is three‐fold: the mathematical modelling of the rotor flux observer, the methodology for the definition of the observer gains, and the presentation of the experimental results.",

The modulation strategy proposed in the technical literature for controlling such a converter leads to a very low efficiency at low-load because the converter is only able to operate in continuous conduction mode when currents are low. A new modulation strategy, for exploiting discontinuous conduction mode, is here proposed. The efficiency increase is evaluated with a MATLAB/Simulink Plecs simulation model. The control algorithm and the simulation model are validated with experimental results carried out on a converter prototype.",

      "abstract": "Sensorless algorithms for Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (PMSMs) are widely studied in the technical literature. Active methods are based on high-frequency voltage injection, have the advantage of working in the low-speed region and at standstill, but they have some drawbacks such as acoustic noise, additional losses, and torque ripple. Passive methods, on the other hand, do not require the injection of additional signals, however, their performance deteriorates significantly in the low-speed region. Many observers are studied in the technical literature. However, it is difficult to perform a fair comparison among the proposed algorithms since the conditions in which the experimental tests are carried out are always different. Indeed, different studies perform different tests (i.e., with different speed and torque profiles) and with different test benches. The aim of this paper is to make a fair comparison between four different passive algorithms, selected among the most promising proposed in the technical literature. For all the algorithms same tests are performed using the same Surface PMSM test bench.",

Compared to the traditional DTC method, whose main drawback is the presence of low‐frequency torque harmonics (sub‐harmonics), in the proposed method, the PWM switching frequency is imposed to be an integer multiple of the main supply frequency. This is achieved by continuously adjusting the PWM switching period to significantly reduce low‐frequency harmon-ics. The devised algorithm has been tested on an inverter‐fed induction motor drive system, and the obtained results show an important reduction of the sub‐harmonic spectral content of the developed torque with respect to a conventional direct torque control while maintaining at the same time a high dynamic response.",

      "abstract": "Induction machines are always the most used machines in industry, due to the several advantages they offer. The quite simple V/Hz control strategy is one of the most commonly used strategies to control induction motors speed, due to its simplicity and ease of implementation. However, using this strategy for controlling high power induction motors may cause instability in some regions, leading to high oscillations in currents and in motor torque. Therefore, the authors propose an improved version of the V/Hz control strategy, which compensates for these oscillations by correcting the speed reference using the stator current. The results obtained are presented, showing excellent results in compensating for these oscillations in motor currents and torque.",

Nevertheless, SPMSMs offer high torque density, high efficiency simple manufacturing process and robustness which makes them an attractive alternative to Interior PMSMs. The Open End Winding (OEW) dual inverter topology, with one of the two Voltage Source Inverters (VSI) connected to a floating capacitor (FC), has shown to be capable of significantly increasing the operating speed range and CPSR of the SPMSM at the price of an increased controller complexity. In this paper, the analytical state space model of the OEW-FC SPMSM is derived, a state feedback controller is proposed and a possible tuning strategy is given to allow for high dynamics over the whole operating range and simplified controller design and tuning.",

On the one hand it allows to reduce the number of switches, on the other hand, it exhibits a higher efficiency in comparison to a traditional solution with two half-bridge converters in parallel connection. However, the control strategy proposed in the technical literature forces the converter to work in Continuous Conduction Mode at low-load, which leads to a low conversion efficiency. In this paper, a novel control, which exploits Discontinuous Conduction Mode, is presented. Efficiency increase is evaluated with a thermal model in MATLAB/Simulink Plecs environment and the control algorithm is then validated with experimental tests on a converter prototype.",

      "abstract": "Permanent magnet synchronous motor sensorless algorithms for low speed region are usually based on rotor anisotropy. Although many studies showed a good behavior of this type of control, high frequency voltage injection is required, which causes loud acoustic noise in addition to electrical losses. On the other hand, methods based on back electromotive force or rotor flux observer, which guarantee high performance in the medium–high speed region, do not required voltage injection. In this paper, a rotor flux observer based algorithm performance is analyzed, in order to extend its use also in the low speed region. Behavior both with no-load, linear torque, quadratic torque, constant torque and compressor-load torque is tested, especially focusing on motor starting. Improvements to rotor flux observer algorithms available in the scientific literature are discussed and their effectiveness is verified by experimental results.",

The model is then used to extrapolate the efficiency of a power unit with a diesel engine combined with a turbocompound system. The obtained efficiency map is used to evaluate the fuel economy of a supercapacitor-based series hybrid vehicle equipped with the turbocompound power unit. The turbocompound model, in accordance with the studies available in the technical literature, shows that the advantages (in terms of efficiency increase) are significant at high loads. For this reason, turbocompound introduction allows a significant efficiency improvement in a series hybrid vehicle, where the engine always works at high-load. The fuel economy of the proposed vehicle is compared with other hybrid and conventional vehicle configurations.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, an accurate efficiency evaluation of an innovative three-switch double input DC-DC converter for hybrid vehicle applications was carried out. The converter was used to interface two storages, (e.g., supercapacitor and battery) to the DC link. A refined model was created in MATLAB/Simulink Plecs environment and it was used to compare the traditional four-switch converter (i.e., two DC-DC converters in parallel connection) with the innovative three-switch converter. Loss and efficiency contour maps were obtained for both converters and a comparison between them was performed. A prototype of the three-switch converter was realized and used to validate the simulation thermal model by comparing both efficiency and current waveforms obtained with simulations and experimental tests.",

      "abstract": "One of the most important innovation expectation in railway electrical equipment is the replacement of the on-board transformer with a high power converter. Since the transformer operates at line-frequency (i.e., 50 Hz or 16 2/3 Hz), it represents a critical component from weight point of view and, moreover, it is characterized by quite poor efficiency. High power converters for this application are characterized by a medium frequency inductive coupling and are commonly referred as Power Electronic Transformers (PET), Medium Frequency Topologies or Solid-State Transformers (SST). Many studies were carried out and various prototypes were realized until now, however, the realization of such a system has some difficulties, mainly related to the high input voltage (i.e., 25 kV for 50 Hz lines and 15 kV for 16 2/3 Hz lines) and the limited performance of available power electronic switches. The aim of this study is to present a survey on the main solutions proposed in the technical literature and, analyzing pros and cons of these studies, to introduce new possible circuit topologies for this application.",

As a matter of fact, the tendency in this sector is to design parallel architectures in that they have provided until now a higher overall powertrain efficiency. However, technological improvements in many electric components and their increased efficiency can reshape this vision and give new outlines on HEV structure design. This paper aims to show the potentials of the series architecture, thanks to the latest electrical improvements especially in storage systems and power electronics. In particular, simulation models and fuel consumption data over different road missions are presented for the series architecture proposed in this study. In addition, a comparison between these results and data available in the scientific literature for state-of-the-art HEVs is reported.",

      "abstract": "Still today the dynamic identification of mechatronic systems - in particular electrical machines - is often based on stimulating them with deterministic signals, being single sinusoidal tones, single steps or periodical pulse trains of fixed frequency the most common ones. Such methodologies were the most, when not the only, practicable ones when the instrumentation was limited to low frequency generators and analog oscilloscopes, at most. The modern metrological scenario allows to concretize way more sophisticated approaches nowadays, which can bring to Mechatronics more holistic and easily executable identification methods; like those based on flat noise sources traditionally used in Radio Frequency (RF). More in general, the adoption of SiC and GaN fully controllable switches demands that also Power Electronics become eventually permeated with the very different way of thinking peculiar of RF. Within the framework of such cultural and methodological evolution that Power Electronics must embrace, the paper describes the unconventional use of converters based on GaN switches as powerful high-flatness noise sources for broadband dynamic identification, here tailored for modern electrical machines and battery technologies. Indeed, owing to the much shorter raise and fall times, as well as much higher switching frequencies enabled by GaN, it is possible to greatly extend the upper boundaries of the frequency bands where desired spectra can be synthesized by commutating such fully controllable switches according to proper time-based patterns. The authors illustrate the use of a randomly PWM-modulated H-bridge employing GaN E-HEMTs as high-flatness noise source up to at least 200 kHz thanks to 1 MHz PWM carrier. Various selected experimental results from identifications of BLDC Motors and Lithium-Iron-Phosphate (LiFePo<inf>4</inf>) cells are shown. The details in the figures are fully visible by magnifying the electronic version of the paper, which represents the same approach when Microfilms were widely used.",

      "abstract": "A self-commissioning sensorless algorithm for surface mounted permanent magnet synchronous motors is shown in this paper. The sensorless method is based on rotor flux observer and, differently from methods based on motor anisotropy, it does not require high frequency voltage injection; therefore, it does not cause additional losses and acoustic noise. The aim of this paper is to evaluate sensorless behavior in the low speed region, where performance of methods without high frequency voltage injection generally worsen. In particular, motor starting with rated torque at standstill and with intermittent torque is analyzed. Regarding self-commissioning algorithm, the estimation of motor parameters becomes crucial if this algorithm is used together with sensorless control, since the estimated values not only are used to realize the motion control (e.g., field oriented control) but also to estimate rotor position. Sensorless algorithm sensitiveness to motor parameter uncertainties is investigated. Experimental results are shown, using four different motors of various sizing.",

      "abstract": "The increasing interest in Hybrid Electric Vehicles led to the study of new powertrain structures. In particular, it was demonstrated in the technical literature how series architecture can be more efficient, compared to parallel one, if supercapacitors are used as storage system. Since supercapacitors are characterized by high efficiency and high power density, but have low specific energy, storage sizing is a critical point with this technology. In this study, a detailed analysis on the effect of supercapacitor storage sizing on series architecture was carried out. In particular, in series architecture, supercapacitor storage sizing influences both engine number of starts and the energy that can be stored during regenerative braking. The first aspect affects the comfort, whereas the second aspect directly influences powertrain efficiency. Vehicle model and Energy Management System were studied and simulations were carried out for different storage energy, in order to define the optimal sizing.",

In these high-voltage, high-power application fields, a high efficiency is mandatory. In this regard, an interesting and promising development opportunity could be to make soft-switching the elementary converters of the submodules (cells), half H-bridges or full H-bridges, obtaining at the same time the advantage of increasing the switching frequency. The-Active Resonant Commutated Pole Converter (ARCP) or the Auxiliary Quasi Resonant DC-link Inverter (AQRDCL) soft-switching topologies appear adequate for this purpose.

      "abstract": "Operation of a distribution grid under normal conditions and during a grid fault have contradictory requirements. In the first case, a meshed grid is preferable since it permits load balancing between adjacent lines and leads to better voltage profiles. However, a radial structure is preferable in case of a grid fault such as short-circuit, since it requires simpler protection schemes for fast and effective fault isolation. These issues become more vital with the increasing penetration of distributed energy generation. A soft open point is a power electronic device, generally consisting of two back-to-back mounted voltage source inverters that allows combining the advantages of both grid topologies described above. The soft open point can control both active and reactive power flow between two feeders permitting load balancing and reactive power compensation. In case of a grid fault, the soft open point limits fault current contribution of neighboring feeders. The soft open point is extendable to a soft open point with energy storage, permitting to mitigate transients of nearby distributed energy generation. A soft open point with energy storage is a powerful tool for the distribution system operator. This paper describes the design and simulation of a global control strategy of a low voltage soft open point with energy storage prototype. The simulation was set up to realize the prototype in a second step. The simulation and the prototype will allow to gather practical experience with this innovative device and to develop upper system level control strategies. In this paper the design, simulation and preliminary test results of the small-scale prototype of soft open point with energy storage system will be presented.",

      "abstract": "A distorted grid voltage or nonlinear behavior in the current control loop can cause low frequency current harmonics in a grid-connected voltage source inverter (VSI). Many efforts have been made to mitigate such phenomena, including hardware and/or control structure improvements. A well-known suitable strategy to reduce current harmonics in a selective manner is to apply a Proportional Multi-Resonant (PMR) current controller. Inverter-grid stability is another common issue when dealing with grid-connected VSI. Stability is influenced by the inverter impedance, which depends on the controller parameters. This paper presents a simplified tuning strategy for the PMR controller, taking into consideration the inverter-grid stability issue. The obtained controller was implemented and tested in a 10 kW three-phase inverter with a passively damped LCL filter. A significant reduction of current harmonics emission from the inverter up to 650 Hz was achieved without any hardware modification. The limits of PMR controllers to mitigate current harmonics were studied, and the influence of the grid impedance was verified.",

To achieve higher system control reliability and multi-functionality, the proposed architecture has been built with an effective split of the control tasks between a master controller and six slave controllers, one for each of the six arms of the converter. The MMC prototype has been used for testing both converter and system-level controls in a reduced-scale laboratory set up of a Multi-Terminal DC transmission network (MTDC). The whole control has been tested to validate the proposed control strategies. The tests performed at system level allowed exploration of the advantages of using an MMC in a MTDC system.",

In particular, CVT powertrains can count the highest number of sales in the HEV industry. In spite of this fact, in depth electrical losses analysis of this configuration and the introduction of more efficient electric component question the adoption of this powertrain as the model of energy efficiency. This paper aims to summarize the main results available in the scientific literature on this topic. It is firstly shown a fuel consumption comparison between the two parallel powertrains, secondly a brief description of the main electric component innovations is reported in order to fully understand the effects they have on the series architectures. Lastly, a fuel consumption comparison between the most efficient parallel solution and the series architecture is shown for the purpose of identifying the most efficient powertrain architecture.",

      "abstract": "Hybrid vehicles have experienced a great boom in recent years thanks to the increasing spread of 'parallel' architectures, often realized by a planetary gear train (Hybrid Synergy Drive). At the same time, an enhancement of electrical and electronic components has been experienced; these improvements especially concern reliability and efficiency. Particularly, the possibility of using supercapacitors with increasing storage performances makes possible to manage higher power flows together with a superior efficiency. These innovations may challenge the architecture used nowadays on medium size cars. The hybrid series architecture, which allows the optimal management of the combustion engine, has been disadvantaged until now by the electric powertrain efficiency. In the current scenario, this architecture could benefit from the above-mentioned technology, becoming a competitive alternative to the actual powertrain configurations. The aim of this article is the efficiency analysis, in order to evaluate the operational energy efficiency achievable thanks to this configuration. This analysis will be carried out considering all the possible working conditions of the different powertrains.",

      "abstract": "The AC/AC single-phase/single-phase Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC) presents very interesting features for the realization of a Medium Frequency Power Electronic Transformer for traction applications, in AC-fed or multisystem railway rolling stock, like locomotives, Electric Multiple Units (EMU), high-speed units, and so on. Aiming to maximize the output frequency of the converter, i.e. the operating frequency of the medium frequency transformer (m.f.t.) and/or to maximize the conversion efficiency, in this paper a proposal is presented, exploiting the opportunities offered by known soft-switching topologies. Simulation results fully validate this idea: In each MMC converter's submodule the H-bridge main semiconductor devices commutate in Zero-Voltage Switching (ZVS) conditions, with so much reduced losses that the switching frequency can be pushed-up toward unimaginable levels respect the classical hard-switching commutation, using usual silicon devices. More, the whole MMC converter operation remains substantially the same, because the soft-switching behaviour inside the single submodules does non disturb the operation of the overall MMC. The negative aspect is that the soft switching solution implies an appreciable increase in the overall amount of active and passive components, with obvious reflections on the reliability and costs issues. This article will discuss this theme with particular regard to the effects of simulation, loss assessment and power semiconductor sizing.",

      "abstract": "The growing development of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) has seen the spread of architectures with transmission based on planetary gear train, realized thanks to two electric machines. This architecture, by continuously regulating the transmission ratio, allows the internal combustion engine (ICE) to work in optimal conditions. On the one hand, the average ICE efficiency is increased thanks to better loading situations, while, on the other hand, electrical losses are introduced due to the power circulation between the two electrical machines mentioned above. The aim of this study is then to accurately evaluate electrical losses and the average ICE efficiency in various operating conditions and over different road missions. The models used in this study are presented for both the Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) architecture and the Discontinuously Variable Transmission (DVT) architecture. In addition, efficiency maps of the main components are shown. Finally, the simulation results are presented to point out strengths and weaknesses of the CVT architecture.",

      "abstract": "In recent years enormous growth has taken place in the hybrid vehicle sector; parallel architecture is the most widespread configuration regarding medium size cars. At the same time, storage systems and power electronics have experienced some important innovations. The development of supercapacitors has permitted management of high power with elevated efficiency. Moreover, the availability on the market of silicon carbide components has allowed a significant reduction of power electronic losses. These improvements may challenge the hybrid architecture used in medium size cars nowadays. On one hand, series architecture would relevantly benefit from an electric powertrain efficiency increase, on the other hand, these innovations would generate low benefits in parallel architectures. The aim of this paper is to evaluate electric component average efficiency over different road missions, in order to estimate fuel economy over various working conditions and finally to establish which hybrid configuration is most efficient in vehicle applications.",

      "abstract": "This paper investigates the feasibility of a sensorless field-oriented control combined with a finite-control set model predictive current control (FCS-MPC) for an interior permanent-magnet synchronous motor. The use of an FCS-MPC makes the implementation of most of the existing sensorless techniques difficult due to the lack of a modulator. The proposed sensorless algorithm exploits the saliency of the motor and the intrinsic higher current ripple of the FCS-MPC to extract position and speed information using a model-based approach. This method does not require the injection of additional voltage vectors or the periodic interruption of the control algorithm and consequently it has no impact on the performance of the current control. The proposed algorithm has been tested in simulation and validated on an experimental setup, showing promising results.",

      "abstract": "The process of modeling a qualitative evaluation schema to gauge the driver performance is a prominent aspect in enhancing the driving standards. We have implemented a comparative analysis module to estimate the driver performance based on absolute and social comparisons. In this approach we simulated a road network of 40 vehicle users and analyzed the performance of the users by our interlinked system architecture dedicated for simulation, data sharing and representation of the entire information on Map-based user interface. Another key aspect that was performed in this approach was the usage of Map-Matching module to discard the inaccuracies in Geo-references while representing the coordinates on Google Maps. We believe, this evaluation approach will broaden the overview of performance analysis and provide more insight to the user on all grounds in improvising the driving standards.",

The heuristic algorithm particle swarm optimization (PSO) has been used for the identification and optimization of parameters. Initially, a model-based identification procedure is performed to evaluate the parameters of the system. Then, the parameters of a proportional-integral-derivative (PID)-based controller are optimized by using a time-domain performance criterion. Experimental results, obtained by testing three different laboratory permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drive prototypes, are also presented to confirm the validity of the proposed approach.",

      "abstract": "A new modulation scheme, optimized for achieving a correct dc-link capacitor voltages balance in Diode-Clamped Multilevel inverters with Active Front End (AFE), beyond the limits found in the past, is presented. A detailed explanation of the new technique and how the optimization is achieved are presented. The results are completely general, analytically obtained and each result is verified using energetic considerations: the voltage variation of all capacitors due to the inverter must correspond to the energy drawn by the load and must be supplied by the AFE. The main results are shown and several simulation results in particular working conditions are presented in order to verify the general analytical computations. © 2012 IEEE.",

High frequency injection allows, by means of simple mathematical relationships, the estimation of motor characteristic inductances. The machine inductances are characterized by a certain degree of position dependent magnetic saliency, as a function of the shaft position, in particular the mutual inductance value, which is proportional to the error between the true angle and an estimated angle value. The angle error is utilized as error signal, in a phase locked loop technique, in order to track the motor position and speed.

      "abstract": "Nowadays, multilevel power converter structures are intensively studied and investigated for several applications, such as railway traction systems, active filtering, reactive power compensation and large induction or synchronous motor drives. However, only a few papers deal with the analysis of faults and the development of adequate remedial strategies. This is one of the most important aspects that must be carefully considered and investigated when transferring converter systems from research laboratories to the applications. Failures of the components in static energy conversion systems must be adequately faced to prevent severe and widespread damages in the converter, or even extended to the load and the grid. In particular, in multilevel converters, system protection is more difficult when compared to simpler two-levels converters, mainly because current fault paths can be much more complex. Problems may be exalted in high power applications, as those considered in this paper, when several kVs and hundreds of kAs characterize the application. In this paper, a study and an analysis of important fault scenarios in a high power (up to 12 MVAs) IGCT based Neutral Point Clamped converter system are presented and possible remedial strategies are discussed. Although the study has been performed mainly by simulation, some interesting experimental results, obtained in the joint laboratory between Ansaldo Sistemi Industriali and the University of Genova, are also presented. ©2008 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The reduction of the stator flux in an electrical machine moving at constant speed causes the reduction of the voltage at the machine terminals. In the field of electrical drives this phenomenon leads to the common convincement that the reduction of the reference stator flux, while leaving the speed unchanged, always avoids the saturation of the voltage source inverter connected to the machine, thereby preventing the potential loss of current control. Such a statement is correct only if any faithful model of the real interconnection network between the inverter and machine is characterized by ideal conductors directly connecting the inverter and machine terminals. Clearly, in the general case, the interconnection network is far from being faithfully modeled by ideal conductors. The present paper proves analytically that the nature of the interconnection network, together with a very common control strategy for the machine, can render the reduction of the reference stator flux below a certain value detrimental for the inverter, instead of beneficial. This is in contrast with the widespread convincement. The paper proves also that the interconnection network imposes an upper limit on the average power that can be exchanged between the inverter and the machine. The results are generalized for the case in which more inverters share the motor current equally and it is highlighted that both are simply two manifestations, just seen from different points of view, of the same intrinsic nature peculiar to the electrical circuit. ©2008 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "In high power ac motor drives, power semiconductor devices are allowed to switch at a quite low frequency, which is generally limited to a few hundreds hertz. Therefore, high torque harmonic components in the 0-1000 Hz frequency range often arise, which may compromise the processes accuracy and the products quality. The asynchronous Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) that is generally implemented in high performance control strategies further deteriorates the low frequency harmonic content. In this paper, a new induction motor control scheme is presented, starting from the theory of Direct Torque Control. Assuming the electromagnetic torque and the stator flux vector as controlled variables and the stator voltage vector and the instantaneous switching frequency as input quantities, it is possible to obtain a synchronous PWM while preserving the high dynamics response. The new theory has been tested by making a comparison with a more conventional DTC scheme. The obtained results show an improvement in the torque harmonic spectrum especially in the low frequency region. ©2008 IEEE.",

Using this solution, commercial equipment is able to supply medium-voltage motors by series connecting single-phase low-voltage H-bridge modules, delivering high quality waveforms. A three-phase diode rectifier, with a dc-link filter capacitor, generally feeds each H-bridge. Unfortunately, the capacitor must be bulky and expensive to compensate for the large low-frequency harmonic current component that is drawn by the single-phase load. Here, a new conversion structure is proposed, where well-known converter stages are combined in order to obtain a significant size and stress reduction of the dc-link capacitor.

      "abstract": "Modern fuel cell based electric vehicles should use energy storage devices such as batteries or supercapacitors to guarantee load leveling, assuring braking energy recovery and good performances in transient operations. To this end, converters with bi-directional power flows are needed to connect the accumulators to the dc-link of the motor drive system. In this paper, a new conversion structure for the bi-directional interfacing of two dc voltage sources with a higher voltage dc-link is presented, where only three controllable power electronic switches are needed and where the only limit is that the sum of the two dc voltages must be lower or equal than the motor drive dc-link voltage. The analysis of the converter structure, the control and modulation systems that have been developed and the obtained results are reported.",

      "abstract": "Electric Arc Furnaces are a major cause of line disturbance problems, in terms of flickers and of harmonic pollution. Various solutions had been proposed and applied, with the aim to compensate or control line disturbance phenomena. Optimal solutions can be found by using series and shunt devices, but system cost, reliability and efficiency become main issues. In the paper, authors propose a hybrid control and compensation system that allows an optimal tradeoff in performance and system cost, while providing high efficiency and reliability. The solution is a thyristor based series controller coupled with a high performance shunt compensator. The use of Phase Control Thyristor and the fast changing characteristics of furnace load impose the development of an open loop advanced control strategy based on a load estimator and on the prediction of instantaneous active and reactive power associated with partialized waveforms. Power associated with harmonics is also computed on line, in order to achieve better performances under extreme load conditions and in order to minimize the power required by the expensive shunt compensator. Concept effectiveness is shown by extensive computer simulations. © 2003 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The converter topologies identified as diode-clamped multilevel (DCM) or, equivalently, as multipoint clamped (MPC), are rarely used in industrial applications, owing to some serious drawbacks involving mainly the stacked bank of capacitors that constitutes their multilevel dc link. The balance of the capacitor voltages is not possible in all operating conditions when the MPC converter possesses a passive front end. On the other hand, in ac/dc/ac power conversion, the back-to-back connection of a multilevel rectifier with a multilevel inverter allows the balance of the dc-link capacitor voltages and, at the same time, it offers the power-factor-correction capability at the mains ac input. An effective balancing strategy suitable for MPC conversion systems with any number of dc-link capacitors is presented here. The strategy has been carefully studied to optimize the converter efficiency. The simulation results related to a high-power conversion system (up to 10 MW) characterized by four intermediate dc-link capacitors are shown.",

      "abstract": "A three-phase multilevel modular H-bridgc converter structure can be used to drive high power AC motors and has several advantages, if compared with the other most used multilevel converter structures. Often known as cascaded multilevel inverter, this simple but effective technical solution is being used by several manufacturers. However, even if a three-phase ac motor is driven, each H-bridge converter is single-phase and the de-link capacitance must be very large to reduce the dc-link voltage ripple. This paper shows how to reduce such capacitance and/or voltage ripple by using a new devised PWM strategy, performing also non conventional filtering actions on the dc-link. The main analysis has been based on the structure with simple C filter in the dc-link, but the developed method can be applied also to classical L-C dc-link filtering systems, thus permitting the avoidance of resonant conditions, extremely critical in these applications.

Within this scenario, a very interesting approach lies in the use of semiconductors with different voltage ratings and different switching characteristics. For this aim both GTOs and IGBTs could be employed, but a better technological solution surely lies in the use of IGBTs only, with different voltage ratings. Optimized multilevel converter structures, based on the Multi-Point-Clamped (MPC) concept or on the series connection of H-bridge inverter could then be developed, exploiting the possibilities arising from the use of different voltage levels. The authors have developed an optimal modulation strategy that uses the redundant switching configurations of the MPC converter structure to achieve an increment of the output voltage levels number. The novel approach, that is here proposed, permits a reduction of the harmonic content of the voltage/current waveforms and an interesting optimization of the switching stresses of the power semiconductor devices.",

In this paper a basis for the development of a generalized digital simulator platform is analysed. The main goal is to build a new methodology to develop a flexible, expansible, modular and user friendly software tool. To develop a so ambitious project new techniques and advanced programming instruments have been used. These tools must simplify the development of the software simulator and help the plant designer in the system definition. The user friendly is related to the plant and regulation description and to graphic output visualization. To use the simulation tools the designer must know well the plant simulated and the control system theory. For the developed simulator, the first test has been to project a processing line plant. All the machines used in the processing line have been modelled. In this paper, the methodology to design a processing line and the related power and control is described.",

However, they cannot operate at high switching frequency, thus producing waveforms affected by remarkable harmonic distortion, especially if conventional converter topologies are used. A novel ac/dc/ac conversion structure has been developed referring to single-phase ac (25 kV/50 Hz) traction systems; high voltage converters delivering multilevel voltage waveforms with lower harmonic content have been employed on both the line-side and the motor-side. High performance techniques have been studied to control the whole system, assuring a quasi-unitary power factor and a low distorted line current.

      "abstract": "An asynchronous motor can be controlled in many ways; however, it is well-known that, to obtain high performances, it is necessary to regulate flux and torque separately but at the same time. Decoupling can be achieved by using vector control techniques based on the principle of field orientation or on the so-called Direct Self Control (DSC). The different operating modalities of the above mentioned techniques are described and discussed, with particular regard to the DSC, and several results are reported and compared.",

Multilevel converter structures and high-performance control techniques have been developed to fulfill this goal in AC heavy traction drives. The tasks of the three-level rectifier are described in detail. The current control logic is particularly suitable for applications to multilevel bridges. Advantages deriving from the use of a medium-voltage converter with three different DC potentials are discussed. Digital simulation performed using the general-purpose electromagnetic transients program made it possible to verify the effectiveness of the regulating techniques on the whole system. By controlling converters suitably, the reactive power flowing was reduced to quasi-zero values having a constant voltage on the DC-link and minimizing the harmonic content of the line current in every load conditions. Another regulation technique was studied to balance the voltage on condensers which, acting exclusively on the rectifier and not using dissipating techniques or raising the device switching frequency, manage to keep the unbalance DV within a prefixed band design and the results obtained by digital simulations are presented and discussed.",
