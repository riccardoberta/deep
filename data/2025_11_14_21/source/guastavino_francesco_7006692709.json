      "abstract": "Electrical insulation is a critical component in electrical machines. The performance of the insulation system can be adversely affected by operating conditions that induce aging. Assessing the impact of environmental stresses is essential for predicting the failure of electrical insulation. Predicting maintenance to prevent service interruptions caused by insulation breakdown is a key objective. For type I insulating systems used in low-voltage and low-power rotating electrical machines, it has been demonstrated that partial discharges (PDs) are a contributing factor to electrical insulation breakdown. In fact, these insulating systems are not able to withstand the action of PD activity. The inception and evolution of PD activity is an indication of the poor conditions of the electrical insulating system, and this activity can be produced by the electronic power supply. The progressive reduction in partial discharge inception voltage (PDIV) is attributed to the deterioration of insulation properties induced by operational stresses. This study aims to evaluate and compare the effects of thermal stress on various types of enameled wires by collecting the PDIV values over time. In this paper, the authors analyze some particular effects of thermal stress as an aging factor. During the tests, an electrical stress was applied, which acted as a conditioning stress rather than one capable of producing degradation phenomena, as it was not high enough to initiate PD activity. In this research study, twisted pairs prepared from copper wires were evaluated. These wires were coated with various types of enamel and belonged to the thermal class of 200 °C. The samples were subjected to thermal aging tests at different temperatures. An electrical conditioning stress was also applied during all the tests and pertained to the same voltage, amplitude and frequency. The PDIV value pertaining to each sample was regularly measured to monitor its evolution over time.",

      "abstract": "The insulating systems are one of the most important parts for the proper operation of the electrical devices and can be subject to deterioration due to several phenomena like partial discharges (PDs). Nowadays, due to the increasing presence of the power electronic devices, there is an interest in studies relevant to the PD activity not only in the presence of pure sinusoidal voltage waveforms but also when a dc component is added as a result of electronic ac/dc conversions or floating potential operations. This work is focused on aging tests on twisted pairs specimens applying pure ac or ac + dc waveforms. The test voltage waveforms are applied to twisted pairs specimens until the total breakdown, assumed as end life criterion, is reached defining the life curves both in ac and ac + dc cases. During the aging, PDs are acquired, and it is possible to compute derived quantities useful to define a predictive model of the residual specimen lifetime. For what it concerns the presence of an overlapped dc component, the obtained results suggest that, considering the conditions imposed in this study, no remarkable changes in the aging phenomena and in the measured PD activity are identified.",

      "abstract": "Partial discharges (PDs) are a major cause of electrical stress and insulation failure, but their presence is also a symptom of insulation problems. Online PDs measurement allows for continuous monitoring of the insulation system. An online PDs measurement system for air-insulated switchgear (AIS) is developed, based on transient earth voltage (TEV) sensors, and evaluated for morphological analysis of insulation defects. The evaluation is conducted comparing the developed system with a conventional PD measurement system based on the IEC 60270 standard. The aim of the proposed system is to facilitate its integration with minimal retrofitting and operational disruption assuring the possibility to identify and analyze the defects. A pilot system, employing an AIS, is designed and tested. The results from both the PDs measurement systems are presented and discussed. Furthermore, the impact of a high capacitive load connected to the switchgear is investigated, and the possible effects of a capacitive load due to an MV cable is considered by simulating the realistic cable geometry.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this work is to achieve effective features to enable machine learning algorithms to identify defects and incipient faults in the case of insulating systems used for high-voltage direct current (HVDC) applications. Partial discharge (PD) testing and analysis has become a key tool in all aspects of the design, commissioning, maintenance and monitoring of AC and DC insulating systems. In this study, PD measurements were conducted on a medium voltage (MV) cable segment with artificial defects. These measurements were performed under a negative HVDC power supply using various sensors, including a High Frequency Current Transformer (HFCT), a Rogowski Coil, and a VHF Antenna. The acquired signals were post-processed using the Normalized Auto-correlation Function (NACF). The 3D NACF space plots have been obtained by selecting the three larger dispersion components obtained by the comparison of the NACF of the acquired signals. The objective was to analyze the differences in the measured PD signal data obtained with the three different sensors using machine learning algorithms. This analysis provides insights into the effectiveness of the developed features and their potential when different kind of sensors are used for the detection of faults in case of HVDC applications.",

Electrical trees can be incepted by these transient effects characterized by frequency components of several kHz. Normally, a higher voltage frequency is associated with faster polymeric insulation materials degradation. To better investigate the relationship between applied voltage and frequency and the growth of the electrical trees, cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) samples obtained from a commercial HVdc cable have been tested in different conditions. The partial discharge (PD) activity was monitored along with the degradation of such samples. The results show that both voltage amplitude and frequency influence the tree shape and consequently the time to breakdown: the increase of the frequency does not lead to a faster degradation and to a faster breakdown of the sample.",

The insulation system is the most critical part of the design because the limited dimensions lead to the presence of high electrical stresses, furthermore the characteristics of the high voltage winding and of the high voltage pulses, result in a not uniform voltage distribution along the winding itself. The high electrical field concentrations require high performance insulating systems including enamels, filled polymers, loaded cast resins. The aim of this work is to implement a tool to be used during the manufacturing process to evaluate the quality of the insulating system as regards the expected lifetime.

      "abstract": "The electrical insulation is a crucial element in electrical machines. The performance of the insulation system can be affected by the operating conditions that cause ageing of the insulation. The evaluation of the effects of the environment stresses is a key in the prediction of the electrical insulation breakdown. Being capable of forecasting the maintenance avoiding the out of service due to insulation breakdown is certainly an objective. It is proven that partial discharges (PD) are one of the causes of electrical insulation breakdown. The evolution of PD is an indication of the condition of the electrical insulating system. The severe lowering of the Partial Discharge Inception Voltage (PDIV) value can be a signal of the approaching to the insulation total breakdown. The continuous lowering of the PDIV is due to the degradation of the insulation properties caused by the stresses applied during the operation time. The aim of this study is to evidence and compare the effects of thermal stress on different kind of enamelled wires analysing the PDIV because is one of the accelerating factors together with relative humidity and frequency of the applied voltage [1]-[7]. In this study, twisted pairs made with copper wires covered with different enamels and having thermal class 200°C were assessed. The samples were subjected to thermo-electrical aging tests at the same voltage amplitude and frequency while different temperatures have been applied. The PDIV relevant to the samples was measured regularly to monitor its evolution over time.",

For this purpose, international standards propose different kind of procedures, usually focusing on the ability to withstand higher stress than what would be the working conditions for a defined timeframe without failures [1]. This approach has an intrinsic limit when there is the need to study how insulating materials parts of the system are affected by combined stress, since it doesn't focus on the development of the ageing. Once on the field, HV rotating machines status is monitored using Online Partial Discharge (PD) recording, but this technique can be used also during evaluation phase of insulation system, giving the opportunity to compare the behavior of different materials combinations.",

      "abstract": "The electrical insulation of small power electrical machines is a critical element especially when they are powered by means of electronic power supplies using techniques such as PWM. Power supplies based upon pulsed voltage trains can introduce, under certain conditions, overvoltage and this overvoltage can produce the inception of partial discharge phenomena. Enameled wires, even in case of high insulating thermal classes, cannot resist for a long time to the erosive action of the partial discharges and therefore, inevitably, reaching the total discharge conditions. In addition, the erosion of the enamel causes a decrease of the inception voltage, aggravating the situation and quickly leading to the total breakdown. In this study enameled wires thermal class mathrm{W}- 240{circ}mathrm{C} have been considered. These wires have been used to prepare twisted-pair specimen following the IEC 60851-5 standard. They have been subjected to thermo-electric ageing using a sinusoidal test voltage waveform, varying its amplitude and frequency. The obtained results show that, during the degradation, the PDIV values continuously decrease following an inverse power law relationship. Furthermore, the obtained data evidence that the PDIV derivatives do not depend on the test voltage amplitudes and frequencies but rather seems to depend on the temperature.",

This paper proposes the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to investigate and analyze the aging process of enameled wires, thus predicting the life status of the insulation systems. The CNNs training does not require any kind of assumption of how the factors (e.g., voltage, frequency and temperature) contribute to the life model. The experiments confirm that the proposal obtains better estimations of the life status of twisted pair specimens concerning existing solutions, which are based on strong hypotheses about the life model dependency on the factors.",

      "abstract": "Among the several elements that are part of the electrical machines, insulation is certainly one of the most important. Consequently, the study of its behaviour in some stressful situations can be very important: a breakdown of the insulation can in fact determine the out-of-service of the device itself resulting in downtime, costly repairs or replacements. Among the reasons that often appear in the causes of aging of electrical insulation there are the Partial Discharges (PD), a phenomenon that over time tends to erode the dielectric causing the total breakdown. What makes this phenomenon even more dangerous is its evolution over time: due to the erosion of the material, the Partial Discharge Inception Voltage (PDIV) can undergo an involution and decrease continuously. It is known how an excessive lowering of this value can lead to the complete breakdown of the insulating material. However, the applied voltage is not the only element that can facilitate the inception of partial discharges: as shown in [1] the temperature can be an accelerator for the aging, as well as the frequency of the applied voltage [2]. In this study, twisted pairs made with a copper wire covered with a polyimide-based enamel and having thermal class W-240°C were examined. The samples thus made were subjected to thermo-electric aging tests at the same voltage amplitude and temperature level but with different test voltage frequencies: by doing this, lifetimes ranging from about 6 to 70 hours have been obtained. Their PDIV was measured over time in order to monitor its evolution. By calculating the PDIV values in correspondence with the total discharge, a lifetime curve was obtained as a function of the frequency of the applied sinusoidal voltage. The trend of this curve seems to have confirmed the experimentally obtained data.",

Moreover, to have a good control of the speed and torque of the electric motor, usually they are fed by power electronic drives that generates voltage waveforms with lots of harmonic distortion and fast rise and fall times such as PWM power supply. With sinusoidal voltage waveforms, the PD measure can give useful information about the defect of the device under test. It can be interesting to investigate if it is possible to analyze the PD pattern shape even when the voltage waveform power supply has fast rise and fall time fronts.

      "abstract": "During fault situations within high voltage direct current (HVDC) links, transient overvoltages with frequency components of several kHz, can occur and incept electrical trees inside the cable insulation. Since the relationship between applied voltage and frequency and the growth of the electrical trees is not completely understood, a deeper investigation is necessary. In particular, starting from cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) samples obtained from a commercial HVDC cable, electrical treeing tests have been performed by applying a voltage level with two different frequencies: 50 Hz and 2.2 kHz. During the tests, the partial discharge (PD) activity has been monitored. The obtained results show that the time to breakdown obtained from the samples subjected to the 50 Hz power supply is shorter than those obtained with 2.2 kHz. Analyzing the PD activity and the sample by means of digital microscope, different tree shapes were visible, which influence the degradation time of the performed test. The obtained results of this preliminary study suggest that increasing the frequency does not necessarily lead to a reduction of the time to breakdown but influences the shape and the growth of the electrical trees.",

      "abstract": "Partial discharges are one of the main causes for what concerns the degradation of the electrical machines insulation system and their onset can bring the devices in question to their end of life precociously. In addition, although an electric machine does not show partial discharges when it is put into service, it is possible that this phenomenon develops over time due to the aging of the insulating material caused by the electrical stress to which it is subjected. However, depending on the application in which these machines are used, electrical aging may not be the only cause that leads to partial discharges. Some electrical machines with type I insulating system may in fact be used in more prohibitive applications that involve high temperatures, therefore in such cases a possible cause of the onset of partial discharges may be the thermal ageing. In this study, twisted pairs with thermal class W-240 °C composed of copper wires covered with a polyimide-based enamel were analyzed. Thermal ageing tests were carried out on several specimens at different temperatures in order to measure the trend of their Partial Discharge Inception Voltage (PDIV) over time. To prevent electrical ageing phenomena from modifying and influencing the results, the repeated PDIV measurements were made in a very short time. In the here considered case, the study demonstrated that at both test temperatures the specimens showed a rapid decrease in the PDIV values in the first 65 hours while subsequently there was a flatter trend. From the reported graphs it is clear how a higher temperature can lead to a more marked decrease of the PDIV values.",

      "abstract": "The conventional Partial Discharges (PDs) measurement systems, IEC60270 compliant, normally use a quadripole as coupling device to convert the current pulses to output voltage signals when the system bandwidth is in the frequency range from 40 kHz to 1 MHz. This kind of measurement usually needs an off-line measure and an invasive procedure to connect the objects under test to the measurement system. Other measurement systems based on non-invasive sensors like High Frequency Current Transformer (HFCT) and Transient Earth Voltage (TEV) could be used if the provided results give comparable response. Focusing on TEV sensors, they can be coupled to measurement systems having a frequency bandwidth out of the range defined in IEC60270 standard. The comparison among TEV measurement system and those IEC60270 compliant can be based on the derived and statistical quantities computed starting from the PD pattern. PD Patterns have been collected during electrical ageing test applied to twisted pair located in an air insulated medium voltage switchgear (AIMVS).",

      "abstract": "The online monitoring of a high voltage apparatus is a crucial aspect for a predictive maintenance program. Partial discharges (PDs) phenomena affect the insulation system of an electrical machine and—in the long term—can lead to a breakdown, with a consequent, significant economic loss; wind turbines provide an excellent example. Embedded solutions are therefore required to monitor the insulation status. The paper presents an online system that adopts unsupervised methodologies for assessing the condition of the monitored machine in real time. The monitoring process does not rely on any prior knowledge about the apparatus; nonetheless, the method can identify the relevant drifts in the machine status. In addition, the system is specifically designed to run on low-cost embedded devices.",

      "abstract": "The Partial Discharge phenomenon represents one of the major causes of the deterioration and ageing of the insulating systems of electric machines and, consequently, leads to a considerable shortening of their lifetime. Although the theory and practice focus more on partial discharges caused by a sinusoidal power supply, this study aims to analyze the possible consequences due to the presence of a DC component. This objective in fact has been taken into consideration due to the numerous and continuously increasing use of power electronics in the electrical systems: this can introduce a DC offset into the power supplies. A circuit capable of combining a high voltage AC supply with a high voltage DC one has been therefore designed and realized. Several specimens based on twisted pair wires have been subjected to the resulting voltage. During the degradation process the Partial Discharges activity has been monitored. The obtained results suggest that, in the here considered case, the presence of a DC component does not significantly affect the specimen lifetime and the activity of Partial Discharges.",

It is known that these machines are supplied by a PWM inverter and if there is a relative long distance between the machine and the power electronics, the resonance and the reflection phenomena could cause overvoltage in the power supply voltage. This overvoltage could incept partial discharge (PD) activity in the insulating systems. This kind of insulating system can't resist under PD activity and the machines quickly reach total breakdown conditions.In an insulating system composed by enamel and resin, it takes great importance the chemical compatibility between them and the adopted impregnation techniques. In this study, two kind of impregnating resin applied on twisted pairs with a conventional enamel, have been analyzed to compare the different behavior. Ageing tests have been performed until the specimen total breakdown, and the PD activity has been monitored. Analyzing the derived quantities of the PD activity, a predictive lifetime model has been obtained.",

      "abstract": "The development of automated tools capable of monitoring electric motors is important for industrial applications. The measure of partial discharges is one of the most prominent methodologies for the evaluation of electric motors operating conditions. This work proposes to apply tensor-based classification methods to discriminate between different partial discharges sources. The major advantage of tensor-based approaches relies on the fact that they can inherently handle partial discharges pattern using all the geometrical information embedded in the patterns. Secondly, noise filtering can be embedded in classification mechanism, without manual tuning. As a consequence, better performances are obtained in presence of additive sources of noise like 4G, GSM connections and electromagnetic sources that could be detected by conducted and irradiated sensors especially during an online monitoring. To demonstrate the ability of the tensor-based methods to overcome the noise presence, tests involved defects with different levels of addictive noises. Experimental results proved the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

The nanocomposite materials based on polyolefin matrices were prepared by extrusion and then molded into slabs from which it was possible to prepare apposite specimens to perform electrical treeing tests. The polymeric employed matrices are low density polyethylene (LDPE) and ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA). The considered fillers were commercial modified montmorillonite having a lamellar structure and unmodified silica presenting a spherical shape. The behavior of the different materials were compared and correlated with the material properties and structure. The treeing inception voltage (TIV) and the time to breakdown (TBD) as the final event of the electrical tree growth were considered. Furthermore, in order to identify the presence of defects inside the specimens due to the preparation process the partial discharge (PD) activity was monitored. The PD patterns were acquired by a phase resolved partial discharge analyzer (PRPDA).",

      "abstract": "The main insulating system components of stator windings of rotating electrical machines are organic enamel and impregnating resin. When power electronic converters supply motors, the stator insulation system is subjected to voltage waveforms such as PWM composed by trains of pulses. Due to reflection phenomena, overvoltage can be associated to pulsed waveforms and partial discharge (PD) activity can incepts leading to the insulating system failure in short time. In this work two types of conventional and nanofilled impregnating resins, based on unsaturated polyester and solvented alkydic resin matrices, have been compared. Suitable twisted pair samples prepared by means of wires insulated with conventional enamel and by two impregnating resins have been tested. The twisted pair samples have been subjected to sinusoidal voltage waveforms, having amplitudes slightly higher than the Partial Discharge Inception Voltage. Aging tests have been performed until the insulating system breakdown, which is assumed as end-point criterion: during the tests, the PD activity has been monitored by means of a PRPDA system. For each sample, starting from the PD signals post processing, the apparent current of positive discharges has been considered: this derived quantity showed a linear behavior with the degradation time. In order to define a life model, the slopes of the straight lines have been put in relation with the related lifetimes by means of the inverse power law.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this work is to analyze how the presence of combined AC-DC voltages can influence the partial discharge (PD) activity. A DC offset can be introduced by power electronics components affecting the partial discharge inception voltage (PDIV). If the PD phenomenon is the main cause of the electrical insulation degradation, the lifetime can be influenced by the presence of a DC component in the voltage waveform. In this work a simplified configuration has been considered in order to analyze the influence of the DC offset on the PD behavior. Twisted Pair samples have been taken into account representing surface PD activity conditions. The enameled wires have been subjected to PD activity after a conditioning in oven at 150 °C. The effect introduced by the DC continuous component offset is considerable. The number of discharges increases and the level of inception voltage decreases proportionally with the decrease of the continuous component, consequently the lifetime values vary since they are influenced by the PD activity. It has been possible to observe how the DC component influences the PD activity and the relevant degradation processes. This preliminary work suggests to perform exhaustive studies to better understand how the presence of a AC-DC voltage waveform can influence the PD behavior in case in different types of defects.",

      "abstract": "Ahstract-In order to recognize on-line different kind of defects where partial discharges take place it is necessary to employ an embedded acquisition system, possibly low-cost, near to the discharges site. Such acquisition system should be capable to analyze the acquired data in real time to recognize different defect sources. For this reason, a single hidden-layer feedforward neural network (SLFN) is presented in this work. Such neural network inherits the approach adopted by the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), but its activation functions are based on hardware friendly step (hard-limit) function. This facilitates the hardware resources optimization. In order to show the effectiveness of this solution different kind of PDs signals have been acquired. Once the data have been available, they have been divided in two sets: training and test. The training data have been used off-line to construct the model. Therefore the test data have been used on-line to perform the neural network. Moreover a comparison, in term of generalization error, between the classic ELM (based on complex activation functions, e.g. sigmoid), the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and the digital realization has been analyzed and showed. The results demonstrate how a simple algorithm as a single layer feedforward neural network is able to distinguish different kind of PDs using limited resources. Eventually the occupation area is shown on different low-cost devices varying the number of neurons in the hidden layer. The new ELM digital implementation is able to achieve good results, in term of generalization error when involved in supervised problems recognizing different kind of PD activity. These results are comparable to the ones obtainable by mean of standard ELM and SVM.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays the massive adoption of electronic converters to supply electrical motors leads to critical problems during the normal operation. In fact when the motors are supplied by electronic converters, the stator insulating system could be subjected to over voltages due to reflection and resonance phenomena. Frequently this over voltages exceed the partial discharge inception voltage and partial discharge activity incepts. The presence of partial discharge activity implies the degradation of the dielectric characteristics of the type I insulating system and in the short-medium time, leads to a total breakdown discharge. Three different types of type I insulating system used in rotating electrical machines fed from inverters have been considered and studied. The PDIV and RPDIV at different temperatures have been measured and compared. During this research study the stators of asyncronous motors have been subjected to sinusoidal waveform and unipolar positive voltage pulses at different temperatures. In order to perform the RPDIV measurements a modified surge tester has been used so to apply unipolar positive voltage pulses at the terminals of the windings. The correlation between the repetitive partial discharge inception voltage and the partial discharges inception voltage measured at different temperatures has been studied.",

Normally the PDs activity shows signals having different amplitudes (few high amplitudes PD signals with many low amplitudes). Avoiding the A/D converter saturation that lead to measurements information loss, it has been necessary to set the reference voltage on the expected maximum PD signal magnitude. Due to the presence of high amplitude PD signals in real cases it could be difficult recognize bad quantized PD signals (low amplitude) from the noise. In fact, the LSB (Least Significant Bit) of the noise results similar to the ones of PDs signal. In this study, the main issues relevant to this identification problem have been analyzed and discussed. The main purpose is to recognize PD signals from noise. PDs measurements have been performed maximizing the resolution of the maximum acquired discharge and, with the same resolution, noise measurements have been collected. This way the comparison among the noise and the PD signals have been performed. The applied method to distinguish the PD signal is the Equivalent Time - Equivalent Bandwidth (TW).

Considering the nature of this generation systems, remote controlled diagnostic solutions should be implemented. A predictive maintenance program based on partial discharges (PD) measurements on the power generator and electrical apparatuses installed in the nacelle could be useful. In fact partial discharge measurements permit to obtain information on the insulation systems conditions. Preferably, not invasive PD sensors should be installed for continuous on line PD activity monitoring. In this view, radiated PD signals could be detected by means of UHF antennas. The measurement could be affected by the noise coming from electronic devices and sources transmitting in the same frequency band useful for PD signals detection. Therefore, a noise map has to be well defined to evaluate the best PD signal receiver bandwidth. Preliminary in site test campaigns have been performed in order to characterize an ad hoc UHF antenna designed for PD detection. The noise in the bandwidth of the considered antenna has been measured locating the sensor in different positions inside the nacelle. The acquired signals during the measurement campaigns have been post processed and analyzed. The preliminary acquisitions permitted to determine the amplitude and the frequency range of the noise in the different sites. The frequency ranges with low level noise have been identified and the preamplifier bandwidth was set coherently. This allowed to achieve a high signal-noise ratio.",

      "abstract": "The stator motor windings of low voltage rotating electrical machines are usually insulated by organic enamel. When the motors are supplied by power electronic converters, the stator insulation system is subjected to different voltage waveforms such as PWM. Due to reflection phenomena, overvoltage can be associated to pulsed waveforms and partial discharge (PD) activity can incept leading to the insulating system failure in short time. In this work the PD evolution is monitored both for conventional and corona resistant enamels subjected to different voltage waveforms at different amplitudes. Suitable twisted pair specimens insulated by the considered enamels have been prepared and tested. Aging tests have been performed, monitoring the PD activity until the enamel breakdown, which is assumed as the end-point criterion. Pulsed and sinusoidal voltage waveforms have been applied having different amplitudes. In order to monitor the degradation phenomena, the partial discharge activity has been observed by means of a phase resolved partial discharge analyzer. In order to evidence the behavior of the considered enamels the obtained life curves have been compared; the trends of partial discharge activities have been evidenced and have been related with the degradation phenomena.",

      "abstract": "Composites reinforced with microparticles using a polymer matrix reinforced by nanoparticles represent a new emerging class of materials. Epoxy composites have been prepared using quartz as microfillers and organically modified Montmorillonite as nanofillers in order to study the dielectric properties of such new materials. The structure of the composites as determined by transmission electron microscopy, is neither exfoliated nor intercalated, although the thickness of C30B stacks is in the nanometric range. The influence of nano- and microparticles on epoxy matrix amorphous structure has been highlighted through Differential Scanning Calorimetry experiments. C30B has not effect on glass transition temperature but a drastic from 357 K to 325 K decrease is observed with the addition of microparticles. Heat capacity step remains unchanged, except for the microcomposite. And finally, Broadband Dielectric Spectroscopy has been used to characterize the dielectric properties at different temperatures. The spectra have been fitted with Havriliak-Negami equation to extract the relaxation times and the dielectric strengths associated with local β and γ relaxations and the main α relaxation.",

The tree inception voltage has been determined to evaluate both the effect of the filler and the good adhesion of the needle to the nanostructured sample material. During the tests, partial discharges have been acquired by means of a Phase Resolved Partial Discharge Analyser (PRPDA). The evolution of the parameters relevant to the partial discharges activity has been monitored in order to identify the tree growth morphology.

      "abstract": "The electronic switching converters used to supply squirrel cage motors can cause, during the normal operation, some critical problems leading to the early failure of the stator winding insulation. In fact if the electrical motors are supplied by switching electronic converters, the stator insulating system is subjected to voltage waveform having high frequency content (e.g. PWM); this kind of voltage waveforms can lead to an uneven distribution of potential along the windings and to the presence of overvoltages at the motor terminals. If these overvoltages have an amplitude higher than the partial discharges inception voltage, partial discharges activity incepts leading to the erosion of the organic enamel used to electrically insulate the wires of motor stator windings. During this research work the stators of the induction motors have been subjected to partial discharges measurements and electrical aging tests with the aim to find a possible relationship among the repetitive partial discharges inception voltage amplitude, the time to breakdown and the kind of motor insulation failure. In order to perform the electrical aging tests, a modified surge tester has been used: the tester applied unipolar positive voltage pulses at the terminal of the stator motor windings. The correlation between the repetitive partial discharge inception voltage measured before and after conditioning have been studied.",

      "abstract": "Early failures due to stator insulation breakdown are still frequently experienced in industrial applications where low-voltage induction motors are fed by adjustable speed drives. Such events are caused by the quick erosion of organic insulating materials used in Type I random wire wound windings when the inception of partial discharges (PDs) is triggered by the severe electrical stress produced by fast switching electronic converters. The present experimental work provides some interesting results about the medium-long-term behavior of nanostructured organic-inorganic enamel-based compounds in the presence of PDs.

      "abstract": "The adoption of switching electronic converters for squirrel cage motor drives can lead to some critical issues during the normal operation. The early failure of the stator winding insulation is one of the most investigated problems. The cost of motor failure is measured by interruption of plant output as well as extent of repair or replacement. The Surge Test is one of the most important tests for industrial electric motors, insofar as it allows the accurate checking of the machine functionality in order to identify any possible fault in the windings. Surge test is non-destructive and it has to be conducted at test voltage amplitudes so that they do not produce any winding damage and any significant insulation system degradation. This research presents the outcome of an experimental campaign in order to investigate the role of the voltage pulses on the degradation of the stator winding insulation of Type I electric motors: during the study the inter-turn, the groundwall and the phase-phase insulation systems have been taken into account. Electrical aging test have been performed using a surge test waveform at the terminals of the windings. Suitable electrical parameters have been monitored in order to identify the life end conditions. The amplitude of the applied voltage have been varied and the life time values have been collected and analysed. Furthermore the correlation between the repetitive partial discharge inception voltage and the life time has been investigated. © 2013 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays a lot of high voltage components are insulated by sulfur hexafluoride gas. This gas is unfortunately one of the main responsibles for the progressive increase of the global temperature: for this reason the sulfur hexafluoride gas should be substituted involving the need to find different gases or gas mixtures more environment-friendly. Furthermore it is well known that sulfur hexafluoride gas used as electrical insulator involves some problems: for example, if the temperature is very low, there is the possibility, due to its thermodynamics characteristics, to reach the dew point causing problems of condensation in some particular points inside the considered components. If this occurs, there is the possibility to have problems related to the excessive concentration of the electrical field. This research work is a part of a research activity focused on the dielectric characterization of gas mixtures in order to investigate the possibility to totally or partially substitute the sulfur hexafluoride gas with other cost-effective gas mixtures as electrical insulator for high voltage components and apparatuses. In order to characterize the here considered different gas mixtures, dielectric strength tests will be performed: the data collected from these tests will be duly analyzed and compared in order to identify the better gas mixtures from a breakdown voltage value point of view. © 2013 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The adoption of switching electronic converters for squirrel cage motor drives can lead to some critical issues during operation. Among the others, one of the most deeply investigated problems is the early failures of the stator winding insulation. When the motors are supplied by power electronic converters the stator insulation system is indeed subjected to some peculiar electrical stresses; the fast transients lead to an uneven distribution of potential along the windings and to the presence of over-voltages at the motor terminals when the connection cable between the converter and the machine is longer than few meters, usually ten or more. Since one of the parameters that has a major influence on such phenomena is the voltage rise time of the inverter output pulses, the stress for the insulation is enhanced by the adoption of ultra fast IGBT switching devices. The aim of this research activity is to realize a new high voltage pulse generator so that both the peak voltage of the generated pulses and their rise times can be varied in order to characterize Type I insulating systems of the electrical machines windings. © 2013 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The effect of different clay dispersion methods on the mechano-dynamical and electrical properties of epoxy/clay nanocomposites was investigated. Three different clay dispersion methods (high-speed mechanical shearing, ultrasonication (US), and an optimal combination of high-speed shearing and US) were used for the dispersion of the clay in the epoxy resin. 3 wt% of an organoclay, cloisite 30B, was used as the nanoclay. Wide-angle X-ray diffraction technique and electron microscopic techniques (SEM and TEM) were used to study the morphology of the nanocomposites. Dynamic mechanical analysis was used to study the dynamo-mechanical properties. Studies on the dielectric breakdown strength (EBD) of the nanocomposites show that the EBD strongly depends on the clay dispersion time and clay dispersion method. Pulsed electro-acoustics method measurement shows that the space charge accumulation was considerably reduced in the nanocomposites. In particular, reduction in space charges after polarization depends on the dispersion of the nanofillers, the better the degree of dispersion, the lower the space charges observed. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",

Pulse width modulator drives that are associated with these machines produce voltage waveforms having fast rise time fronts, and overvoltages at the winding terminals can develop because of resonance and reflections in the connecting cables. The overvoltages produced can become significantly higher than the partial discharge (PD) inception voltage (PDIV) of the magnet wire insulation so that PDs take place [2]-[13].

      "abstract": "The stator windings of electrical motors fed by means of inverter drives are subjected to switching voltages that constitute a heavy electrical stress for the winding insulation systems. Such stress together with the uneven distribution of potential along the windings and the possible presence of voltage peaks, due to resonance and reflection phenomena, often leads to premature failure of Type I winding insulation. In this study the electrical aging of enamelled insulating wires in presence of PDs has been investigated considering the applied voltage waveform as the core of the degradation processes together with the voltage amplitude. The experimental activity consisted in life test campaigns on twisted pair specimens. The specimens have been stressed applying five voltage waveforms until the total breakdown; some of the waveforms are designed in order to reproduce the output of a PWM drive. The times to breakdown relevant to different voltage amplitudes have been collected and lifetime plots for each voltage waveform have been computed and traced. It has been demonstrated that life time values are greatly affected by the particular shape of the test voltage. Furthermore, the obtainable life curves relevant to the pulsed waveform simulating the PWM drive conditions have to be traced by means of two straight lines having different slopes. © 2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The effect of amount of clay content on the thermomechanical and electrical properties of epoxy/organoclay nanocomposites is investigated in the present research. An organoclay, cloisite 30B (C30B), was dispersed in the epoxy resin and was cured with an amine curing agent. The morphology of the nanocomposite examined by X-ray diffraction shows exfoliation for nanocomposites with lesser clay content and intercalation for nanocomposites with higher clay content. The storage modulus (E′) of the nanocomposites increases monotonously with the increase in the amount of clay. The short time alternating current breakdown strength of the nanocomposites increases by the addition of C30B up to a certain clay content and then show a decrease. The space charge measured by pulsed electroacoustic method shows that the nanocomposite accumulate a very less amount of space charge and the charge decay in the nanocomposites are quicker than in the pure polymer. © 2011 Society of Plastics Engineers Copyright © 2011 Society of Plastics Engineers.",

      "abstract": "The electrical machines and in particular the electrical motors used in industrial applications are more and more often supplied by inverter drives, such as IGBT, so that the insulating organic materials of the inductor motor windings are subjected to voltage waveforms as PWM. In these conditions, degradation phenomena and in particular erosion due to partial discharges activity could take place, leading the insulating system to breakdown conditions. In this research work the partial discharges resistance of different insulating organic enamels has been studied: twisted pair specimens have been realized and then subjected to severe voltage waveform to simulate the real operating conditions that can take place when the electrical motors are supplied by inverter drives. The peak to peak voltage amplitude of the considered waveforms has been set always higher than the partial discharges inception voltage level in order to operate in presence of surface partial discharges activity. During the electrical tests, the specimens have been kept inside an oven at a fixed temperature level in order to study the combined effect of the thermal and electrical stress. The insulating enamel breakdown condition has been chosen as endpoint criterion: the obtained life time values have been collected and the relevant life curves plotted. Comparing the life curves it is possible to point out the different behavior of the analyzed organic materials when subjected to erosion effects due to partial discharges activity. © 2011 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Stator windings of low voltage electrical motors are usually insulated by means of organic enamels. If motors are used in particular industrial plants or in nuclear applications, the enamel adopted to insulate the motor stator windings may be exposed to very intense gamma photonic irradiation fields. In this research activity, attention has been focused on the potential influence of gamma irradiation dose on the performances of an electrical insulation system based on enameled wires having a thermosetting matrix. The aim of this research activity is to assess the prospects of exploitation of such insulating materials inside electromechanical devices intended to operate in presence of gamma photonic fields as in the frame of nuclear plant dismantling or, in general, of the manipulation of radioactive products. Suitable specimens, insulated by the considered enamel, have been set-up using enameled wire exposed to gamma photonic irradiation within a panoramic irradiator endowed with Co <sup>60</sup> gamma sources. These pre-aged specimens have been subjected to electrical aging tests up to the enamel breakdown condition, chosen as end-point criterion, in order to study the electrical performances of the considered wires. The peak to peak voltage amplitude of the considered waveform has been set higher than the partial discharges inception voltage level in order to work in presence of surface partial discharges activity. Enamel life curve has been plotted in order to point out gamma irradiation dose influence on the performances of the considered insulating material.

      "abstract": "Microcomposites are a well known class of materials. The enhancement of polymer matrix properties can be explained by the classical mixing law. But if the inclusion size is decreased to reach the nanometric range, the improvement of properties is no more due to mixing effect but to the influence of interface of nanoparticles on the matrix. A new emerging class of materials is composites reinforced with microparticles using a polymer matrix reinforced by nanoparticles. In order to study dielectric properties of such new materials, epoxy composites have been prepared using quartz as micro filler and organically modified Montmorillonite as nanofiller. Transmission Electron Microscopy has been used to determine the structure of the composites, which is neither exfoliated nor intercalated although the C30B stacks thickness is in the nanometric range. Differential Scanning Calorimetry experiments have been carried out to highlight the nano and microparticles effect on the epoxy matrix amorphous structure. The glass transition temperature is slightly affected by C30B addition but the microparticles inclusion produces a drastic decrease from 357K to 325K. The heat capacity step is rather unchanged except for the microcomposite. And finally, the dielectric properties of the materials have been studied by Broadband Dielectric Spectroscopy at different temperatures and frequencies. The relaxation times and the dielectric strengths associated with local β and γ relaxations and main relaxation have been studied. © 2011 IEEE.",

In this research work different insulating nanocomposite enamels have been analyzed: suitable twisted pair specimens insulated by the studied enamels have been prepared and tested. Breakdown voltage tests and electrical aging tests have been performed: during the electrical aging tests the specimens have been subjected to pulsed voltage waveforms having amplitude higher than the partial discharges inception voltage level in order to operate in presence of partial discharges.

The nanocomposites have been prepared by dispersing into the matrix 10% wt of nano fillers having different aspect ratio: sepiolite, montmorillonite and also sepiolite and montmorillonite together. Both considered nanofillers have been organically modified in order to obtain a homogeneous dispersion and to increase the chemical compatibility with the organic LDPE matrix so to enhance the interfacial interactions. Electrical tests have been performed applying sinusoidal voltage having a 50Hz frequency to a needle-plane electrode configuration in order to induce the formation of electrical treeing inside ad hoc specimens. The outcome evidences that the nanocomposites have a radically different performance in presence of electrical treeing. ©2010 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Low voltage stator windings of electrical machines are often realized by means of wires insulated by organic enamel. This kind of enamel can be subjected to partial discharges (PD) activity that could lead to breakdown condition the electrical insulating system so that the life time could be shorter than the expected one. In this research work, twisted pair specimens insulated by non corona resistant polyamide-imide enamel have been subjected to 50 Hz sinusoidal waveforms having different amplitudes. The electrical stress has been chosen so that in all the test conditions the applied voltage was higher than the partial discharge inception voltage (PDIV) value. In this way the surface aging has been inducted by the partial discharge activity. Aging tests have been carried out into an environmental chamber in order to control the relative humidity (RH) value so to analyze the effect of this parameter on the specimen life times; the total breakdown condition was chosen as end-point criterion and the relevant life time values have been recorded. The obtained results show that the PD activity is strongly influenced by the relative humidity levels and the change of its intensity considerably affects the time to breakdown values. Furthermore, the obtained data allowed to compute the life curves relevant to the different considered RH levels evidencing the relationship between the environmental conditions and the life time values. © 2009 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Partial Discharges (PDs) measurement deserves a specific study when in the presence of fast rising/falling voltages, as the output of IGBT switching devices. In such operating conditions, the choice of a proper detection system is crucial in order to have the best signal to noise ratio and to solve some problems linked to the specific characteristics of the voltage waveform. This work proposes a comparison between a high frequency ultra wide band (HF UWB), and two different low frequency selective wide band (LF SWB) PD detection systems. The performance of such systems have been assessed during tests performed on twisted pair enameled wire specimens. These tests have been carried out applying pulsed voltage waveforms, while having different amplitudes and rise times, reproducing the output of a switching device. The outcome evidence is that, in the considered conditions, the HF UWB systems cannot provide correct information about the intensity of PD stress and the severity of the relevant degradation. It is also demonstrated that with proper optimizing of the output signal of the LF SWB system, it is possible to obtain reliable quantities that can be used to implement empirical models. Such models can be useful to predict the residual duration of twisted pair specimens, after a short monitoring of PD activity during aging tests. © 2006 IEEE.",

A significant 60% increase of the breakdown electrical field is shown by the microsized microdispersed LDPE/montmorillonite composites while only a 20% increase is obtained with a nano-sized laminar silicate. Nanosized nanodispersed composites of the spherical silica and fibrous silicate with LDPE show a lower increase of the breakdown electrical field. The data point scatter in repeated tests is very high in the case of the microcomposites, indicating strong morphological heterogeneity, while it is very low in the nanocomposites. This implies that these nanocomposites are remarkably defect-free as regards electrically \"weak\" sites. An analysis of the crystalline structure, semicrystalline morphology and inorganic particle size and distribution evidences the importance of the role played not only by the inorganic particles but also by the semicrystalline morphology in the final dielectric performance of the composite. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

      "abstract": "Electrical treeing in LDPE and three LDPE nanocomposites, with spherical silica and fibrous and laminar phyllosilicates, has been studied. Electrical tests were performed at a 50 Hz frequency and voltages between 8 and 29 kV, and the time to inception of the first electrical partial discharges (TTI) of the electrical trees and the time to breakdown (TBD), related to the electrical stability of the insulator, were determined. Above 15 kV all the nanocomposites show longer inception times and shorter tree growth times than LDPE. It is proposed that both observations are caused by the modification of the polymer crystalline morphology induced by the presence of the fillers and by the development of a large number of interfacial structures, both organo-inorganic and amorphous-crystalline. Below 15 kV the TBD is increased in the nanocomposites with the laminar silicate because of tortuosity and the TTI is increased in the fibrous silicate containing a nanocomposite because of the LDPE crystalline morphology in the presence of the silicate. The nanosilica particles decrease the electrical stability in the whole voltage range by decreasing both TTI and TBD. © 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd.",

      "abstract": "Nanocomposite polymers are becoming a new family of dielectric materials with promising insulating properties. In order to apply this technology to insulation systems, a study about the material long-term endurance (life) is needed. In this paper results from comparative life tests performed upon base and nanostructured epoxy resin samples are presented. The nanofiller is a organophillic-modified ultra-clean montmorillonite. Specimens were subjected to ageing under surface discharge phenomena using a standard electrode configuration, that is the CIGRE method II. Life data and partial discharge phase resolved patterns, acquired during time under stress, are presented and commented, in order to characterize the ageing processes that leads to the specimen breakdown and to explain the longer life of the nanocomposite materials. A further insight on the breakdown mechanism is obtained through microscopic observations (using optical and SEM techniques) of the surfaces of the samples before and after ageing and breakdown. A different morphology of the discharge channel walls is observable for base and nanostructured resins. ©2007 IEEE.",

The study focus on the partial discharge (PD) activity associated to electrical treeing, which changes with the harmonic content of the supplied voltage. Different frequency components have been superimposed to a sinusoidal basic waveform and have been applied to suitable specimens. The same RMS voltage amplitude was set for all the considered waveforms. The inception and the growth of electrical treeing were monitored during short term aging tests; the breakdown of the specimens was selected as the endpoint criterion. Two parameters indicating the electrical stress intensity were considered in order to define life pedictive models.

      "abstract": "The present work presents a preliminary research work about electrical treeing inception and growth in polymer-layered silicate nanocomposites. Different silicates were dispersed in an Ethilene-Vynil Acetate (EVA) co-polymer matrix: unmodified and organically modified synthetic fluorohectorite, as well as organically modified natural montmorillonite, were considered. A microcomposite and two nanocomposite compounds were thus obtained and their behaviour under diverging electric field is here investigated and compared to base EVA. In an early stage two parameters were taken into account: Treeing Inception Voltage (TIV) and Breakdown Voltage (BDV). Then, some short term duration tests have been performed, too. The experimental outcome of this investigation (morphology studies and electrical treeing tests) can offer a basis to further understand how the presence of a layered inorganic nanofiller can influence the short term electric performances of nanostructured polymeric materials. © 2005 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "A joint research project University of Genova /Politecnico di Torino regards the influence of selected fillers, inserted to obtain different micro and nanostructured compounds of Ethylen Vynil Acetate (EVA) copolymer, on the surface electrical behaviour, in presence of artificial wet contamination (macroscopic tracking). Three polymer composites have ben realised, of which two contained fluorohectorite as nanofiller. Fluorohectorite is a layered silicate (clay); when its molecules are organically modified, polymeric macromolecules can set between their layers, enabling the formation of nanoscale range geometries along one dimension, thus increasing dramatically the interface interactions. A mix of fluorohectorite (nanofiller) and trihydrate alumina (THA microfiller) is also considered. Suitable tests were carried out on flat specimens in order to rank the performances of the above materials. The electrical tracking tests outcome indicates different results in the case of EVA with THA and fluorohectorite presenting a better behaviour with respect to the other considered materials. © 2005 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Partial Discharge (PD) measurements output, when non-sinusoidal voltages are applied to insulating systems, can have different meanings, depending on the voltage waveform frequency content and on the PD probe circuit. A PD detection circuit is designed for a low noise-to-signal ratio, thus for suppression of the residual high frequency (HF) voltage. Such a suppression varies with the applied voltage rise time: for fast rise rate voltage pulses the PD measurements deserve a specific study. When multiple PD sites are active in the same insulation system and when they give rise to PD inception during the voltage rise/fall, effects due to the signal superimposition should be considered. During quasi-square wave PD tests on twisted pairs the voltage rise rates, the voltage test levels and the high PD repetition rate during voltage \"pulses\" have been suitably inter-played, taking in account analogue and digital PD acquisition systems, in order to evidence the PD measurements actual information content. The obtained results evidenced the limits of high and low frequency PD measurements; in certain instances they did negate both the validity of the relation 〈PD apparent charge vs signal amplitude〉 and the possibility of resolving each single PD pulse. © 2005 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Nanocomposite materials show promising results for applications as electrical insulation. Among several materials presently under investigation, previous works indicate that polypropylene and ethylene-vinilacetate filled by nanosilicates present lower content of space charge and higher electric strength. However, efforts are needed to explain nanocomposite behaviour and characterize their electrical, thermal and mechanical properties. In this paper, the results of broad-band dielectric spectroscopy performed on ethylene-vinylacetate copolymer filled by layered micro and nanosized silicates are reported. The nanofillers consist of montmorillonite and fluorohectorite, that is, natural and synthetic clays. Isochronal and isothermal curves of complex permittivity, as well as activation energies of the relaxation processes are presented and discussed. It is shown that nanostructuration (verified by XRD and TEM analysis) gives rise to substantial changes in the polarisation and dielectric loss behaviour. While the relaxation process of EVA, associated to glass transition of the material amorphous phase, results unchanged, it has been observed the rise of a new process at higher temperatures, having different activation energy in intercalated and exfoliated samples, as well as a change of the distribution of relaxation times.",

      "abstract": "This work is related to a medium term research program which aims at studying the behaviour of twisted pair specimens of enamelled copper wires subjected to high frequency sinusoidal voltage waveforms which are used in some advanced types of electrical machines. High frequency voltages due to, for instance, converter operation are not considered in this paper. The following test conditions were adopted: different voltage amplitudes up to 2 kV, selected voltage frequencies up to 5 kHz and test temperatures up to 200°C. The experimental work aims at defining reference-testing procedures and at studying the aging process of enamelled wires which are usually employed in random windings of electrical machines. As final result, a phenomenological model of the aging process, acting in the considered insulation system, is obtained and it is accurately defined on the grounds of the output data. The type of test method adopted and the type of data processing appear worthy to be used in order to characterise enamelled wires in terms of thermo-electrical degradation processes in presence of partial discharges. © 2005 IEEE.",

These problems affect the copper wires insulating system and the aluminum nitride sheets interposed between two copper electrodes. A diagnostic tool based on partial discharges activity has been considered to obtain information about the resistive section insulating system and the aluminum nitride sheets status. Because of the whole insulating system of the resistive current lead was designed in order to guarantee 5 year of normal operation, accelerated electrical ageing tests were performed considering a more severe stress than the actual one applying a sinusoidal 50 Hz waveform; during the electrical ageing tests the signals relevant to partial discharges were acquired.

Three following main \"weak areas\" within the insulation can been identified: 1) the interface between the layers (it can form a privileged path for a total discharge) 2) the presence of gaseous or metallic inclusions in the dielectric, especially in regions affected by divergent fields 3) the metal coated drilled holes adopted to connect different layers; even in this case the presence of regions with divergent fields can initiate a discharge path. The matter in point has a validity as a method to approach the problem.

A new European research project - ESTAT-Garments - aims to supply the standards body IEC TC101 with a means to assess the effectiveness of ESD garments and to develop appropriate test methods. This paper reviews the requirements for BSD garment test and presents results of measurements of charge transferred and peak BSD current in direct electrostatic discharges obtained from charged fabrics. Results obtained using triboelectrification and direct contact charging methods showed no significant differences. Fabrics could be placed in the following order of increasing charge and peak current corresponding to decreasing surface resistance: carbon core fibre, carbon surface conducting fibre and stainless steel conductive fibre.",

During the tree growth the partial discharges (PDs) were monitored by means of a digital PD acquisition system and the tree morphologies were optically evidenced by means of video recorder equipment. The PD acquired data, the outcome of the video monitoring and the time-to-breakdown were off-line processed and analysed. In this way, two main results were obtained: the first one, applicable to this kind of laboratory treeing tests, is related to the possibility of predicting the lifetime of the specimens, considering a specific PD measurement derived quantity; the second one demonstrates the possibility to detect the tree morphology considering the phase-number distribution obtained by the digital PD measurement. The presented test procedures are deemed to have a potential for diagnostic applications.",

The behaviour of two different kinds of cables, when subjected to such thermal and mechanical stresses, was considered: a PVC insulated cable not propagating fire and a very low (smoke and toxic gasses) emission cable insulated by a LSOH compound. An \"ad hoc\" test cell was designed to study the above insulating materials subjected to the combined stresses. As to the thermal stress, the specimens (a part of a 1.5 mm<sup>2</sup> cable) were subjected to sinusoidal current waves (hundreds of Ampere amplitude, lasting 100 ms) sequentially applied every 5 seconds. The mechanical stress was obtained applying a high pressure crushing the cable to four suitable cylindrical supports. When any cylinder got in contact with the specimen cable copper, an electrical current flew through that cylinder to ground and a max current relay was tripped, stopping the aging test. The proposed test cell and procedure, could be considered as a new \"type testx\" useful to characterize low voltage cables insulation in presence of both thermal and mechanical stresses.",

Special tests were performed on suitable specimens, i.e. on twisted pairs of polyimide-imide enamelled wires. Three different voltage waveforms (peak-to-peak voltage - Vpp levels higher than the PD inception voltage and fundamental frequency equal to 300 Hz) were selected for the tests: a PWM-like, a train of triangular voltages and a sinusoidal shape voltage. The specimens were exposed to PD while hosted in an oven at 100°C, at 5 different Vpp per each waveform. The relevant PD patterns have been measured by means of a digital system, while the five times-to-breakdown (lifetimes) were recorded. The latter curves of lifetimes vs Vpp did fit an inverse power law relation, showing a slope practically independent on the applied voltage waveform.",

In particular the degradation effects of partial discharges (PD) were here experimentally studied. Different (purposely selected and generated) PWM-like waveform voltages have been applied to twisted pairs (polyimide-imide enamelled wires) specimens. The tests have been carried out at 100°C. The relevant PD output (patterns) has been recorded by means of a digital system and the times-to-breakdown of the specimens have been recorded. The various PD patterns appeared consistent with the recorded lifetimes and the planned study has produced both an innovative line of approach and interesting results.",

Hereby are reported some results of an investigation about the behaviour of thin PET and PI films (polymers adopted in the above insulation systems) after exposure to the action of surface partial discharges (PD) due to PWM-like voltages. The relevant damage after suitable agings [different humidity (RH%) and different PD exposure times] has been examined through of a procedure based on charge decay measurements on the aged films surface. After corona (both positive and negative) charging the films, the surface charge distribution was obtained at different times, so to get the charge decay profiles. The relevant results, depending on films, ambient PD aging conditions, and corona polarity, showed different degrees of correlation between the films surface degradation, the surface charge distribution and the measured charge decay profiles. The latter profiles analysis suggests that this approach can offer complementary information to investigate the PD degradation phenomena that would impact on the insulation systems performance.",

This work experimentally investigates the influence of the factor “dv/dt\" (or of the rise-time) characteristic of such quasi-square waves on the output of the above pre-selection tests. The aging test campaign, carried out on twisted pairs, evidenced that the longer the test voltage rise-times (i.e. the lower its “dv/dt\" factor) the shorter is the specimens lifetime. Besides, the monitoring of partial discharges (PD) during the agings showed that this lifetime shortening was consistent with an increased occurrence (number) of PD.

A series of tests has been implemented to answer the following question: does the switching frequency value play a role in the ageing process? Monitoring the partial discharges (PD), twisted pairs were aged at two test temperatures applying voltages having the same fundamental frequency component and different switching frequencies. The life curves obtained at both test temperatures were independent on the switching frequency and were similar. However PD were present only at the voltage polarity reversal of the fundamental component: theoretically PD should have been present also at each switching event. The latter finding would be consistent with the above life curves behaviour, under the assumption that the ageing process is driven by the PD. Further investigations are under way.",

      "abstract": "The behaviour of insulated copper wire windings in presence of power ac voltage and relatively high temperatures from the point of view of the insulation life is reasonably well known. However, the introduction of both modern multiple insulated wire cables and high frequency PWM-like supply voltages can give rise to a lower insulation life than in the previous case. A research program has been rigged to investigate two aspects of this problem. The first aspect regarded a comparison between the life curves behaviour of same twisted pairs enamelled wire specimens in ac high frequency voltage conditions and the life curves in PWM-like voltage conditions: the results evidenced that the above agings are not described by the same mathematical model. The second aspect regarded the study of a testing procedure to qualitatively estimate, in a relatively short time, the weight of the enamelled wire insulation endurance on the long term behaviour of a full insulation winding (represented by segments of an actual winding). The reported results of specific tests evidenced a way to achieve such a goal, therefore to save testing costs and time during the development of an insulation of this type.",

      "abstract": "The effects of anisotropy in samples of EPR insulating compound taken from an HV power cable have been studied analysing suitable electrical tree growth parameters. Certain samples were cut in the radial direction R, others in the longitudinal and tangential direction L and T with respect to the cable extrusion axis. Point plane geometry specimens were obtained inserting 5 μm tip radius needles into such samples by means of a special hot moulding process. As the adhesion between needle tip and EPR compound could influence the final treeing tests results, the needle insertion procedure and the hot moulding process were optimised. The average Tree Inception Voltage (TIV) and the average Breakdown Voltage (BDV) were measured, during AC ramp voltage tests, for each of the three types of specimens. Finally the Time-to-breakdown (Tbd) was recorded during 15 kV AC constant voltage tests, in the three cases. The overall results (BDV and Tbd) clearly indicate that R specimens offer a 'resistance' to treeing growth higher than L ones, while the T specimens behaviour is in between. Therefore it is concluded that, in the bulk of the investigated cable insulation, a significant anisotropy exists. The potential of the above outcome (data and testing procedures) for improving the overall design and/or the manufacturing process of extruded cables for energy transmission applications is recalled.",

The experimental work allowed to select reference testing procedures and produced the results of tests carried out on twisted pairs of enamelled wires at different temperatures, sinusoidal voltages and frequencies. While the research plan regarded such results just as reference for future comparison to the outcome of steep waveform voltage tests, the available data allowed also to formulate, with reasonable accuracy, a phenomenological model of the aging processes acting in the tested insulation.

      "abstract": "It is possible to conceive that the degradation of thin polymer films subjected to surface partial discharges (PD) is due both to the direct PD action and to an electrical aging process due to the electric field acting in the film below the target micro-areas of PD during the instants of discharges. Therefore an innovative testing procedure has been implemented to check such an assertion. Three different polyimide 25 μm thick films have been selected for the surface PD tests. Such tests have been carried out at different humidities till breakdown of the films. The results (lifetimes) obtained in the present case showed no evidence of a contribution of the above electrical aging factor to the films degradation. However this outcome cannot be generalised, as the electrical aging phenomena depend both on the thickness and on the dielectric strength of the films under consideration. When necessary, the here presented testing procedure can be applied to check the situation.",

The relevant investigation regarded both new and 'aged' (that is having a record of 3500 service hours) asynchronous rotating machines, which, after a specific optimization of the testing procedure and of the testing circuit, have been subjected to several PD measuring campaigns, run at four different AC voltages. A suitable analysis of the relevant PD data performed through an `ad hoc' software, allowed to identify several indicators (derived quantities and/or statistical parameters related to the acquired PD patterns) which have a potential for a clear discrimination between new and `aged' insulation. Therefore the results of this preliminary work evidence that a correct application of digital PD measuring techniques can offer a sound basis to develop a tool to monitor the conditions of the insulating system of electrical drives for railways systems.",

On the basis of experimental results of measurements of trees occurring in a needle-plane arrangement, stochastic quantities are derived, which are relevant to PD pulse amplitude and phase. The NN trained by these quantities shows the feasibility of evaluations that connect tree-growth stage, i.e. the amount of damage produced by the tree, with a reduced set of these quantities. This set is, in turn, obtained applying a NN operating for data compression. In this framework, the NN can also recognize a material, among those used for training, associating to it the specific tree-growth feature. © 1998 IEEE.",

The output of PD digital measurements, the outcome (images) of video monitoring and the times-to-breakdown were recorded, off-line processed and analyzed. Two main results were obtained. The existence of a linear relation between a specific quantity derived from the PD data and the times-to-breakdown was proven and allows to implement lifetime predictions (applicable to laboratory treeing tests on EVA polymers). In parallel, a different processing of the PD data patterns allowed to link the shape of phase-number PD histograms to the tree shape during treeing growth. While the first obtained results offer a possibility to shorten the testing times (and the relevant costs), the second ones demonstrate that the different shapes of an electrical tree can be detected also in opaque materials, as non visual means can be used. The tested procedures are deemed to have a potential for diagnostic applications.",

The proposed model hinges on the role of the films surface conductivity variations with RH and its validity is supported by the results of life tests performed on two different polymer films and by the examination of optical microscope images of the PD damaged areas. The assumptions of the model are basically consistent with the outcome of surface conductivity measurements performed on non PD aged films. This model can be useful in the selection of polymer films and/or of surface treatments for industrial applications where the `resistance' to PD at different RH levels is critical.",

      "abstract": "Three polymers, polyethylene terephthalate, a polyimide, and polyamide-6, were subjected to surface partial discharges up to electrical breakdown under varying ambient humidity conditions. It was found that increasing humidity increases lifetime of the samples until a critical value of relative humidity is attained, after which the polymers' lifetime dramatically decreases. This critical value depends on the hydrophylicity of the polymer and is lower as the ability of the polymer to absorb water increases. The evolution of the electrical time to breakdown with the relative humidity is explained in terms of changes in surface conductivity following variations in the ambient humidity.",

      "abstract": "Current digital systems for the measurement of partial discharges (PD) in electrical insulation tend to flood the researchers with a wealth of data. They contain several types of information about the PD processes. These large sets of `raw' acquired data are of difficult direct interpretation and are usually subjected to postprocessing and analysis techniques to extract the desired information. Among other methods, the use of statistical tools and the implementation of neural networks (NN) have been proposed for such an analysis. The paper will describe how these two techniques have been jointly exploited to process PD patterns derived from experimental acquisitions relevant to electrical treeing phenomena in EPR compounds. We shall show that the overall output of the proposed analysis method allowed to discriminate between different materials, in which the treeing structures were actively present. In particular it will be evidenced that a NN approach can be successfully adopted to select an appropriate subset of ten parameters (out of 56 different quantities computed applying to the `raw' data statistical tools). Such a subset can then be used as a new input data set to train/test other neural networks with comparable error rates.",

Accelerated life tests were performed until breakdown, measuring partial discharge evolution with time, by a test arrangement suitable to induce surface discharges on insulating material specimens. Harmonic voltages having different frequencies and phase, in the range of those usually recorded in electrical plants, were superimposed to the fundamental component. The tested material is polyethylene terephthalate. Either reduction or increase of life, with respect to sinusoidal conditions, were detected, dependently on the way as harmonic voltages are summed up. In particular, significant life shortening was obtained in the cases when voltage maximum is increased due to the contribution of harmonics. These result can be directly correlated with the partial-discharge pattern structure.",

In this way it will be possible to define one or more experimental models that can lead to identify the degradation level of the material and then to estimate its life time. The characteristic quantities are obtained through elaboration of the apparent charge that is measured and acquired by means of a digital measurement system; they are identified as 'external power' and 'apparent current'.

      "abstract": "In the last decade, multistage digital measuring systems of partial dlscharaesfPDs) have been introduced, allowing to support the diagnostic of defects (sites of PDs) in power electric components. They transfer information about defects from full data sets of PD patterns, obtained from a Phase Resolved Partial Discharge Analyser (PRPDA) to reduced data sets, by implementing pattern recognition techniques. The latter data sets are then classified versus similar reference data sets. The validity of the above diagnostic requires that the measuring process, which is influenced by several factors, is optimised. The three main settings of the PRPDA are among such factors of influence, but so far, as a simple mathematical model of this measuring process is not available, it has not been possible to quantitatively assess their \"weight\" on the validity of above diagnostic. This work presents a successful \"Design Of Experiments\" (DOE) approach to solve the latter problem. The DOE analysis of the results of 81 PD tests performed on a simple physical model of an insulation system quantified the weight and the interaction of the three factors and allowed to derive criteria for selecting the \"optimal\" values of such factors and the \"optimal\" composition of the reduced data sets.",

In case of anomalous tg S values detection a problem arises: fast and reliable procedures to identify the defects and the \"causes of non-conformity\" are needed to drive a prompt correcting action on the production line. This work presents an innovative measuring procedure to solve such problems: the localisation sources of partial discharges (PD) by means of the simultaneous detection (through an electric method) of the PD signals and of the related sound waves (through an acoustic method). While a \"new\" acoustic measuring method employing two ultrasonic sensors was devised, a classic PD digital detection was adopted. The delay time between the two signals was the base to measure, under given sensitivity conditions and through a zeroing technique, the location of PD sites (defects), with an error of 2-3 cm on 2400×18×54 mm insulated bars. The longitudinal and the transversal velocities of the sound waves for each defect in each tested bar. Such a measuring procedure was then successfully validated testing three insulated bars (one of them contained an artificial void).",

The relevant output consists of large amounts of data, in the form of PD patterns; therefore it arises the need of simple and effective methods to elaborate such data for a given purpose. For example, it has been showed that parameters resulting from a statistical analysis of PD patterns can allow to determine the nature of PD sites. Whatever the purpose, the output of the patterns analysis is dependent on the operator's choice of the digital measuring system settings. In this work it is evidenced that it is possible to make such a choice independent from the operator, implementing suitable Design Of Experiment (DOE) techniques. In this way it is possible to avoid any misleading effect on the diagnostics based on the analysis of such PD patterns. While the present experimental work has been performed on films (materials) subjected to PDs, it is deemed that the extension of the DOE techniques application to the diagnostics of electrical components is very promising.",

As such a dependence is different for different kinds of discharge sites, it is proposed to consider the dependence on degradation time or on the applied voltage as a complementary information useful to perform the diagnostic of insulation systems.",

      "abstract": "The work presented in this paper consists of a systematic study on the influence of moisture on the behaviour of polymers submitted to Partial Discharges. Three chemically different polymers have been submitted to PD until breakdown, varying the relative humidity from 17% to 83%. Qualitatively the same evolution of the samples' lifetime with moisture is found for the three of them. Lifetime increases with increasing humidity up to a critical value; further increase in moisture involves quick dimishing of lifetime. This value seems to depend on the ability to absorb water of each of the polymers.",

Therefore the need of simple and effective methods to elaborate the large amount of available data, relevant to PD activity, arises. For example, it has already showed that parameters resulting from statistical analysis of PD patterns can allow to determine the nature of PD sites. Nevertheless the significance of the statistical parameters can be strongly affected by the measurement system characteristics and, in particular, by its adjustments. In the paper it is shown how the characteristics of the measurement system (amplifier gains, acquisition time lag, number of channels) can affect the PD patterns and relevant statistical parameters. For this purpose, two different experimental set-up have been adopted, measuring PDs which act on the surface of polymeric films or inside tree channels. In this way, the acquired PDs were also relevant to different degradation levels of the PD site.",

The divergent field is generally obtained by means of point plane electrode geometries, where the point (needle) electrode can be either conductive or semiconductive. The main part of tests on this subject has been performed at ambient temperature, even though the service temperature of the insulation can be quite higher. In the paper it is shown how the temperature can affect both the different phases of the treeing phenomena (i.e. tree inception, tree growth and final breakdown) and the PD patterns, which are relevant to PDs acting inside the tree channels. Experiments have been performed on ethylene-vynilacetate copolymer (EVA) applying different constant AC voltage levels. Temperature effects on the time to tree inception, on the time to breakdown and on the tree growth are presented. Furthermore it is shown that PD patterns and their relevant statistical parameters can be significantly affected by a variation of temperature. In particular the variation versus time of some of the statistical parameters is temperature dependent.",

Nevertheless humidity in the insulation can have an effect also on other degradation processes which are generally studied under dry conditions such as the prebreakdown phenomena under divergent field (electrical treeing tests). The paper highlights that the water content strongly affects the pre-breakdown phenomena both as concerns the tree growth rate and the relevant Partial Discharges (PD) activity. Experiments have been performed on ethylene-vynilacetate copolymer (EVA) both applying different constant AC voltage levels and applying increasing voltage amplitude. A point-plane electrode geometry was adopted and specimens with and without an artificial void (controlled geometry) set in front of the needle point. Specimens had been conditioned by means of a storage in an oven where saturated humidity ambient was present. Different conditioning times were adopted. Tree inception voltage (TIV), breakdown voltage (BDV), tree length vs. the applied voltage or vs. the aging time, time to breakdown and the patterns relevant to PD which act inside the tree branches, are the measured outputs of the experiments.",

The tests are performed on specimens displaying either an intimate contact of the needle with the copolymer or an artificial void at the needle tip. It is shown that the stochastic behavior of the pulse charge height distribution depends on test conditions, but generally fits well a two-parameter Weibull function when either partial discharges occur in the void or tree grows into the polymer in the absence of artificial void. A five-parameter Weibull function can be used to fit data which are obtained when the detected partial discharges are due to both tree growing into the polymer and partial discharge evolution into the artificial void. Estimation of the Weibull parameter values, as well as of other statistical indexes, can describe well the observed partial discharge phenomena and provide useful diagnostic tools.",

The usefulness of such a method to locate discharge sources in hydrogenerator stator bars is illustrated. The adopted measuring procedure, based on two piezo-electric transducers positioned on a bar, allows the identification of the discharge site position within an error range of ~ 2 cm. Such a measuring procedure appears useful as a diagnostic tool in quality control for bars that do not pass the specified acceptance test or in the development of new insulating systems.

In particular, the probability distribution of the charge height is investigated resorting to the two-parameter Weibull function. The PD data obtained from measurements of tree growth in specimens of EVA copolymer subjected to constant voltage, at room temperature, are considered. Two configurations of the point-plane electrode geometry are tested, which differ for the presence or not of an artificial void at the needle tip. It is shown that the probability distribution of the PD-pulse height is well described by the two parameter Weibull function when tree grows in the insulation, in the absence of the artificial void, or PDs are occurring in the void, before inception of tree in the insulation. The Weibull parameters are related to tree-growth features and are sensitive to transition of tree from void to insulation.",

The results of tests performed, from 50 Hz up to 1000 Hz, on three different polymer films indicate, that no constant acceleration factor can be assumed, even for same material with different thicknesses. Therefore it appears that a correct comparison of different thin polymer films surface partial discharges endurance, in general and especially when using the presently adopted testing procedure, should be made on the grounds of results of tests performed at the service frequency. Nevertheless frequency accelerated tests could be useful to compare same films (polymer and thickness), as in the case of Quality Control procedures, in a relatively short time.",

A variety of polymer films were tested in different atmospheric conditions (humidity, closed or open configurations) with several ground electrode systems (varnish, sputter, etc.). Polymer films were coated with ceramic layers in order to increase the lifetime. It is shown that the partial discharges are modified by the material surface properties and the corona resistance test is hence not objective. However, the increased amount of experimental information allows a much better understanding of sample failure mechanisms than the recording of lifetime only.

      "abstract": "Tests have been performed on a test pattern designed to study the effects of applying voltage to the inside of the package. The need to apply high voltage to the internal connections of the package, without discharges occurring outside the package, has led to the design of a metal frame having only two leads spaced 16 mm apart. Specimens having three different distances between the bonding pads (60 mu m, 100 mu m, and 160 mu m) have been prepared. Test patterns for the three kinds have been subjected to breakdown tests by applying an increasing 50 Hz voltage. No meaningful breakdown voltage (BDV) difference appeared between the results for each test set, demonstrating that the discharges occur not in the encapsulant, but through the passivation layer. Consequently, new test patterns having a double thickness oxide layer have been manufactured in order to stress the encapsulant with a higher field strength. The discharge test results have shown increased values of BDV, yet no meaningful differences between the BDV of each set have been found, indicating that the discharge path was through the oxide layer even with a double layer. The results support the possibility of implementing power plastic packages which work at higher than usual voltage by modifying the metal frame.",

The recurrent formation of PDs in the gap creates damage which can lead to breakdown. It had been suggested previously that the damage to thin polymer films during tests of this kind can be related to synergic factors: The action on the film surface of the discharges and the effect of electrical aging in the bulk of the film present during the discharge time windows. In order to clarify the effect of the electrical aging factor on the duration of the films during PD testing it was necessary to devise a way to separate the contribution of the two factors, maintaining the conditions driving the first factor and changing the stress present on the film during discharge periods, when the air gap is short-circuited. The initial assumption that the damage to thin dielectric films during surface PD tests can be related to the two above-mentioned synergic factors was confirmed.",

The cause of each component was identified by means of a special nonlinear iterative algorithm based on the least-squares method. The results of this investigation show an influence of the additive content and of the temperature on the charging current that can be ascribed to the bulk composition of the materials. It is noted that it is very important to fit the experimental data in order to obtain the correct values of the steady-state conduction currents, which are more significant than the currents obtained at a fixed time.",
