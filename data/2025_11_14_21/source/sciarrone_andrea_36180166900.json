      "abstract": "Objective: The case highlights the rarity and complexity of penoscrotal transposition (PST), emphasizing the need for multidisciplinary management and early prenatal diagnosis. Case(s): A 36-year-old primigravida with a 20-week oocyte donation dichorionic diamniotic pregnancy was referred due to an abdominopelvic cyst and absent left kidney in one fetus. Prenatal screening by cell-free DNA showed low aneuploidy risk and the presence of a Y chromosome, and no invasive diagnostic procedures were performed due to the patient’s refusal. Ultrasound revealed megacystis, hyperechogenic kidneys, and suspected PST in the male twin. The patient underwent cesarean delivery at 35+2 weeks, with subsequent diagnosis of penoscrotal transposition. Conclusion: Prenatal diagnosis of penoscrotal transposition is challenging. This case underscores the importance of genital assessment during referral scans, particularly in the presence of urinary tract anomalies.",

      "abstract": "False-positive or false-negative detection, and the resulting inappropriate treatments in cancer metastasis cases, have led to numerous fatal instances due to human errors. Traditional cancer diagnoses are often subjectively interpreted through naked-eye observation, which can vary among different medical practitioners. In this research, we propose a novel deep learning-based framework called Intelligent Tumor Analytics (ITA). ITA facilitates on-the-fly assessment of Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) at the histopathological level, primarily utilizing cellular appearance, spatial arrangement, and the relative proximities of various cell types (e.g., tumor cells, immune cells, and other objects of interest) observed within scanned WSI images of tumors. By automatically quantifying relevant indicators and estimating their scores, ITA establishes a standardized evaluation that aligns with widely recognized international tumor grading standards, including the TNM and Nottingham Grading Standards. The objective measurements and assessments offered by ITA provide informative and unbiased insights to users (i.e., pathologists) involved in determining prognosis and treatment plans. The quantified information regarding tumor risk and potential for further metastasis possibilities serves as crucial early knowledge during cancer development.",

      "abstract": "The use of multiple access protocols information in Internet of Things (IoT) environments has gained significant interest over the past decade, particularly for crowd behavior monitoring. Due to its high data rates and low infrastructure requirements, WiFi is considered one of the most promising wireless technologies for leveraging the explosive growth of transmitted data from mobile devices. However, with the introduction of MAC address randomization and the application of new randomization policies on assigning randomized sequence numbers (SNs) to transmitted frames in mobile devices to enhance privacy, traditional approaches to device identification face significant challenges. To tackle this issue, we conduct a comprehensive analysis at the multiple access level and propose CrowdWatch which is an innovative framework designed to enhance the understanding and utilization of MAC randomization dynamics. Additionally, we introduce a novel approach that leverages multiple device-specific features to accurately associate frames with randomized MAC addresses to their corresponding devices. By integrating multimodal fingerprints, the framework can effectively identify mobile devices and track their behavior. The presented approach ensures reliable detection even under the latest randomization policies. We examined the introduced framework through real-world experiments, and the findings prove that it is an effective solution for smart building management and occupancy estimation in dynamic environments.",

      "abstract": "This paper explores the complex dynamics of Wi-Fi probe request frames, focusing on their transmission behaviors and the implications for user privacy. As mobile devices become increasingly sophisticated, their capacity for wireless communication presents both opportunities for enhanced connectivity and privacy-related challenges. This study examines critical features of probe request frames and their role in device fingerprinting. We highlight the challenges and advancements in communicating between mobile devices and nearby networks by analyzing the randomization policies employed by various operating systems and their effectiveness in masking device identities. Through comprehensive experiments conducted across multiple mobile devices and operating system versions, we capture and analyze probe request frames under different user-device interaction phases. Our findings indicate variations in transmission frequency and the impact of connection states on broadcasting characteristics. We also investigate the deployed randomization policies in different brands of mobile devices, uncovering their influence on privacy preservation. This research provides notable insights for developing more effective wireless communication approaches, contributing to the broader goal of enhancing user privacy in this field.",

      "abstract": "Multi-agent collaborative perception can mitigate individual blind spots by sharing and integrating sensory data, thereby providing a more comprehensive understanding of the surrounding environment. However, challenges remain, particularly in feature fusion, where issues such as redundancy, localization errors, and the trade-off between perceptual accuracy and real-time performance must be addressed. In this paper, we propose the Triple-Attention Collaborative Perception (TA-CoPe) framework, which employs hybrid channel attention, frequency attention, and spatial attention to enhance feature representation across these dimensions, optimizing the fusion and selection of multi-dimensional features. Additionally, a dynamic gating mechanism with adaptive weight learning assigns varying weights to each module, dynamically optimizing their contributions to the final output, thus improving both the accuracy and robustness of feature fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on two public datasets in multi-agent perception tasks.",

Specifically, monitoring respiration is a critical component of this evolution, offering a straightforward yet effective method for assessing an individual's health status. In this paper, we introduce an innovative contactless approach to respiration monitoring that leverages Channel State Information (CSI) from Wi-Fi channels. By analyzing variations in the amplitude and phase of CSI data, we infer human respiration patterns. To validate our method, we conducted experiments with multiple subjects in indoor environments, assessing the system's capability to track the respiration cycle and determine breathing frequency. We also compared the performance of various AI algorithms in identifying accurate breath rates. Our findings indicate that the CSI-based system is a promising solution for respiration monitoring, achieving an average accuracy of approximately 84% in estimating breathing frequency, thus paving the way for future studies to enhance the robustness of the proposed approach.",

In the context of structural health monitoring (SHM), this integrated vision provides a powerful framework to tackle challenges, such as limited resources, harsh environments, and the need for timely, high-fidelity data. By enabling intelligent, collaborative processing across edge and network layers, it supports efficient data compression, transmission, and decision-making—ensuring robust and adaptive monitoring even in complex structural settings. In this work, we investigate the use of AI for data compression in an IoT-based SHM scenario. Specifically, we evaluate and compare the performance of four different convolutional autoencoder (convolutional AEs (CAEs)) in compressing and reconstructing inertial signals collected from various structural systems, aiming to enable adaptive and context-aware processing directly at the edge. By testing across heterogeneous sources, we assess the generalizability and robustness of each CAE model, providing insights into the potential of deep learning-based compression techniques for SHM applications.",

      "abstract": "The healthcare landscape is undergoing a transformative shift driven by the rapid advancements of sixth-generation (6G) cellular networks and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. This convergence has led to the emergence of medical digital twins (MDTs) — innovative virtual replicas of physical entities or processes. MDTs enable safe monitoring and testing of therapeutic decisions, resulting in substantial cost savings and enhanced decision-making capabilities for physicians. Furthermore, they provide real-time assistance and facilitate comprehensive data analysis, revolutionizing patient care. However, their full potential is constrained by the intricate nature of human life cycles. Key factors include the choice of data types and the communication protocols used to connect physical and digital twins. For individuals with disabilities, integrating wearable devices with edge computing and WiFi-based Channel State Information (CSI) can effectively monitor health metrics and recognize activities. Although the integration of 6G and IoT technologies holds the promise of enabling seamless communication between physical and digital twins, this paper, which is developed in the framework of the HIPPOCRATES project, focuses on a currently implementable architecture for MDTs based on the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol.

      "abstract": "Mobile devices with enabled Wi-Fi continuously discover nearby access points by broadcasting management frames known as probe requests. This broadcasting leaks fingerprints that can be used to identify the presence and movement of flow in a given area. To protect users' privacy and location, probe requests use randomized MAC addresses generated according to the randomization protocols. In this paper, we analyze the behavior and characteristics of probe request frames across different devices from various vendors, operating systems, and features, as well as the influence of user-device interaction in different phases. In particular, we provide a detailed examination of the adoption of MAC address randomization techniques to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of recent randomization policies and to demonstrate that, despite the OS implementation, there is still potential to utilize open Wi-Fi in different services and development.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, the increase in the elderly population has placed significant burdens on post-rehabilitation schemes, resulting in high logistical costs and considerable social impacts due to hospitalization or frequent visits. These challenges call for a transformation in the traditional approach to physical patient care, which can be achieved by leveraging the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), particularly through the use of pervasive wearable sensors. When attached to patients during treatment or therapy, these sensors can provide valuable supplementary information to healthcare professionals. When it comes to adopting IoMT technologies, cost efficiency, portability, and generalization are key factors. Specifically, this study aims to enhance the cost-effectiveness and versatility of wearable eHealth monitoring architectures that utilize foot pressure-sensing hardware for the motor assessment of post-stroke and neurologically impaired patients. It leverages lower limb inertial measurement unit sensory information and machine learning to mitigate the reliance on foot pressure-sensing hardware. We demonstrate the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in predicting fine-scale foot pressure using only inexpensive, off-the-shelf motion sensors. We propose a self-supervised, exercise-agnostic asynchronous foot pressure decoding model that does not require human annotation. The algorithm is thoroughly evaluated using appropriate performance metrics, and our experimental tests show promising results.",

      "abstract": "Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) enables several emerging applications while suffering severe security issues. In this article, the novel illegal sensing suppression (ISS) is proposed to protect the privacy of the specific legitimate user in the presence of an adversary with the sensing capacity in the ISAC system. The target detection and the direction of arrival estimation as common sensing tasks are investigated to deteriorate the sensing performance at the adversary side. To this end, we propose the missed detection probability maximization and the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) maximization-based ISS model. This model also ensures the achievable rate and the legitimate sensing CRB toward the adversary at the ISAC base station side. The beamforming optimization algorithms are developed based on the alternating optimization and semidefinite relaxation techniques in order to address the nonconvex issue in the formulated ISS models and explore the rate-ISS tradeoff in the ISAC system. We further propose the closed-form solution for the single user case in the target detection suppression scenario. Numerical results demonstrate the necessity of the ISS and the ISS gain of proposed algorithms compared with other baseline schemes.",

      "abstract": "Structural health monitoring (SHM) is a process aimed at studying variations in the expected behavior of a structure in order to locate damage, material deterioration and other abnormalities. To this aim, SHM is usually performed continuously, thus generating large amounts of data, often by employing wired, expensive and proprietary systems. Introducing low-cost, low-energy consumption and low-rate IoT devices allows for cheaper and easier installations also in scenarios where computation and transmission resources are limited. Since many structural signals (e.g., vibrations) are sparse in the frequency domain, it is possible to apply well-known compressive sensing (CS) techniques to limit the amount of information to be transmitted. CS allows recovering a vector using a reduced amount of entries, thus being able to perform sub-Nyquist sampling. This article shows the results obtained by applying CS to inertial signals coming from wireless IoT devices, developed as laboratory prototypes, applied to real structures (specifically, a bridge). Such findings are further expanded by discussing the efficiency of CS with respect to the number of used samples and its feasibility for IoT applications, from the transmission burden and energy consumption standpoints.",

      "abstract": "Despite recent advancements, Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) remains a difficult task, particularly when dealing with drone videos. A variety of challenges, such as data association, varying levels of occlusion, camera motion, and missing detection, affect the effectiveness of MOT tasks. Data association in tracking-by-detection approaches plays a critical role in determining how detections from previous frames are linked to generate coherent tracks. To address this challenge, merging spatial and visual cues may not lead to identical matching pairs for the given detections and tracks. Thus, the performance of the MOT task can be improved by pairing them individually and then determining the best matching pair. It is therefore proposed a Multi-Class MOT (MCMOT) tracker with a cascaded data association strategy in which, during the first stage, matching pairs based on appearance and spatial information are identified separately. The best matching pair is then identified out of these pairs in the second stage and updated as an active track. In addition, the Kalman Filter (KF) estimation and Constant Velocity Assumption (CVA) model are employed to effectively address scenarios involving missed detections and occlusion handling by utilizing motion data. Experiments were carried out on the two state-of-the-art datasets, VisDrone-MOT and UA-DETRAC, to validate the effectiveness of the proposed MCMOT tracker, which demonstrated the improved performance when compared against six different state-of-the-art trackers by providing as input different detectors.",

      "abstract": "Human balance is essential for everyday activities, from basic functions like standing and walking to more complex movements required in sports and work tasks. Optimal balance reduces the risk of falls, a major cause of injuries among the elderly and individuals with certain medical conditions. However, traditional force platforms can be prohibitively expensive for smaller clinics and individual practitioners, and patients with mobility issues may find it difficult to access locations equipped with such platforms. In light of these challenges, this work explores the effectiveness and versatility of using simpler hardware for pressure sensing. As an alternative to conventional force platforms, low-cost wearable sensors, such as Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs), have been explored. This research focuses on developing a simple yet effective balance evaluation system using smart-glasses embedded with an IMU sensor to replace traditional feet pressure sensing machines. Furthermore, we developed a custom dataset for the estimation of sway parameters by simultaneously collecting the IMU data and labels from the force platform for a set of 20 participants. We experimented with various Deep Learning (DL) models, leveraging the latest advancements in Machine Learning (ML), to estimate sway parameters such as sway path, sway area, and their ratio, typically measured by the gold standard force platform. When evaluated with appropriate performance criteria, the experimental results indicate that our proposed methodology performs robustly using only accelerometer data.",

      "abstract": "Brain stroke is a pathology affecting a significant number of people worldwide. A fast diagnosis is required to administer the correct therapy and frequent monitoring is usually necessary during follow-up. Microwave imaging represents a promising technology able to address such needs and that may complement gold-standard systems. In this framework, a novel Lebesgue-space approach for microwave imaging of stroke is presented in this paper. The developed method combines an inexact-Newton inversion technique in variable-exponent Lebesgue spaces with a data-driven regularization term. In this way, a-priori information about the configuration under test, e.g., the head structure, can be exploited and the convergence of the method can be enhanced. The method is preliminarily evaluated by means of numerical simulations involving realistic head phantoms. The obtained results confirm that the developed approach allows identifying and characterizing the stroke with a good accuracy.",

Timely and adequate treatments play a fundamental role since radically different therapies are required for ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, and a misdiagnosis can cause further damage. In this scenario, microwave imaging is emerging as a powerful tool for non-invasive diagnostics [1]. However, it requires the solution of a problem that is inherently non-linear and ill-posed.

Thus, the goal of this work is to improve the performance of tail categories in long-tail aerial datasets while enhancing or at-least maintaining the performance of head categories. To achieve this, a weighting and re-weighting strategy is proposed that focuses on the foreground-foreground disparity in classes at the dataset level, thereby enhancing the accuracy of less prevalent categories. The proposed strategy is evaluated using two long-tail aerial datasets, the drone-based VisDrone DETection (VisDroneDET) and the Satellite Imagery Multivehicles Dataset (SIMD), and one-stage object detection models. Compared to baseline models, most tail categories show significant performance improvements, highlighting the importance of the weighting strategy to address class imbalances in long-tail object detection.",

      "abstract": "Object recognition is a quite critical task that involves the identification and potential localization of a target inside a monitored area. Target detection usually relies on material, shape and size identification in order to infer higher level information, and it can be employed in many different frameworks and applications. In this connection, we carry out a performance evaluation campaign on WiFi Channel State Information (CSI)-based object recognition techniques used to automatically identify material, category and specific objects among daily life items. The main contribution of this work is to provide a thorough comparison of the performance of different machine learning algorithms on recognition using a real-life experimental testbed. The performance study shows that the Random Forest (RF) classifier proves very accurate in terms of correct target recognition, independently of the considered task. The employed deep learning algorithm, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), is similarly able to attain very good results. In particular, accuracy values reach 94.8% in material identification, 97.1% in category differentiation and 98.1% in object recognition tasks.",

      "abstract": "Contactless patient monitoring is one of the most trending topics in eHealth, due to the utmost importance of non-invasive tele-enabled biomedical systems in next-generation healthcare. In this connection, this work investigates Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using commodity 5GHz WiFi devices, exploiting Channel State Information (CSI) to distinguish among a set of actions performed by different people. The position and movements of the human body affect wireless signal reflections and, consequently, CSI. Data collected from wireless packets are organized into the CSI matrix, which describes the status of the link at each time instant. In this work we employ amplitude and phase information, related to the variations in CSI values, to classify human activities leveraging simple machine learning techniques. Different radio link modes are also compared to evaluate their impact on the classification performance. Experimental results show that CSI data is capable of providing very accurate results in classifying activities performed by different people, especially when considering phase-related information in a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) configuration, thus making CSI-based HAR a promising solution for contactless patient monitoring.",

      "abstract": "Alongside many traditional as well as novel applications, in the latest years, drones have been widely adopted as remote sensing platforms for road traffic monitoring in urban areas and on highways. The problem of traffic monitoring on Region of Interest (RoI) based on drone imagery is a challenging task, especially when the surveillance drone is constantly moving. In this work, two specific subtasks have been addressed. The goal of the first stage is to predict the RoI in drone imagery of traffic scenes using deep-learning (DL)-based approaches instead of traditional image processing; in this connection, the goal of the second task is to perform vehicle detection on the selected RoI. To ensure diversity and robustness, drone images with different altitudes, positions, and view points have been considered. To achieve these goals, two custom aerial data sets for RoI extraction and detection were built by collecting aerial sequences from flying unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and by transmitting them to the base station leveraging 5G technology. Two different ad hoc DL-based architectures have been designed for the RoI extraction task to maximize the accuracy and inference speed, respectively, and have been evaluated on two different data sets: 1) a custom-built data set and 2) a Massachusetts roads data set. Finally, the models providing the best performance have been combined to further improve the overall results. Experimental tests show that the proposed framework represents a promising solution for drone-based road traffic monitoring in critical areas, exploiting imagery from a variety of viewing angles and altitudes.",

      "abstract": "Compressive Sensing (CS) is a sampling technique which, provided the sparsity of the arrival domain and specific properties of the reconstruction matrix, allows rebuilding a vector starting from a significantly small subset of measures. This paves the way to a plethora of applications, ranging from specialized frameworks, such as medical imaging, to more general purposes, such as data compression. Among these, Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is a primary and current topic, focused on analyzing structures to determine their residual lifespan and their health conditions (material degradation, damage localization, disaster prevention, etc.), In this regard, CS is able to provide accurate results, at the same time limiting the amount of data needed to propagate information between different end-points. Indeed, SHM usually deals with continuous flows of information originating from heterogeneous sensors and locations, often characterized by diverse computational power and signal coverage. In this paper we apply CS to signals coming from two different structures, i.e., a laboratory model and a bridge. Results show that CS is a viable way of reconstructing the considered signals by exploiting a subset of samples while still maintaining a high degree of precision, achieving an average normalized RMSE of 0.12.",

The application of such methods to pediatric stroke has never been explored, despite the potential usefulness in many cases. The goal of this work is to start approaching this problem, with a preliminary assessment through numerical simulations. After the development of voxel-based models of stroke-affected child heads, the forward electromagnetic problem has been solved by means of a finite-difference time-domain solver in a three-dimensional configuration. Preliminary numerical reconstructions of the dielectric properties of head tissues have also been carried out by means of a nonlinear inverse-scattering procedure.",

      "abstract": "Compressive Sensing (CS) is a sampling technique that challenges the traditional sampling scheme introduced by the Whittaker-Shannon theorem. Under certain conditions, a signal can be sampled at rates lower than the Nyquist rate, introducing a different kind of approach to signal handling, both in the acquisition and in the reconstruction phases. CS relies on the property of sparsity, the idea that a signal possesses an amount of information which is smaller than the amount of data required to store it. This paper employs the CS approach to inertial signals sensed by innovative IoT devices by showing applications of real-world infrastructure monitoring. Numerical results show that our approach is able to efficiently estimate the infrastructures modal frequencies with an innovative inertial IoT prototype by achieving a compression level around 20 times below the Nyquist rate.",

      "abstract": "Stroke diagnostics may benefit from an early detection and a continuous monitoring of the disease, which is possible thanks to the application of electromagnetic imaging systems. However, the inverse problem that should be tackled to retrieve a quantitative microwave image of the dielectric properties of the head tissues presents many challenging points, i.e., ill-posedness, non-linearity, and weak stroke response. In the framework of Lebesgue-space methods with adaptive exponent functions, the present paper proposes the adoption of a simultaneous processing of multifrequency data. Initial results coming from a numerical assessment with a detailed three-dimensional phantom of the human head are presented and discussed, analyzing the case of a simulated hemorrhagic event.",

      "abstract": "According to data traffic forecast reported in Cisco (2018), the volume of data transported by Internet in 2021 will exceed the threshold of 3.0 ZB per year, generated by roughly 30 billions of devices. SATCOM's capability to bring Internet connectivity in parts of the world that until few years ago was impossible to reach (e.g., in the middle of the ocean), the use of satellite platforms for M2M services has become more and more widespread, with an unprecedented increase over the last five years (see Herrero and De Gaudenzi, 2012 and Scalise et al., 2013) and expected further diffusion in the near future. One of the most interesting applications, enabled by the Internet of Things (IoT), that has attracted significant attention in the M2M field is the personal vocal assistant (PVA). It is a software agent that can perform tasks or services for an individual based on commands or questions given through voice instructions. The main contribution of this article is a performance analysis, both theoretical and simulated, of satellite networks for PVA services over cruise ships. Namely, a PVA must provide feedback to the user in a short amount of time to guarantee a high Quality of Experience (QoE) Zhang et al., 2013. For this analysis, we tested different satellite providers and we come to a conclusion regarding their feasibility as a reference network for the PVS employment on a cruise ship. Future studies will investigate the proposed scenario by broadening the performance analysis through actual measurements over a real-world satellite channel to practically demonstrate the validity of our approach.",

A recent boom in the field of deep learning (DL) has provided remarkable development in the problem of vehicle detection. Aerial views pose more complexity with respect to the ground view but the rapid advancement in the field of DL, the volume of data, and hardware configuration has facilitated the realization of these intelligent detection systems effectively. In this article, a detailed performance evaluation of some of the main state-of-the-art DL-based object detection techniques has been carried out along with an experimental analysis of vehicle detection using the RetinaNet framework on the VisDrone-benchmark data set. The performance of the RetinaNet framework has been validated together with the results provided by the VisDrone team. Further experiments are then conducted to investigate the impact of various parameters. Finally, the selection of suitable models that can be practically implemented is also discussed based both on a qualitative and quantitative analysis.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly utilized in smart cities to perform traffic monitoring tasks such as multiple object detection and tracking. The task's criticality is dependent on the drones' dynamic altitude, movable camera, and various viewing angles. These challenges are addressed once the UAVs' collected data is received. However, parameters affecting drone data collecting flight operations must also be explored, including drone actual flight time, data collection time, and energy consumption profile. The drone flight time would depend upon the battery capacity and energy consumption profile, which comprises drone movement, data collection, and communication energies. Besides, data collection energy consumption is subjected to video quality, frame rates, and data compression. The installed battery in UAVs is of limited capacity and determining actual flight time, data collection time, and energy consumption profile based on the factors mentioned above is critical. This paper develops and examines a drone energy consumption profile and proposes a drone flight strategy in a surveillance scenario to correctly estimate the drone's actual flight time, data collection time, and the distance the drone could travel from its original location. The results of this analysis are presented as a test case for flying a drone to collect the traffic monitoring data.",

      "abstract": "Drones and video processing have become a vital and integrated aspect of smart city development in several applications such as search and rescue, surveillance and delivery. Newly, camera-equipped drones are flown, and high-resolution photos and video data are relayed via a communication link to the base station. Apart from tackling the video processing issues in applications, such as object identification and tracking, energy consumption that may present a stumbling block in completing a successful drone flight for data collecting must be highlighted and considered. Drones have a limited amount of energy storage, which must be used to power the drone's movement, hovering, data collection, and communication. This study aims at building and testing a drone energy profile that estimates the total energy consumed and a maximum flying time of a drone in a traffic monitoring scenario. Additionally, the relationship between the video processing task and the drone energy profile is explored to determine the optimal strategy for flying the drones while maintaining the video processing task's performance. The conclusion of this evaluation and investigation can be conceived of as the test-case scenario to fly a drone for surveillance and monitoring applications to attain the optimum results.",

      "abstract": "Drone deployment has become crucial in a variety of applications, including solutions to traffic issues in metropolitan areas and highways. On the other hand, data collected via drones suffers from several problems, including a wide range of object scales, angle variations, truncation, and occlusion. To process and manipulate visual data from the drones, a variety of image processing algorithms have been employed, each with a distinct aim. Additionally, recent breakthroughs in the field of Artificial Intelligence, particularly deep learning, have attracted broad interest and are being applied to many domains in the framework of smart cities, including road traffic monitoring. The purpose of this study is to conduct a systematic review of drone-based traffic monitoring systems from a deep learning perspective. This work focuses on vehicle detection, tracking, and counting, since they are fundamental building blocks towards founding solutions for traffic congestion, flow rate and vehicle speed estimation. Additionally, drone-based datasets are examined, which face issues and problems caused by the diversity of features inherent of drone devices. The review analysis presented in this work summarizes the literature solutions provided and deployed so far and discusses future research trends in establishing a comprehensive traffic monitoring system in support of the development of smart cities.",

In the context of smart cities and intelligent transportation systems, Structure Health Monitoring (SHM) has gained increasing attention lately, due to the critical conditions of specific civil infrastructures, which led to unfortunate accidents. In this connection, we propose a low-cost, versatile and self-sustaining platform based on the Narrow Band-IoT (NB-IoT) technology aimed at efficiently and continuously monitoring the conditions of critical civil structures. We also provide both lab and in-site experimental tests comparing the performance obtained with our prototype with respect to professional monitoring equipment. Results show a winning trade-off between performance and unquestionable advantages in deployment, use, maintenance and costs.",

      "abstract": "Remotely piloted vehicles have become more and more popular in recent years due to their increased availability on the market. In general, drones can represent a threat for public safety due to their potential misuse. This motivation gives rise to the need of devising specific methods and techniques to monitor sensitive areas, in order to deploy effective drone surveillance systems. These systems are designed to detect nearby undesired targets, and to neutralize impending threats. One of the main tasks involved in this scenarios is target localization, which can be performed with different approaches. In particular, in this article we carry out a study on the main literature works related to the framework of wireless target localization based on RF and WiFi techniques, providing a thorough analysis on the perspective of their deployment in drone surveillance applications.",

      "abstract": "The leading trends in the framework of the Internet of Things are driving the research community to provide smart systems and solutions aimed at revolutionizing medical sciences and healthcare. One of the major opportunities offered by IoT lies in the ubiquitous connectivity, thus enabling smart services such as remote patient monitoring, in-home therapy/rehabilitation, and assisted living platforms. In this paper we present a prototype of wearable smart glasses able to monitor the Eye Blinks (EBs) through ElectroOculoGram (EOG) signal in a transparent way with respect to the final user. We propose a novel pre-filtering scheme to reduce EOG noise along with an analytical derivation of a matched filter to detect and count EBs. We have carried out an in-depth experimental campaign in order to validate the robustness of our approach with respect to the main solutions available in the literature. Furthermore, we have compared the performances obtained with out wearable prototype versus the results achievable with professional medical equipments. Results show that our solution is able to achieve very high accuracy in EB detection, obtaining comparable performance with respect to professional medical desktop equipment, with the additional benefit of portability, comfort and easiness of use for the patients.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, have become dominant recently in all fields including military, commercial, and other multiapplications, such as agriculture, search and rescue, infrastructures monitoring, and surveillance, especially for safety and security purposes. On one hand, deployment of UAVs has facilitated end-users and, on the other hand, this enormous increase in the usage of UAVs has raised many concerns with regard to security, harm, threats, and privacy issues by different agencies, governments, private organizations even by people in their residencies, which has stimulated and motivated many researchers toward the designing of anti-drone systems in order to be secure from such risks. The main objective of this chapter is to provide a comprehensive survey concerning the work carried out in the designing of an anti-drone system for detection, localization, and tracking using Radio Frequency (RF-) and WiFi-based techniques. In the category of drone detection, drone identification, and classification are also being explored. In more detail, this chapter will highlight the key factors of the surveyed techniques and the characteristics of such systems to deploy them, practically. Indeed, current studies provide systematic ways to understand the procedures, methods, tools, and techniques, as well as experimental setups, which have been carried out for the implementation of drone-surveillance systems. A comparison of the performance, found in the literature, of the designed systems in this field is presented and analyzed. Finally, open challenges, possible future research trends, and direction are highlighted in the context of drone detection, localization, and tracking systems. The presented survey chapter is aimed at providing a guide for the research community as it could be an ignition to work further with specific direction so making these crucial systems versatile and ready to be deployed practically to meet their potential market demand.",

Given the extreme diffusion of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), the demand for a solution to early detect neurological symptoms of such diseases strongly arose. According to the medical literature, such early detection can be obtained through the correlation between PD and AD and some external symptoms: the Essential Tremor (ET) and the number of Eye Blinks (EBs). In this paper, which can be considered as an extended version of [1], we present a prototype of wearable smart glasses able to detect the presence of ET of the head and to count the number of EBs at the same time, in a transparent way with respect to the final user. Numerical results demonstrate the reliability of the proposed approach: the proposed algorithms are able to i) correctly recognize the ET with an overall accuracy above 97% and ii) count the number of EBs with an overall error around 9%.",

      "abstract": "Place recognition and user positioning methods are becoming trending topics among the research community thanks to the need of providing cutting-edge solutions to enable innovative and efficient Location-Based Services (LBS) and applications. However, the mobile framework suffers from typical constraints on energy and computational capabilities due to the inherent characteristics of wireless mobile devices. For this reason, in order to be suitable for deploying in such framework, a place recognition algorithm should be thrifty in terms of resource consumption. In this paper we consider six different WiFi-based outdoor positioning approaches and we analytically derive an upper-bound for their computational burden in terms of number of FLoating-point OPerations (FLOPs).",

      "abstract": "This article describes a microwave tomographic approach for the quantitative imaging of brain stroke inside the human head. For the acquisition of the scattered-field information, a prototype of multistatic system is adopted. An array of custom antennas is placed in contact with the head, and a switching matrix is used to measure the scattering parameters for each pair of probes. The collected data are processed by an inversion method based on a variable-exponent Lebesgue-space regularization technique, whose outcome is a map of dielectric properties of a slice of the head. With respect to previous approaches, this kind of inversion procedure performs an adaptive update of the Lebesgue-space exponents on the basis of the results at each inexact-Newton iteration and exploits stepped frequency data. This allows for an automatic setting of the regularization level, which becomes variable and target-dependent inside the whole investigation domain. The proposed approach is validated by means of FDTD synthetic simulations with a realistic 3-D forward scattering model of the human head, as well as by using real experimental cylindrical test phantoms filled with saline and glycerin/water mixtures.",

      "abstract": "Thanks to the great proliferation of mobile devices within the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, Smart Buildings and Smart Cities are becoming hot topics. In such smart environments, user localization plays a central role. More specifically, Point-of-Interest (POI) recognition is one of the most attractive Location-Based-Service (LBS) applications. This paper provides computational complexity upper bounds for fingerprint-based POI recognition algorithms. We have considered five algorithms reported in a former work: LRACI and its extended variant ELRACI, BeaconPrint, PlaceSense, SensLoc and SAPFI. For each of them a close-form of their computational complexity has been derived, both for the training and the recognition phase. The results obtained in this works allow a comprehensive and fair comparison of some of the most well-known POI recognition algorithms.",

      "abstract": "Information related to recognizing the place in which a user is has become crucial to deliver efficient and tailored Location-Based Services (LBSs). Though plenty of solutions exist for recognizing indoor places, almost no idea is present in the literature for recognizing big outdoor places without the GPS employment. Though these solutions assure great accuracy they also have a strong request in terms of energy necessary to achieve such result. This paper proposes a Place of Interest (POI) recognition algorithm called Enhanced-LRACI. It is an evolution of LRACI (Location Recognition Algorithm for automatic Check-In applications), a former work reported in [1]. E-LRACI aims at recognizing big outdoor places only by using WiFi Access Points (APs) over mobile devices (smartphones). The main contributions of this work are: i) it solves the problem of big outdoor POI recognition without using GPS by leveraging on the concept of spot, ii) it proposes a novel fingerprint (FP) algorithm and iii) it outperforms the results obtained by other reference works in terms of recognition accuracy. Performance investigation reported in this paper, carried out on real data acquired over mobile devices (Android smartphones), shows that our proposal is able to correctly recognize big outdoor POIs in 95% of the cases whereas other state of the art papers do not exceed 89%.",

      "abstract": "The growing interest in concepts such as smart cities and smart mobility is giving more and more importance to place of interest (POI) information, which proves to be crucial in providing efficient and tailored location-based services (LBSs). Though plenty of solutions exist for recognizing indoor places, the literature lacks of approaches aimed at recognizing big outdoor places without the GPS employment. Even if GPS-based solutions assure great accuracy, they have a strong request in terms of energy necessary to achieve such result. As a consequence, if LBSs are thought on the move (e.g., mobile devices such as smartphones are used) energy consumption is a key constraint. This paper proposes a POI recognition algorithm called enhanced location recognition algorithm for automatic check-in applications (E-LRACI). It is an evolution of LRACI (Location Recognition Algorithm for automatic Check-In applications, originally reported in [I. Bisio, F. Lavagetto, M. Marchese, and A. Sciarrone, ''GPS/HPS-andwifi fingerprint-based location recognition for check-in applications over smartphones in cloud-based LBSS,'' IEEE Transactions on Multimedia, vol. 15, no. 4, pp. 858-869, Jun. 2013]) which aims at recognizing big outdoor places by only exploiting radio beacons emitted by WiFi access points. In terms of contributions, this paper first, proposes a novel fingerprint algorithm; second, solves the problem of big outdoor POI recognition without using GPS by leveraging the concept of spot; and third, compares the results obtained by E-LRACI and other reference works both in terms of recognition accuracy and computational complexity. The obtained numerical results, carried out on real data (acquired with Android-based smartphones), prove that E-LRACI provides the best results since it is able to guarantee the highest accuracy (95% versus, at most, 89%) at a lowest computational complexity with respect to the existing POI recognition algorithms.",

      "abstract": "In the latest years, the popularity of commercial drones has grown rapidly due to their cheaper costs and great availability on the market. The great diffusion of remotely piloted devices unfortunately leads to several security and safety concerns that need to be tackled. In this paper, we consider a fingerprint-based drone detection approach relying on the analysis of WiFi traffic features to identify the presence of unauthorized devices. In particular, we study the statistical distribution of the features composing the fingerprint vector, and we propose an adversarial approach to drone detection in order to invalidate the reliability of the surveillance system, by introducing fake ad-hoc traffic features. Results show that our novel approach is able to deceive the drone detection system through the introduction of flows belonging to arbitrary traffic classes. Also, the proposed adversarial method provides the expected significant impact on the performance of the system, actually reducing the recognition accuracy to about 50%.",

      "abstract": "The telecommunication infrastructure in emergency scenarios is necessarily composed of heterogeneous radio/mobile portions. Mobile Nodes (MNs) equipped with multiple network interfaces can assure continuous communications when different Radio Access Networks (RANs) that employ different Radio Access Technologies (RATs) are available. In this context, the paper proposes the definition of a Decision Maker (DM), within the protocol stack of the MN, in charge of performing network selections and handover decisions. The DM has been designed to optimize one or more performance metrics and it is based on Multiattribute Decision Making (MADM) methods. Among several MADM techniques considered, taken from the literature, the work is then focused on the TOPSIS approach, which allows introducing some improvements aimed at reducing the computational burden needed to select the RAT to be employed. The enhanced method is called Dynamic-TOPSIS (D-TOPSIS). Finally, the numerical results, obtained through a large simulative campaign and aimed at comparing the performance and the running time of the D-TOPSIS, the TOPSIS, and the algorithms found in the literature, are reported and discussed.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, Internet of Things (IoT) devices can collect a large amount of data and infer the context they are operating in. One of the most pervasive IoT device is the smartphone. Among the plethora of sensors that such device has, microphone is probably the most versatile. It can be used to infer information about the context by acquiring the environmental sound. In this paper, we propose an active ultrasonic-based method able to sense context information. The approach is based on the emission of periodic ultrasonic impulses, called pings, whose echoes are continuously acquired to extract a proper set of features. Using a classifier the context information is then retrieved. Two applications are presented: 1) an indoor/outdoor detector and 2) an earphone wearing state detector. In both cases a smartphone is the employed device. The former senses if the smartphone is in an indoor or outdoor environment while the latter detects if a user is wearing or not his earphones. The obtained results are encouraging for both the solutions that have been stressed in different working conditions and employed within proper application frameworks.",

      "abstract": "IPID5180477. Several research teams around the world are currently involved in developing imaging systems, with different specific final objectives and considered modalities. Although excellent results have been reported in the scientific literature (see, for example, [1], [2], and the references therein), there are theoretical and practical difficulties that still make these techniques a challenge. The former are related to the processing of data (limited amount of information, low signal-to-noise ratios, ill-posedness, etc.), whereas the latter are essentially related to the effective realization and use of the system. In this paper, we discuss some recent results related to a tomographic system which is currently under development. In particular, a new reconstruction procedure based on a conjugate gradient approach, directly implemented in the framework of the L p Banach spaces, is presented. This inversion procedure, preliminary discussed in [3], seems to be particularly suitable for obtaining a regularized solution of the inverse scattering problem, with less artefacts and noise (on the final image) due to a reduction of the usually encountered over-smoothing effects. The effectiveness of the approach is evaluated, even with three-dimensional data, by means of numerical simulations involving an accurate model of the human head.",

      "abstract": "The importance of robust audio speech processing has rapidly increased in the latest years, as the number of smart and connected devices is growing. This effect is strongly related to the Internet of things framework, introducing concepts such as connected vehicles and future smart cities. Context-Aware applications are fundamental in this evolving environment, enabling smart and custom-Tailored services for a variety of users. The use of on-board speaker recognition (SR) systems can play a key role in enhancing the customization of in-vehicle applications, by identifying the actual users and personalizing services based on their identity. Driven by this motivation, in this paper we present a performance study of an SR system, designed to face typical challenging conditions of an in-vehicle environment. We propose the design of a robust speaker identification algorithm embedding a smart preprocessing method based on voice activity detection, which can effectively reduce the influence of noise and distance on classification. Results show that our solution is able to efficiently improve the correct classification rate, even in the case of distant audio acquisition and in a variety of noisy environments.",

Important examples of LBS concerns indoor environments in which GPS technology cannot be used. On the other hand, the great diffusion of pervasive Mobile Devices (MDs) as smartphones and tablets has enabled many positioning techniques, such as WiFi FingerPrinting (FP), that exploits all the MD's embedded sensors. This paper proposes and investigates the performance of a method exploiting a WiFi FP algorithm for indoor localization fed with information from the barometer to estimate the floor in which the MD is located. Our results, carried out in indoor areas at the University of Genoa (UniGE) and at the University of Bologna (UniBO), show that when more than 5 Access Points (APs) are used the proposed 3D positioning system is able to accurately localize the user with an error below 2 and 1.2 and meters for the UniBO and UniGE case, respectively.",

With the introduction of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, the knowledge of user's location has become crucial information to deliver the efficient and tailored Location Based Services (LBS), especially in indoor environments. In this paper we propose an AP (Access Point)-centred indoor positioning system that overcomes common limitations presented in conventional positioning systems, such as an excessive involvement of Mobile Devices (MDs). Our work merges ideas originally proposed in [1] and [2] to build an efficient, accurate and smart Probabilistic-FingerPrint (P-FP) algorithm that avoids the MD involvement and considers the signal strength measurements as a random variable in the positioning process. Numerical results, obtained in a real-world deployment, show better performance on positioning accuracy, energy consumption and latency with respect to the MD-based architecture.",

      "abstract": "This article surveys the concept of Industry 4.0 (I4.0), which has become more and more pervasive in recent years thanks to the great effort that factories, researchers, and organizations are putting into its definition and development. We present the IoT as the key I4.0 technology since it enables faster and more efficient production and management processes, leveraging the flexibility of smart, ubiquitous, connected devices. In particular, we discuss the role of the I4.0 revolution in driving the diffusion of smart products and services, by focusing on ambient intelligence and context awareness in IoT and on the so-called DIKW hierarchy. Finally, to demonstrate the practical impact of this emerging framework, we show, as practical examples, three typical I4.0 applications in the smart factory, smart home, and smart health scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Mobile satellite services are extremely important when continuity of service is requested while the user is moving over a wide area. A notable example is represented by live TV services, or more in general by the Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Services (MBMSs) and its evolved version enhanced MBMS. In this paper, we present the combined use of multicast resource allocation schemes based on subgrouping and application layer joint coding to enhance the performance of live video streaming in mobile satellite systems. The reference architecture foresees a satellite-based long term evolution transmission using orthogonal frequency division multiple access in the forward link. The results show that the combined use of multicast subgrouping resource allocation and application layer joint coding allows high-throughput transmissions with satisfactory user quality of experience of the received video over different satellite channel propagation environments.",

      "abstract": "Amateur drones are enjoying great popularity in recent years due to the wide commercial diffusion of small, rather low-cost devices. More and more user-friendly, easy-to-pilot aerial and terrestrial drones are available off the shelf, and people can even remotely pilot them using their smartphones. This situation brings up the problem of keeping unauthorized drones away from private or sensitive areas, where they can represent a personal or public threat. With this motivation, after a survey of the existing solutions, we propose a WiFi-based approach aimed at detecting nearby aerial or terrestrial devices by performing statistical fingerprint analysis on wireless traffic. This novel detection technique, tested in a variety of real-life scenarios, proved able to efficiently detect and identify intruder drones in all the considered experimental setups, making it a promising unmanned aerial vehicle detection approach in the framework of amateur drone surveillance.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, a numerical study devoted to evaluate the application of a microwave imaging method for brain stroke detection is described. First of all, suitable operating conditions for the imaging system are defined by solving the forward electromagnetic scattering problem with respect to simplified configurations and analyzing the interactions between an illuminating electromagnetic wave at microwave frequencies and the biological tissues inside the head. Then, preliminary inversion results are obtained by applying an imaging procedure based on an iterative Gauss-Newton scheme to a realistic model of the human head. The proposed imaging algorithm is able to deal with the nonlinear and ill-posed problem associated to the integral equations describing the inverse scattering problem. The aim of the inversion procedure is related to the determination of the presence of a hemorrhagic brain stroke by retrieving the distributions of the dielectric parameters of the human tissues inside a slice of the head model.",

      "abstract": "The increasing popularity of low-cost aerial vehicles that can be remotely piloted by amateurs, is giving rise to a number of issues related to public safety and privacy. At the same time, the need for surveillance methods able to detect the presence of unauthorized drones meets the ubiquitous connectivity and pervasive technology typical of the big data era. This dualism drives the research community towards the design of monitoring systems able to integrate machine learning methods and data mining techniques in this evolving environment. In this framework, we consider a WiFi based approach aimed at detecting nearby unmanned aerial vehicles, by performing statistical fingerprint analysis on wireless traffic. We study the inherent vulnerabilities of the considered method through real-life experimental tests by setting up specific attack scenarios, and we devise and test a solution in order to improve the efficiency of the proposed technique in the presence of malicious countermeasures. Results show that the proposed improved detection technique is indeed robust to stealth attacks, and it is able to achieve very good recognition performance in different real-life testing scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Location Fingerprinting (LF) is a promising localization technique that enables many commercial and emergency Location-Based Services (LBS). The idea of this paper is two- folded. First, a Gaussian Process (GP) is used during the training (offline) phase of an indoor positioning algorithm to generate the fingerprint database, reducing the expensive labor of acquiring and maintaining the fingerprint database significantly. Furthermore, during the positioning (online) phase, a Smart algorithm (already proposed in [1]) is used for reducing the computation effort for positioning calculation. We call our idea Smart<sup>2</sup> since it enhances the advantages of the base Smart approach. Specifically, Smart<sup>2</sup> reduces the labor during the offline phase by trading it with a small positioning error and, at the same time, it limits the energy consumption in the online phase without incurring in any additional accuracy detriment.",

      "abstract": "Rehabilitation and elderly monitoring for active aging can benefit from Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities in particular for in-home treatments. In this paper, we consider two functions useful for such treatments: 1) activity recognition (AR) and 2) movement recognition (MR). The former is aimed at detecting if a patient is idle, still, walking, running, going up/down the stairs, or cycling; the latter individuates specific movements often required for physical rehabilitation, such as arm circles, arm presses, arm twist, curls, seaweed, and shoulder rolls. Smartphones are the reference platforms being equipped with an accelerometer sensor and elements of the IoT. The work surveys and compares accelerometer signals classification methods to enable IoT for the aforementioned functions. The considered methods are support vector machines (SVMs), decision trees, and dynamic time warping. A comparison of the methods has been proposed to highlight their performance: all the techniques have good recognition accuracies and, among them, the SVM-based approaches show an accuracy above 90% in the case of AR and above 99% in the case of MR.",

      "abstract": "The exponential increase in the number and types of mobile devices, along with their ever-growing sets of capabilities, have enabled the development of new architectures that aim to harness such heterogeneity. Transient clouds are examples of mobile clouds, which are created on-the-fly by the devices present in an environment to share their physical resources (e.g. CPU, memory and network) and would disappear as the nodes leave the network. They enable a device to go beyond its own physical limitations through utilising the capabilities offered by nearby devices over an ad hoc network. This idea exploits the device-to-device (D2D) communications paradigm, which allows two nearby devices to communicate with each other in the licenced cellular bandwidth without a base station involved. In this paper, we present a transient context-aware cloud (TCAC) paradigm based on the assumption that the nodes of the network care more about providing/learning higher level functionalities rather than lower level capabilities in D2D scenario. The proposed architecture, realised by using a WiFi Direct, can be portable through any paradigm, which exploits the D2D communications, so opening the doors to forthcoming 5G scenarios. We present a prototype implementation of our architecture over Android smartphones connected via WiFi Direct along with the performance metrics (power/energy consumption and accuracy) to show the benefits of TCAC. A theoretical and analytical model for the energy consumption related to a device within the TCAC is provided as well. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

      "abstract": "The treatments for brain stroke are strongly timedependent. The medical literature highlights the need of a quick diagnosis in order to guarantee the most effective therapy. An important target for strokes is trying to achieve a Door-to-Needle (DTN) time of less than 60 minutes, which is called Golden Hour [1]. This paper proposes a mobile Smart Helmet (SH) thought to be worn by a patient when the first aid medical team arrives and the aim is to efficiently recognize and detect a brain stroke, on site. While similar solutions in the literature employ the (usually computationally heavy) electromagnetic field inversion problem and image analysis, the proposal of this paper is an NN-based SH. It uses signal analysis to recognize the presence of a stroke with a limited computational burden. In the reported preliminary experiments, carried out via simulations, we have employed a MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) model that implements a 4-layer NN. Numerical results show that proposed signal analysis, applied to a single brain model, is able to efficiently detect the stroke presence with an accuracy around 90%.",

      "abstract": "Indoor navigation and localization are becoming fundamental services nowadays. WiFi-based solutions such as FingerPrinting (FP) are the most widely adopted techniques for positioning and provide better results if compared to other approaches. They require to compare WiFi Received Signal Strength (RSS) with an pre-computed radio map called fingerprint. The recently proposed Smart Probabilistic FingerPrinting (P-FP) algorithm reduces the computational complexity of the traditional FP approach without any accuracy detriment. On the other hand, fog computing has emerged as a new promising paradigm in the recent years, which extends traditional mobile cloud computing capabilities towards the edge of the network and enables location-Aware services. In this paper we propose to offload Smart P-FP computation over a fog platform exploiting a novel distributed algorithm. Performance evaluation validates the effectiveness of the proposed approach with the analysis of: i) the amount of power saved and ii) the efficiency of candidate selection process for offloading. Having 2 or more devices in the vicinity contributing to the computation makes offloading beneficial from a power standpoint. The offloading effectiveness increases with the number of devices willing to contribute and the amount of data to be transferred. Power savings can be as high as 80% if compared with local computation.",

This paper presents an approach to speed-up the p(o|l) computation without any approximation. The consequent positioning scheme is called Smart P-FP. The comparison between Traditional (without any p(o|l) acceleration) and Smart P-FP is performed over different smartphones. The saved energy is about 90% for a large number of Access Points (APs) but is significant even with few APs: more than 86% with 3 APs.

The platform helps physicians to monitor the patients remotely so avoiding hospitalization therapies that can be stressful. In more detail, the work is focused on the Movement Recognition (MR) functionality of the aforementioned platform. It compares algorithms, which process the signal provided by the embedded accelerometer sensor of the smartphone, able to recognize if a patient had performed the movements requested by the physicians. The provided performance comparison of different MR techniques shows that Support Vector Machine-based approaches have very good accuracy (up to 99.3%), thus making the in-home physical therapy reliable.",

Specifically, we refer to the active warden problem, a process which aims at disrupting the covert communications that are possibly taking place within host media. Although this has been extensively studied in the literature, typical state of the art approaches treat the hidden message as a noise-like component, proposing de- noising techniques, lossy compression or noise addition as a countermeasure. In this paper we present novel approach called Lesser Components Distortion (LCD) that aims at disrupting the covert communication while minimizing distortion on the host medium. Although stemming from insights gained from notable works in the spread spectrum steganography field, we prove through extensive testing that it shows remarkable effectiveness against steganographic techniques in general, compared to common attacks.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, an Android SPEech proCessing plaTform as smaRtphone Application (SPECTRA) is presented. Such application, developed by the authors, has three main functions: i) Gender Recognition (GR), ii) Speaker Recognition (SR) and iii) Language Recognition (LR). All these recognition functions are performed simultaneously by using unsupervised Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. An innovative point of this paper lies in the automatic re-training of the employed SVMs which are able to dynamically update themselves when a (new) audio from a (new) speaker is provided. This allow to build more robust classifiers, which results in better recognition performances. In terms of accuracy, the GR reaches about 98% of correct classifications, SR performs around 80% while LR shows an accuracy of about 74%.",

The core functions of the architecture are performed by two Android applications: the Asset Proximity Locator (APL) and the Wandering Objects Location Finder (WOLF). The key feature of the asset tracking function is the ability to maximize smartphone battery lifetime by switching on and off the GPS unit, thus guaranteeing that the smartphone can be used for an entire working shift.

      "abstract": "Heart failure is a chronic disease that alternates intense and weak phases and requires repeated and frequent hospital treatments. The use of automatic instruments for a remote and ubiquitous monitoring of biological parameters relevant to heart failure pathophysiology offers new perspectives to improve the patients' quality of life and the efficacy of the treatment. The platform described in this paper represents an implementation of an automatic remote monitoring tool where smartphones play a crucial role. They are not employed just to communicate through traditional client-server applications and they are not only the hub of information sent by sensors, but they also act as intelligent processors and autonomous sensors of the patients' motion through a high-accuracy activity recognition algorithm. The proposed platform combines the evolution of health systems and the consequent needs of modern telemedicine with the current context-aware capability of recent smartphones, obtained by implementing specific algorithmic solutions, and with the anything, anytime, and anywhere communication capability of the pervasive communications paradigm. Performance evaluation focuses on the accuracy of the activity recognition estimation, on its applicability to real life, and on the data exchange between smartphones and medical server, allowing to envisage the potential of the designed platform.",

      "abstract": "The exponential increase in the number and types of mobile devices, along with their ever-growing sets of capabilities, have enabled the development of new architectures that aim to harness such heterogeneity. Transient Clouds (TCs) are examples of mobile clouds which are created on-the-fly by the devices present in an environment to share their physical resources (e.g., CPU, memory, network) and would disappear as the nodes leave the network. They enable a device to go beyond its own physical limitations through utilizing the capabilities offered by nearby devices over an ad-hoc network. In this paper we present a Transient Context-Aware Cloud (TCAC) in which the nodes of the network care more about providing/learning higher level functionalities rather than lower level capabilities. We make the case for such an architecture in scenarios where it is not feasible for all the nodes to compute the context due to privacy, energy, and delay constraints rather than an unreachable network.We present a prototype implementation of our architecture over Android smartphones connected via WiFi along with the performance metrics (power/energy consumption and accuracy)to show the benefits of context awareness in TCs.",

      "abstract": "Recently, patients suffering from a set of physical and mental limitations, called co-morbidities, are often treated at home. In this environment, modern communication systems represent a great support to implement Ambient Assisted Living platforms aimed at monitoring patients at home because they enable the seamless integration of heterogeneous sensing units, medical devices, and ubiquitous access to data. This article describes a specific smartphone-centric architecture where smartphones are employed not only as hubs of the health information but also as sensing, processing, and transmitting devices. Smartphones have both short-range (Bluetooth and WiFi employed for local information exchange) and long-range (GPRS, 3G/4G, and WiFi employed as Internet access) communication capabilities; information processing capabilities offered by modern platforms often equipped with different CPUs and with flexible and efficient software; and sensing capabilities implemented through sensors embedded into smartphones such as GPS receivers, accelerometers, microphones, and radio interfaces or through external sensors added to smartphones by cables or connected through local radio interfaces. The specific case of co-morbidities considered in this article implies the necessity to acquire a heterogeneous set of data from patients and from their environment. For this reason this article highlights the information processing capabilities of the introduced smartphone-centric platform. Audio, localization, and movement information processing have been evidenced as well as the specific implementations of these capabilities and their performance.",

Thanks to the wide availability of electromagnetic sources deployed for various applications (e.g., WiFi), nowadays it is possible to perform this task by using low-cost mobile devices, such as smartphones. To this end, in order to achieve high positioning accuracy and reduce the computational resources used in the position estimation, fingerprinting approaches are usually employed. However, in this case, a time-consuming training phase, where a great number of measurements must be performed, is needed. In this letter, a novel approach, where the training data are obtained by means of finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations of the electromagnetic propagation in the considered scenario, is presented. The performances of the method are assessed by means of experimental results in a real scenario. © 2002-2011 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Telemedicine applications provide healthcare services through communications technologies overcoming the geographical separation between patients and caregivers. These services can be provided via wireless devices, such as smart-phones with dedicated applications. An interesting application concerns the so-called situation awareness algorithms and, in particular, the Activity Recognition (AR) aimed at tracking the physical activity (or movements) of patients that need a constant monitoring of their medical conditions. This work takes as reference an architecture applicable, but not limited to, patients suffering from Heart Failure (HF) and presents a performance comparison between AR approaches based on the accelerometer signal captured through the patients' smartphones. In more detail, the considered AR techniques apply two different classifiers used to decide the patients movements: a J48 decision tree and a Support Vector Machine (SVM). For each classifier, three different features sets, characterizing the accelerometer signal, have been employed. The performance are evaluated both in terms of accuracy-related metrics and time needed by each classifiers to perform the decision. The results show that SVM provides the best accuracy while the J48 requires less classification time.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes a system that allows recognizing a person's emotional state starting from audio signal registrations. The provided solution is aimed at improving the interaction among humans and computers, thus allowing effective human-computer intelligent interaction. The system is able to recognize six emotions (anger, boredom, disgust, fear, happiness, and sadness) and the neutral state. This set of emotional states is widely used for emotion recognition purposes. It also distinguishes a single emotion versus all the other possible ones, as proven in the proposed numerical results. The system is composed of two subsystems: 1) gender recognition (GR) and 2) emotion recognition (ER). The experimental analysis shows the performance in terms of accuracy of the proposed ER system. The results highlight that the a priori knowledge of the speaker's gender allows a performance increase. The obtained results show also that the features selection adoption assures a satisfying recognition rate and allows reducing the employed features. Future developments of the proposed solution may include the implementation of this system over mobile devices such as smartphones.",

The work aims at highlighting the positioning accuracy, the robustness and the consistency of the method by testing it over two different smartphone platforms (i.e., Nokia N95 and Samsung Galaxy S II), within a given area. In more detail, three different variants of the probabilistic approach have been tested: Nearest Neighbor (NN), K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) and K Weighted-Nearest Neighbor (KW-NN). Numerical experiments, carried out in an area of around 80 [m<sup>2</sup>], have shown that the probabilistic fingerprint provides good position accuracy (less than 1.20 [m] of error) for both devices and also robustness when the signal strength acquisitions are reduced. Finally, the similarity of results provided by the two smartphones leads to assert that the probabilistic approach is also consistent with respect to the device employed in the experiments. © 2013 Society for Modeling & Simulation International.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes a new location recognition algorithm for automatic check-in applications (LRACI), suited to be implemented within Smartphones, integrated in the Cloud platform and representing a service for Cloud end users. The algorithm, the performance of which is independent of the employed device, uses both global and hybrid positioning systems (GPS/HPS) and, in an opportunistic way, the presence of Wi-Fi access points (APs), through a new definition of Wi-Fi FingerPrint (FP), which is proposed in this paper. This FP definition considers the order relation among the received signal strength (RSS) rather than the absolute values. This is one of the main contributions of this paper. LRACI is designed to be employed where traditional approaches, usually based only on GPS/HPS, fail, and is aimed at finding user location, with a room-level resolution, in order to estimate the overall time spent in the location, called Permanence, instead of the simple presence. LRACI allows automatic check-in in a given location only if the users' Permanence is larger than a minimum amount of time, called Stay Length (SL), and may be exploited in the Cloud. For example, if many people check-in in a particular location (e.g., a supermarket or a post office), it means that the location is crowded. Using LRACI-based data, collected by smartphones in the Cloud and made available in the Cloud itself, end users can manage their daily activities (e.g., buying food or paying a bill) in a more efficient way. The proposal, practically implemented over Android operating system-based Smartphones, has been extensively tested. Experimental results have shown a location recognition accuracy of about 90%, opening the door to real LRACI employments. In this sense, a preliminary study of its application in the Cloud, obtained through simulation, has been provided to highlight the advantages of the LRACI features. © 1999-2012 IEEE.",

The presented solution does not apply any kind of approximation with respect to the traditional approach, so avoiding accuracy detriment. The idea is to factoring out the parts of the probabilistic fingerprint formulae that can be computed a-priori, so reducing the computational burden of the positioning process.

On the other hand, the technological evolution of Smartphones, combined with their increasing diffusion, gives mobile network providers the opportunity to offer real-time services based on captured real world knowledge and events. This paper presents a Smartphone-based Activity Recognition (AR) method based on decision tree classification of accelerometer signals to classify the user's activity as Sitting, Standing, Walking or Running. The main contribution of the work is a method employing a novel windowing technique which reduces the rate of accelerometer readings while maintaining high recognition accuracy by combining two single-classification weighting policies. The proposed method has been implemented on Android OS smartphones and experimental tests have produced satisfying results.
