      "abstract": "In the area of biomedical diagnostics, microwave imaging techniques have been recently proposed for performing brain stroke detection and monitoring. Indeed, theoretically, these techniques make it possible to meet the timeliness requirements of such a diagnosis with portable systems. Moreover, relying on the use of microwaves, they are noninvasive and allow continuous monitoring of critical patients. In this paper, the microwave imaging problem is solved by exploiting multifrequency data by an inexact-Newton method formulated in the framework of non-constant exponent Lebesgue spaces. First, the method is numerically validated with three-dimensional head models affected by anatomically-realistic strokes. Then, a further assessment through experimental data obtained with a cylindrical phantom is conducted. A quite accurate reconstruction of the variations of dielectric properties inside the patient’s head due to the insurgence of stroke is obtained in both numerical and experimental cases, showing the potentiality of the proposed approach.",

In the context of microwave-based diagnostic techniques, a quantitative imaging method is proposed here to obtain two-dimensional reconstructions of the internal dielectric properties of trunks, starting from scattered-field measurements. The method, which aims at solving a nonlinear and ill-posed inverse problem, combines a mild data-driven approach with an inexact-Newton scheme. In particular, the goal of the data-driven methodology, which is adopted here for the first time in this application, is to introduce prior information about the trunk structure, helping the reconstruction process.

      "abstract": "Quantitative inversion of GPR data opens the door to precise characterization of underground environments. However, in order to make the inverse scattering problem solution easier from a computational viewpoint, simplifying assumptions are often applied, i.e., two-dimensional approximations or the consideration of idealized field probes and electromagnetic sources. These assumptions usually produce modeling errors, which can degrade the dielectric reconstruction results considerably. In this article, a processing step based on long short-term memory cells is proposed for the first time to correct the modeling error in a multiantenna GPR setting. In particular, time-domain GPR data are fed into a neural network trained with couples of finite-difference time-domain simulations, where a set of sample targets are simulated in both realistic and idealized configurations. Once trained, the neural network outputs an approximation of multiantenna GPR data as they are collected by an ideal two-dimensional measurement setup. The inversion of the processed data is then accomplished by means of a regularizing Newton-based nonlinear scheme with variable exponent Lebesgue space formulation. A numerical study has been conducted to assess the capabilities of the proposed inversion methodology. The results indicate the possibility of effectively compensating for modeling error in the considered test cases.",

In particular, the developed technique relies upon the use of a Newton-type inversion scheme in variable-exponent Lebesgue spaces, which has been modified by including a data-driven operator to enforce the available a-priori information about the class of targets to be investigated. In this way, the performance of the method is improved, and the problems related to the possible convergence to local minima are mitigated. The effectiveness of the approach has been evaluated through numerical simulations involving the detection of defects inside (partially) known objects, showing good results.",

      "abstract": "The role of microwaves in the early diagnosis of brain stroke is rapidly emerging. Several systems have been developed, and some of them are already under clinical evaluation. However, the quantitative imaging of the dielectric properties of the head is an extremely challenging task, and a continuous improvement in inversion algorithms is necessary to address the clinical needs. This paper proposes a mild datadriven strategy to solve the inverse scattering problem for microwave brain stroke characterization. The approach aims at joining the benefits of data-driven inversion and a Newtonbased solution procedure. Through a set of numerical simulations, promising dielectric reconstructions of cross sections of healthy and stroke-affected heads are obtained.",

      "abstract": "Brain stroke is a pathology affecting a significant number of people worldwide. A fast diagnosis is required to administer the correct therapy and frequent monitoring is usually necessary during follow-up. Microwave imaging represents a promising technology able to address such needs and that may complement gold-standard systems. In this framework, a novel Lebesgue-space approach for microwave imaging of stroke is presented in this paper. The developed method combines an inexact-Newton inversion technique in variable-exponent Lebesgue spaces with a data-driven regularization term. In this way, a-priori information about the configuration under test, e.g., the head structure, can be exploited and the convergence of the method can be enhanced. The method is preliminarily evaluated by means of numerical simulations involving realistic head phantoms. The obtained results confirm that the developed approach allows identifying and characterizing the stroke with a good accuracy.",

Timely and adequate treatments play a fundamental role since radically different therapies are required for ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, and a misdiagnosis can cause further damage. In this scenario, microwave imaging is emerging as a powerful tool for non-invasive diagnostics [1]. However, it requires the solution of a problem that is inherently non-linear and ill-posed.

Following a thorough evaluation of the dough dielectric properties, a suitable antenna layout has been selected, pointing out the advantages in the choice of a contactless narrow-band antenna in comparison to wide-band and dual-band ones. The presented simulated results are then validated using a prototype sensor and an ad hoc measurement system to confirm the antenna ability to discriminate among doughs with different water content. In addition, an accurate analysis of possible sources of misinterpretation of the results is presented.",

      "abstract": "Magnetic biomaterials are multifunctional tools currently under investigation as theranostic platforms for biomedical applications. They can be implanted in bone tissue after bone cancer resection to perform local interstitial hyperthermia treatment. Given the requirements of high quality treatment, the hyperthermia therapy should be performed monitoring the system temperature, to avoid hot spots and control the treatment outcome. It is known that the magnetic properties of such implants vary with temperature. It is hypotesized that the treatment dynamic could be monitored using a microwave monitoring system. The variation of the electromagnetic properties of the biological tissues and the magnetic implant during the therapy would result in a different propagation of the microwave signal. This work investigates the feasibility of using microwaves to non-invasively monitor hyperthermia treatments with a simplified monodimensional propagation model. The forward problem is solved to identify the working frequencies, the matching medium properties and study several candidate materials. By using the numerical solutions from nonlinear and multiphysics simulations of the bone tumor hyperthermia treatment using magnetic scaffolds, the microwave signal propagation dynamic is studied. From our feasibility analysis, we found that it is possible to correlate the average tumor temperature with significant (~20 dB) variations in the transmission coefficient during a typical interstitial hyperthermia session using magnetic scaffolds. Our work brings together, for the first time, the electromagnetic material properties, the physio-pathology and physics of the hyperthermia treatment and the microwave propagation problem, thus paving the route for the development of an innovative theranostic system.",

      "abstract": "The treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has changed dramatically with the advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Despite encouraging results, their efficacy remains limited to a subgroup of patients. Circulating immune checkpoints in soluble (s) form and associated with extracellular vesicles (EVs) represent promising markers, especially in ICI-based therapeutic settings. We evaluated the prognostic role of PD-L1 and of two B7 family members (B7-H3, B7-H4), both soluble and EV-associated, in a cohort of advanced NSCLC patients treated with first- (n = 56) or second-line (n = 126) ICIs. In treatment-naïve patients, high baseline concentrations of sPD-L1 (>24.2 pg/mL) were linked to worse survival, whereas high levels of sB7-H3 (>0.5 ng/mL) and sB7-H4 (>63.9 pg/mL) were associated with better outcomes. EV characterization confirmed the presence of EVs positive for PD-L1 and B7-H3, while only a small portion of EVs expressed B7-H4. The comparison between biomarker levels at the baseline and in the first radiological assessment under ICI-based treatment showed a significant decrease in EV-PD-L1 and an increase in EV-B7H3 in patients in the disease response to ICIs. Our study shows that sPD-L1, sB7-H3 and sB7-H4 levels are emerging prognostic markers in patients with advanced NSCLC treated with ICIs and suggests potential EV involvement in the disease response to ICIs.",

The application of such methods to pediatric stroke has never been explored, despite the potential usefulness in many cases. The goal of this work is to start approaching this problem, with a preliminary assessment through numerical simulations. After the development of voxel-based models of stroke-affected child heads, the forward electromagnetic problem has been solved by means of a finite-difference time-domain solver in a three-dimensional configuration. Preliminary numerical reconstructions of the dielectric properties of head tissues have also been carried out by means of a nonlinear inverse-scattering procedure.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, antenna arrays are important tools adopted in a great number of applications including radar, mobile and satellite communication systems, and electromagnetic imaging. Moreover, in these applications, arrays with a high number of elements are ever more requested, which results in a growing possibility of damages in the array. The identification of defective components in array of antennas is really significant due to their applicative use: indeed, faulty detected elements can be fixed, thus avoiding to replace the whole antenna. In this work, a diagnostic technique for planar antenna arrays is presented. This approach enables recovering the eventually defective elements of the antenna under test using far-field data. To this end, an inversion approach established outside the standard context of Hilbertian spaces is used to address an inverse-source problem. A numerical validation concerning simple array antennas has been carried out to study the performances of the approach versus some antenna parameters, e.g., the size of the array.",

The ANN is trained using simulated phantoms, to overcome the limited availability of experimental data. First, a simple configuration with a liquid-filled glass beaker is tested. Then, simplified 3-D-printed models of the human neck are considered. The preliminary findings indicate the possibility of training the network with numerical simulations and testing it against experimental measurements.",

      "abstract": "To date, tumors, the second cause of death worldwide, are a modern medicine plight. The development of rapid, cost-effective and reliable prevention and diagnostics tools is mandatory to support clinicians and ensure patients’ adequate intervention. Pituitary tumors are a class of neoplasm, which calls for suitable and ad hoc diagnostic tools. Recently, microwaves have gained interest as a non-ionizing, non-invasive valuable diagnostic approach for identifying pathologic tissues according to their dielectric properties. This work deals with the preliminary investigation of the feasibility of using microwaves to diagnose pituitary tumors. In particular, it focuses on benign tumors of the adenohypophysis, e.g., the pituitary adenomas. It is assumed to access the region of interest of the pituitary region by following a trans-sphenoidal approach. The problem was modeled by developing an equivalent transmission line model of the multi-layered, lossy tissues (front bone of sphenoid sinuses, air in the sinuses, posterior bone of sphenoid sinuses, the pituitary gland and the tumor). The forward problem was developed to investigate the transmission coefficient for identifying the most favorable propagation conditions. Then, it was analyzed if, by the solution of an inverse problem, it is possible to reconstruct the permittivity and electrical conductivity profiles and identify the tumor presence. The results are promising since a maximum reconstruction error of 8% is found, in the worst case, thus paving the way for the use of microwaves for the diagnosis of pituitary tumors.",

In the first phase, the scattered-field data estimated by adaptive filtering are exploited by a beamforming method to produce an initial image of buried targets. In the second phase, a multifrequency inexact-Newton inversion approach developed in Lebesgue spaces with variable exponents uses the first-step image in two different qualitative-quantitative combination strategies: as a priori information for setting the exponent function and to weight the solution updates inside the iterative inversion procedure.

The failures in antenna arrays are detected by means of a non-Hilbertian Lebesgue-space Lp} technique to solve the underlying inverse problem. The solution of this inverse problem enables to retrieve the distribution of faulty feed excitations of the antenna under test starting from far-field measurements. The developed approach has been numerically validated. Simulations concern planar arrays where different rates and distributions of failures have been tested. Results show good capabilities in detecting damaged regions in the analyzed scenarios.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we address the problem of automatic image segmentation methods applied to the partial automation of the production process of a traditional Sardinian flatbread called pane Carasau for assuring quality control. The study focuses on one of the most critical activities for obtaining an efficient degree of automation: the estimation of the size and shape of the bread sheets during the production phase, to study the shape variations undergone by the sheet depending on some environmental and production variables. The knowledge can thus be used to create a system capable of predicting the quality of the shape of the dough produced and empower the production process. We implemented an image acquisition system and created an efficient machine learning algorithm, based on support vector machines, for the segmentation and estimation of image measurements for Carasau bread. Experiments demonstrated that the method can successfully achieve accurate segmentation of bread sheets images, ensuring that the dimensions extracted are representative of the sheets coming from the production process. The algorithm proved to be fast and accurate in estimating the size of the bread sheets in various scenarios that occurred over a year of acquisitions. The maximum error committed by the algorithm is equal to the 2.2% of the pixel size in the worst scenario and to 1.2% elsewhere.",

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are currently revolutionizing the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, there are still many issues in defining the response to therapy. Contrast-enhanced CT scans of 33 NSCLC patients treated with ICIs were analyzed; altogether, 43 lung lesions were considered. The radiomic features of the lung lesions were extracted from CT scans at baseline and at first reassessment, and their variation (delta, ∆) was calculated by means of the absolute difference and relative reduction. This variation was related to the final response of each lesion to evaluate the predictive ability of the variation itself. Twenty-seven delta features have been identified that are able to discriminate radiologic response to ICIs with statistically significant accuracy. Furthermore, the variation of nine features significantly correlates with pseudo-progression.",

      "abstract": "In this article, a new microwave-radar-based technique for short-range detection and classification of multiple human and vehicle targets crossing a monitored area is proposed. This approach, which can find applications in both security and infrastructure surveillance, relies upon the processing of the scattered-field data acquired by low-cost off-The-shelf components, i.e., a 24 GHz frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar module and a Raspberry Pi mini-PC. The developed method is based on an ad hoc processing chain to accomplish the automatic target recognition (ATR) task, which consists of blocks performing clutter and leakage removal with an infinite impulse response (IIR) filter, clustering with a density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) approach, tracking using a Benedict-Bordner $\\alpha $-$\\beta $ filter, features extraction, and finally classification of targets by means of a $k$-nearest neighbor ( $k$-NN) algorithm. The approach is validated in real experimental scenarios, showing its capabilities in correctly detecting multiple targets belonging to different classes (i.e., pedestrians, cars, motorcycles, and trucks).",

The approach combines the zooming properties of the multiscaling technique with the reconstruction capabilities of an Inexact-Newton (IN) method developed in $L^{p}$ spaces. It is based on multifrequency processing that allows one to face the ill-posedness of the inverse scattering problem by exploiting the regularization properties of a truncated Landweber (LW) method. Experimental data, extracted from radargrams obtained by the GPR in a real situation, are used for validation. The reconstruction results are also compared with those from competitive alternatives, such as a standard IN method or a state-of-the-art multifrequency Conjugate Gradient (CG)-based approach.",

The approach is based on a regularization scheme developed in the framework of variable-exponent Lebesgue spaces, which enhances the quality of the reconstruction by properly tuning the exponent function that defines the adopted norm. Such a function is built directly from the available data by using a beamforming technique based on a delay-and-sum scheme. After an initial numerical assessment, the approach is validated against experimental measurements in a laboratory environment, with targets placed behind a brick wall. Measured data are collected in time domain by scanning the transmitting and receiving antennas in a multi-illumination and multi-view arrangement. The processing of experimental data is performed in the frequency domain, where data at multiple frequencies are extracted by a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and simultaneously processed by the imaging algorithm. The obtained imaging results confirm the good reconstruction capabilities of the developed inverse-scattering scheme in the case of both metallic and low-contrast targets.",

The aim is the diagnosis of cervical myelopathy, which is a disease that affects the first part of the spinal cord (between the C3 and C7 vertebra). A preliminary feasibility analysis oriented toward the development of an imaging system is reported. The system prototype includes a set of antennas that illuminate the neck and retrieve samples of the scattered electric field. The related inverse scattering problem is solved by using a nonlinear Newton-type reconstruction procedure, which provides two-dimensional images of the dielectric parameters of a neck cross section. A simplified cylindrical phantom mimicking the human neck has been designed for assessing the feasibility of the envisioned microwave measurement system and processing technique. Numerical results are reported to evaluate the capabilities of the proposed approach. Moreover, initial experimental results have been obtained by using cylindrical containers and a 3D printed version of the developed neck phantom.",

      "abstract": "Brain stroke treatments are strongly time-dependent. Indeed, the literature stresses the need for quick diagnosis to guarantee the most effective therapy with the famous motto 'time is brain' [1]. Numerically speaking, a crucial goal for strokes is trying to achieve a door-to-needle time shorter than 60 minutes, called The Golden Hour [2], within which patients have the highest probability of a full recovery. This article presents a prototype of a Smart Helmet, a wearable device originally introduced in [3], [4], thought to be employed on site, to efficiently recognize and detect a brain stroke in a patient when the first aid medical team arrives. This work presents two different but complementary approaches: signal-processing-based and electromagnetic (EM). The former aims at outputting a two-level diagnosis: the presence (or not) of a stroke and (if it is present) of which type (ischemic or hemorrhagic), while the latter provides an accurate imaging of the brain that must be interpreted by medical staff. Both approaches are analyzed and compared, showing their strengths and highlighting their weaknesses.",

The accuracy of the obtained dielectric reconstructions is assessed by numerical simulations in canonical cases, aimed at verifying the dependence of the result on the size of the conducting enclosure and comparing results with the conventional free space case.

The developed setup is composed by an ad-hoc measurement prototype equipped with an efficient imaging method for the reconstruction of the distribution of the electric conductivity of the body under test. In particular, a time-difference formulation is adopted, and the resulting ill-posed equation is solved by means of an iterative procedure performing a regularization in the framework of Lebesgue spaces. The performance of the method has been assessed by means of several numerical simulations. Moreover, a preliminary validation with experimental data has been performed. The obtained results confirm that the approach is able to effectively detect inclusions with different sizes and locations inside the considered head models.",

      "abstract": "Stroke identification by means of microwave tomography requires a very accurate reconstruction of the dielectric properties inside patient's head. This is possible when a precise measurement system is combined with a full nonlinear inversion method. In this article, the inversion of S-parameter data collected in a metallic chamber is performed with a nonlinear inversion strategy in Lebesgue spaces with nonconstant exponents. This is the first time that this kind of nonlinear S-parameter electromagnetic formulation has been applied to this problem. The inverse-scattering method incorporates a 2-D electromagnetic model of the imaging chamber based on a finite-element formulation, which has led to a complete redefinition of the solving procedure with respect to previous works. This allows a suitable description of the multistatic S-parameters due to the interactions between the incident radiation and the structure under test. The developed inversion procedure is first assessed by means of numerical simulations. The experimental results, obtained with a clinical microwave system prototype containing a liquid-filled 3-D SAM phantom with an inhomogeneity mimicking a hemorrhagic stroke, further prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

      "abstract": "Radiomics is defined as the use of automated or semi-automated post-processing and analysis of multiple features derived from imaging exams. Extracted features might generate models able to predict the molecular profile of solid tumors. The aim of this study was to develop a predictive algorithm to define the mutational status of EGFR in treatment-nave patients with advanced non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). CT scans from 109 treatment-nave patients with NSCLC (21 EGFR-mutant and 88 EGFR-wild type) underwent radiomics analysis to develop a machine learning model able to recognize EGFR-mutant from EGFR-WT patients via CT scans. A “test–retest” approach was used to identify stable radiomics features. The accuracy of the model was tested on an external validation set from another institution and on a dataset from the Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). The machine learning model that considered both radiomic and clinical features (gender and smoking status) reached a diagnostic accuracy of 88.1% in our dataset with an AUC at the ROC curve of 0.85, whereas the accuracy values in the datasets from TCIA and the external institution were 76.6% and 83.3%, respectively. Furthermore, 17 distinct radiomics features detected at baseline CT scan were associated with subsequent development of T790M during treatment with an EGFR inhibitor. In conclusion, our machine learning model was able to identify EGFR-mutant patients in multiple validation sets with globally good accuracy, especially after data optimization. More comprehensive training sets might result in further improvement of radiomics-based algorithms. Significance: These findings demonstrate that data normalization and “test–retest” methods might improve the performance of machine learning models on radiomics images and increase their reliability when used on external validation datasets.",

The preliminary findings indicate a quite good reconstruction of dielectric properties and the possibility to evaluate the spinal canal dimension.",

      "abstract": "This work deals with the electromagnetic characterization of Carasau bread doughs, in the microwave range region. The microstructure, texture, product quality, and dielectric properties were investigated, jointly with a thorough thermogravimetric analysis. The goal is to link the physical properties with the product quality and to process variables. The variation of the dielectric properties during the dough leavening is studied. The dielectric properties of raw materials (water, yeast, salt, and semolina) were measured from 500 MHz to 8.5 GHz. Given the heterogeneous character of bread microstructure, the possibility of predicting by using mixing formula the final characteristic of a standard Carasau bread dough, manufactured with three different semolina wheat batches, is investigated. A power-law model can predict the average dough properties for frequencies higher than 2.45 GHz. This work proposes a dielectric spectroscopy model for this food material. A third-order Cole-Cole model can describe the dielectric spectra of the Carasau doughs over the entire frequency range. The decrease of the complex permittivity of the dough during leavening can be modeled with a reduction of the static permittivity and a decrement of the electrical conductivity. This study can foster the development of a microwave inline system for leavening monitoring.",

      "abstract": "The quantitative inspection of unknown targets or bodies by means of microwave tomography requires a proper modeling of the field scattered by the structures under test, which in turn depends on several factors related to the adopted antennas and measurement configuration. In this article, a multifrequency tomographic approach in nonconstant-exponent Lebesgue spaces is enhanced by a preliminary step that processes the measured scattered field with a neural network based on long short-term memory cells. In the considered cases, this approach allows dealing with measurements in three-dimensional settings obtained with non-ideal antennas and measurement points, while retaining a canonical two-dimensional formulation of the inverse problem. The adopted data-driven model is trained with a set of simulations of cylindrical targets performed with a finite-difference time domain method, considering a simplified bistatic measurement configuration as an initial case study. The inversion procedure is then validated with numerical simulations involving cylindrical and spherical structures.",

      "abstract": "A hybrid inversion scheme for through-the-wall imaging is proposed in this paper. The approach is based on a linearized model of the inverse-scattering problem, employing the Green’s function developed for a layered background. The reconstruction is obtained by means of a Landweberlike iterative method performing a regularization in the framework of variable-exponent Lebesgue spaces. Thanks to the non-conventional geometrical properties of such spaces, it is possible to enhance the reconstruction capabilities, e.g., by promoting sparseness and reducing over-smoothing. The exponent function defining the specific space adopted in the inversion procedure is adaptively obtained directly from the measured data, through a truncated-singular value decomposition method. In this way, it is possible to precompute and reuse in both steps, for a given scenario, all the matrices necessary in the inversion process, thus leading to a computationally efficient solving strategy. The effectiveness of the approach is evaluated by using experimental data obtained with a commercial GPR apparatus employing a pulsed source field. A fast Fourier transform is applied to the time-domain measurements to extract frequency-domain data at a set of frequencies in the source spectrum, which are fed in input to the imaging scheme. Very good reconstruction capabilities are obtained both with a single metallic target, as well as in a challenging two targets layout including both a metallic object and a low-permittivity target.",

Inside the imaging procedure, the nonlinear relationship between the amplitude-only measured data and the dielectric properties of the targets is inverted by using an iterative Newton scheme. The core of this approach is represented by a Lebesgue-space regularization algorithm, which is adopted for computing the solution update at each linearization step.

      "abstract": "This article describes a microwave tomographic approach for the quantitative imaging of brain stroke inside the human head. For the acquisition of the scattered-field information, a prototype of multistatic system is adopted. An array of custom antennas is placed in contact with the head, and a switching matrix is used to measure the scattering parameters for each pair of probes. The collected data are processed by an inversion method based on a variable-exponent Lebesgue-space regularization technique, whose outcome is a map of dielectric properties of a slice of the head. With respect to previous approaches, this kind of inversion procedure performs an adaptive update of the Lebesgue-space exponents on the basis of the results at each inexact-Newton iteration and exploits stepped frequency data. This allows for an automatic setting of the regularization level, which becomes variable and target-dependent inside the whole investigation domain. The proposed approach is validated by means of FDTD synthetic simulations with a realistic 3-D forward scattering model of the human head, as well as by using real experimental cylindrical test phantoms filled with saline and glycerin/water mixtures.",

      "abstract": "Brain injuries represent a critical situation, where both detection and monitoring should be quick and accurate at the same time. Microwave techniques are thus gaining attention in the diagnostic process of these diseases. However, the detection of inhomogeneities and variations inside the human brain by using electromagnetic fields at microwave frequencies is a very challenging inverse problem. An innovative hybrid microwave imaging method is introduced in this contribution, which combines the benefits of a fast qualitative processing technique with an accurate tomographic reconstruction of the dielectric properties of the human head. This method has been successfully applied to obtain microwave images from both synthetic data and laboratory measurements. Numerical simulations involve three-dimensional realistic models of stroke-affected heads, whereas simplified cylindrical phantoms have been exploited for the experimental validation of the approach. In both conditions, the proposed technique yields promising results, which may be considered a preliminary step towards the realization of a clinical imaging prototype.",

      "abstract": "The Finite Volume Time-Domain (FVTD) method is an effective full-wave technique which allows an accurate computation of the electromagnetic field. In order to analyze the scattering effects due to electrically large structures, it can be combined with methods based on high-frequency approximations. This paper proposes a hybrid technique, which combines the FVTD method with an asymptotic solver based on the physical optics (PO) and the equivalent current method (ECM), allowing the solution of electromagnetic problems in the presence of electrically large structures with small details. Preliminary numerical simulations, aimed at computing the radar cross section of perfect electric conducting (PEC) composite objects, are reported in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

In this context, different formulations and solution methods have been devised and applied in several applicative areas [1], [2]. However, all these formulations lead to an inverse problem: From the scattering effects, the goal is to retrieve their cause, i.e., the dielectric properties of a target. When a quantitative reconstruction is required, it is well known that the full-wave problem should be addressed, which results in nonlinear relationships between the target properties and the field it scatters. Such a nonlinear inverse-scattering problem, which is also strongly ill-posed, is the basis of microwave imaging.",

Moreover, the recent extension to the more general case of variable-exponent Lebesgue spaces is also addressed.

      "abstract": "Electromagnetic scattering simulation is an extremely wide and interesting field, and its continuous evolution is associated with the development of computing resources. Undeniably, antenna design at all levels strongly relies on electromagnetic simulation software. However, despite the large number and the high quality of the available open-source simulation packages, most companies have no doubts about the choice of commercial program suites. At the same time, in the academic world, it is frequent to develop in-house simulation software, even from scratch and without proper knowledge of the existing possibilities. The rationale of the present paper is to review, from a practical viewpoint, the open-source software that can be useful in the antenna design process. To this end, an introductory overview of the usual design workflow is firstly presented. Subsequently, the strengths and weaknesses of open-source software compared to its commercial counterpart are analyzed. After that, the main open-source packages that are currently available online are briefly described. The last part of this paper is devoted to a preliminary numerical benchmark for the assessment of the capabilities and limitations of a subset of the presented open-source programs. The benchmark includes the calculation of some fundamental antenna parameters for four different typologies of radiating elements.",

The main objective of the approach is to overcome one of the main problems associated with reconstruction procedures developed in Lebesgue spaces with constant exponent, i.e., the need for the selection of the optimum Lebesgue-space norm parameter, which is critical for obtaining accurate reconstructions, and no exact rules exist for this choice. The approach proposed in this paper is oriented to tomographic imaging applications at microwave frequencies, for which the adopted inversion procedure is based on a Gauss-Newton method, which has been reformulated in the unconventional variable exponent Lebesgue spaces.

      "abstract": "IPID5180477. Several research teams around the world are currently involved in developing imaging systems, with different specific final objectives and considered modalities. Although excellent results have been reported in the scientific literature (see, for example, [1], [2], and the references therein), there are theoretical and practical difficulties that still make these techniques a challenge. The former are related to the processing of data (limited amount of information, low signal-to-noise ratios, ill-posedness, etc.), whereas the latter are essentially related to the effective realization and use of the system. In this paper, we discuss some recent results related to a tomographic system which is currently under development. In particular, a new reconstruction procedure based on a conjugate gradient approach, directly implemented in the framework of the L p Banach spaces, is presented. This inversion procedure, preliminary discussed in [3], seems to be particularly suitable for obtaining a regularized solution of the inverse scattering problem, with less artefacts and noise (on the final image) due to a reduction of the usually encountered over-smoothing effects. The effectiveness of the approach is evaluated, even with three-dimensional data, by means of numerical simulations involving an accurate model of the human head.",

      "abstract": "A conjugate-gradient-based regularization technique in P Banach spaces, in conjunction with an inexact-Newton solving scheme, is presented in this paper. The proposed method is applied to obtain the reconstruction of the dielectric properties of human tissues in hemorrhagic brain stroke microwave imaging. The dielectric reconstruction is obtained by solving a nonlinear inverse problem, starting from a set of scattered-field measurements. The presented numerical simulations with 2-D and 3-D anatomically realistic phantoms, as well as the preliminary experimental results, show that this method can be useful for retrieving the dielectric properties of the human head with a reduced over-smoothing effect in the final images.",

      "abstract": "A new microwave tomography prototype for the inspection of wood materials is described and experimentally tested in this paper. The system prototype is composed by a set of microwave antennas, used for both illuminating the sample and collecting field measurements, a custom RF hardware, and a hybrid tomographic inversion scheme. The antennas are placed in contact with the outer structure of the sample, e.g., a tree trunk, and are optimized to radiate inside the inspected region. A switching matrix connects the set of antennas with a custom vector network analyzer, which is used for acquiring multistatic and multiview field measurements at multiple frequencies. The measured data are processed by means of a combined qualitative/quantitative inversion method. In particular, in a first step, the field scattered by the inner inhomogeneities or inclusions is estimated, producing also a qualitative image of the sample. Then, these data are utilized by a deterministic inversion algorithm in order to obtain a quantitative reconstruction of the dielectric properties of the structure under test.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, a numerical study devoted to evaluate the application of a microwave imaging method for brain stroke detection is described. First of all, suitable operating conditions for the imaging system are defined by solving the forward electromagnetic scattering problem with respect to simplified configurations and analyzing the interactions between an illuminating electromagnetic wave at microwave frequencies and the biological tissues inside the head. Then, preliminary inversion results are obtained by applying an imaging procedure based on an iterative Gauss-Newton scheme to a realistic model of the human head. The proposed imaging algorithm is able to deal with the nonlinear and ill-posed problem associated to the integral equations describing the inverse scattering problem. The aim of the inversion procedure is related to the determination of the presence of a hemorrhagic brain stroke by retrieving the distributions of the dielectric parameters of the human tissues inside a slice of the head model.",

      "abstract": "Within the ever-growing field of electromagnetic imaging, inversion procedures are conventionally described in the mathematical framework of Hilbert spaces. Usually, the over-smoothing effects and oscillations that arise using a Hilbert-space formulation make the dielectric reconstruction of targets inaccurate. This problem is strongly reduced by the recent development of inversion techniques in Banach spaces. However, the selection of the Banach space norm parameter is critical for obtaining precise reconstructions, and no exact rules exist for this choice. To overcome this issue, an innovative approach in variable exponent Lebesgue spaces is proposed here, along with a preliminary numerical validation.",

      "abstract": "Tree trunk inspection is a very important task to predict possible collapses of trees and thus prevent harming people and damages to infrastructure. To perform such investigation non-invasively, ground-penetrating radar (GPR) appears to be a very promising tool. The objective of this paper is to test a frequency-domain radar system with a new home-made transverse electromagnetic (TEM) horn antenna to investigate the internal structure of a laboratory model of a tree trunk. In order to test the horn antenna, a calibration was performed to determine its transfer functions following the intrinsic antenna model of Lambot et al Subsequently, a radar profile was acquired over a sand box to test its imaging capabilities. Finally, a circumferential acquisition around the laboratory model with different antenna-medium distances was performed. Results were compared to a classical time-domain radar acquisition. The new acquired data showed very good GPR profiles, so the horn antenna proved to be a suitable tool for our measurements. In the end, influence of a polar representation of an irregular tree trunk was discussed and the structure from motion (SfM) technique was proposed to acquire a correct shape of an irregular cross section.",

      "abstract": "The treatments for brain stroke are strongly timedependent. The medical literature highlights the need of a quick diagnosis in order to guarantee the most effective therapy. An important target for strokes is trying to achieve a Door-to-Needle (DTN) time of less than 60 minutes, which is called Golden Hour [1]. This paper proposes a mobile Smart Helmet (SH) thought to be worn by a patient when the first aid medical team arrives and the aim is to efficiently recognize and detect a brain stroke, on site. While similar solutions in the literature employ the (usually computationally heavy) electromagnetic field inversion problem and image analysis, the proposal of this paper is an NN-based SH. It uses signal analysis to recognize the presence of a stroke with a limited computational burden. In the reported preliminary experiments, carried out via simulations, we have employed a MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) model that implements a 4-layer NN. Numerical results show that proposed signal analysis, applied to a single brain model, is able to efficiently detect the stroke presence with an accuracy around 90%.",

Since the measurement of the phase of electromagnetic waves can be still considered expensive in real applications, in this paper only the magnitude of the scattering wave fields is measured in order to allow a reduction of the cost of the measurement apparatus. In this respect, we firstly analyse the properties of the phaseless scattering nonlinear forward modelling operator in its integral form and we provide an analytical expression for computing its Fréchet derivative. Then, we propose an inexact Newton method to solve the associated nonlinear inverse problems, where any linearized step is solved by a L<sup>p</sup> Banach space iterative regularization method which acts on the dual space L<sup>p∗</sup>. Indeed, it is well known that regularization in special Banach spaces, such us L<sup>p</sup> with 1 < p < 2, allows to promote sparsity and to reduce Gibbs phenomena and over-smoothness.

In this work, a numerical technique for solving the 3D Lippmann-Schwinger integral equation of the inverse scattering problem via Gauss-Newton linearization in Banach spaces is analysed.

Numerical tests show that the approximations give a faster restoration without loosing accuracy.",

The effectiveness of the approach is verified by means of numerical simulations in a noisy environment aimed at evaluating the reconstruction capabilities with respect to the choice of several model parameters.

      "abstract": "An electromagnetic approach for reconstructing the permittivity and the velocity profiles of axially moving cylindrical targets is proposed. The developed method is based on a two-step procedure, which have been found to provide good approximations of the profiles to be reconstructed in a very efficient way when the peak velocity is small with respect to the speed of light in vacuum. These features are obtained by neglecting the movement in the first step, which is devoted to the reconstruction of the geometric and dielectric properties of the cylindrical targets. Starting from these values, the velocities are then identified in the second step. The paper reports the mathematical formulation of the approach, as well as some numerical simulations concerning elliptic multilayer cylinders with axially moving layers.",
