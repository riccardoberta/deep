      "abstract": "The use of multiple access protocols information in Internet of Things (IoT) environments has gained significant interest over the past decade, particularly for crowd behavior monitoring. Due to its high data rates and low infrastructure requirements, WiFi is considered one of the most promising wireless technologies for leveraging the explosive growth of transmitted data from mobile devices. However, with the introduction of MAC address randomization and the application of new randomization policies on assigning randomized sequence numbers (SNs) to transmitted frames in mobile devices to enhance privacy, traditional approaches to device identification face significant challenges. To tackle this issue, we conduct a comprehensive analysis at the multiple access level and propose CrowdWatch which is an innovative framework designed to enhance the understanding and utilization of MAC randomization dynamics. Additionally, we introduce a novel approach that leverages multiple device-specific features to accurately associate frames with randomized MAC addresses to their corresponding devices. By integrating multimodal fingerprints, the framework can effectively identify mobile devices and track their behavior. The presented approach ensures reliable detection even under the latest randomization policies. We examined the introduced framework through real-world experiments, and the findings prove that it is an effective solution for smart building management and occupancy estimation in dynamic environments.",

As mobile devices become increasingly sophisticated, their capacity for wireless communication presents both opportunities for enhanced connectivity and privacy-related challenges. This study examines critical features of probe request frames and their role in device fingerprinting. We highlight the challenges and advancements in communicating between mobile devices and nearby networks by analyzing the randomization policies employed by various operating systems and their effectiveness in masking device identities. Through comprehensive experiments conducted across multiple mobile devices and operating system versions, we capture and analyze probe request frames under different user-device interaction phases. Our findings indicate variations in transmission frequency and the impact of connection states on broadcasting characteristics. We also investigate the deployed randomization policies in different brands of mobile devices, uncovering their influence on privacy preservation. This research provides notable insights for developing more effective wireless communication approaches, contributing to the broader goal of enhancing user privacy in this field.",

Specifically, monitoring respiration is a critical component of this evolution, offering a straightforward yet effective method for assessing an individual's health status. In this paper, we introduce an innovative contactless approach to respiration monitoring that leverages Channel State Information (CSI) from Wi-Fi channels. By analyzing variations in the amplitude and phase of CSI data, we infer human respiration patterns. To validate our method, we conducted experiments with multiple subjects in indoor environments, assessing the system's capability to track the respiration cycle and determine breathing frequency. We also compared the performance of various AI algorithms in identifying accurate breath rates. Our findings indicate that the CSI-based system is a promising solution for respiration monitoring, achieving an average accuracy of approximately 84% in estimating breathing frequency, thus paving the way for future studies to enhance the robustness of the proposed approach.",

In this work, we investigate the use of AI for data compression in an IoT-based SHM scenario. Specifically, we evaluate and compare the performance of four different convolutional autoencoder (convolutional AEs (CAEs)) in compressing and reconstructing inertial signals collected from various structural systems, aiming to enable adaptive and context-aware processing directly at the edge. By testing across heterogeneous sources, we assess the generalizability and robustness of each CAE model, providing insights into the potential of deep learning-based compression techniques for SHM applications.",

      "abstract": "The healthcare landscape is undergoing a transformative shift driven by the rapid advancements of sixth-generation (6G) cellular networks and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. This convergence has led to the emergence of medical digital twins (MDTs) — innovative virtual replicas of physical entities or processes. MDTs enable safe monitoring and testing of therapeutic decisions, resulting in substantial cost savings and enhanced decision-making capabilities for physicians. Furthermore, they provide real-time assistance and facilitate comprehensive data analysis, revolutionizing patient care. However, their full potential is constrained by the intricate nature of human life cycles. Key factors include the choice of data types and the communication protocols used to connect physical and digital twins. For individuals with disabilities, integrating wearable devices with edge computing and WiFi-based Channel State Information (CSI) can effectively monitor health metrics and recognize activities. Although the integration of 6G and IoT technologies holds the promise of enabling seamless communication between physical and digital twins, this paper, which is developed in the framework of the HIPPOCRATES project, focuses on a currently implementable architecture for MDTs based on the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. The proposed system integrates CSI to augment health monitoring and intervention, particularly for individuals with disabilities.",

This broadcasting leaks fingerprints that can be used to identify the presence and movement of flow in a given area. To protect users' privacy and location, probe requests use randomized MAC addresses generated according to the randomization protocols. In this paper, we analyze the behavior and characteristics of probe request frames across different devices from various vendors, operating systems, and features, as well as the influence of user-device interaction in different phases. In particular, we provide a detailed examination of the adoption of MAC address randomization techniques to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of recent randomization policies and to demonstrate that, despite the OS implementation, there is still potential to utilize open Wi-Fi in different services and development.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, the increase in the elderly population has placed significant burdens on post-rehabilitation schemes, resulting in high logistical costs and considerable social impacts due to hospitalization or frequent visits. These challenges call for a transformation in the traditional approach to physical patient care, which can be achieved by leveraging the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), particularly through the use of pervasive wearable sensors. When attached to patients during treatment or therapy, these sensors can provide valuable supplementary information to healthcare professionals. When it comes to adopting IoMT technologies, cost efficiency, portability, and generalization are key factors. Specifically, this study aims to enhance the cost-effectiveness and versatility of wearable eHealth monitoring architectures that utilize foot pressure-sensing hardware for the motor assessment of post-stroke and neurologically impaired patients. It leverages lower limb inertial measurement unit sensory information and machine learning to mitigate the reliance on foot pressure-sensing hardware. We demonstrate the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in predicting fine-scale foot pressure using only inexpensive, off-the-shelf motion sensors. We propose a self-supervised, exercise-agnostic asynchronous foot pressure decoding model that does not require human annotation. The algorithm is thoroughly evaluated using appropriate performance metrics, and our experimental tests show promising results.",

      "abstract": "Structural health monitoring (SHM) is a process aimed at studying variations in the expected behavior of a structure in order to locate damage, material deterioration and other abnormalities. To this aim, SHM is usually performed continuously, thus generating large amounts of data, often by employing wired, expensive and proprietary systems. Introducing low-cost, low-energy consumption and low-rate IoT devices allows for cheaper and easier installations also in scenarios where computation and transmission resources are limited. Since many structural signals (e.g., vibrations) are sparse in the frequency domain, it is possible to apply well-known compressive sensing (CS) techniques to limit the amount of information to be transmitted. CS allows recovering a vector using a reduced amount of entries, thus being able to perform sub-Nyquist sampling. This article shows the results obtained by applying CS to inertial signals coming from wireless IoT devices, developed as laboratory prototypes, applied to real structures (specifically, a bridge). Such findings are further expanded by discussing the efficiency of CS with respect to the number of used samples and its feasibility for IoT applications, from the transmission burden and energy consumption standpoints.",

      "abstract": "Despite recent advancements, Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) remains a difficult task, particularly when dealing with drone videos. A variety of challenges, such as data association, varying levels of occlusion, camera motion, and missing detection, affect the effectiveness of MOT tasks. Data association in tracking-by-detection approaches plays a critical role in determining how detections from previous frames are linked to generate coherent tracks. To address this challenge, merging spatial and visual cues may not lead to identical matching pairs for the given detections and tracks. Thus, the performance of the MOT task can be improved by pairing them individually and then determining the best matching pair. It is therefore proposed a Multi-Class MOT (MCMOT) tracker with a cascaded data association strategy in which, during the first stage, matching pairs based on appearance and spatial information are identified separately. The best matching pair is then identified out of these pairs in the second stage and updated as an active track. In addition, the Kalman Filter (KF) estimation and Constant Velocity Assumption (CVA) model are employed to effectively address scenarios involving missed detections and occlusion handling by utilizing motion data. Experiments were carried out on the two state-of-the-art datasets, VisDrone-MOT and UA-DETRAC, to validate the effectiveness of the proposed MCMOT tracker, which demonstrated the improved performance when compared against six different state-of-the-art trackers by providing as input different detectors.",

      "abstract": "Human balance is essential for everyday activities, from basic functions like standing and walking to more complex movements required in sports and work tasks. Optimal balance reduces the risk of falls, a major cause of injuries among the elderly and individuals with certain medical conditions. However, traditional force platforms can be prohibitively expensive for smaller clinics and individual practitioners, and patients with mobility issues may find it difficult to access locations equipped with such platforms. In light of these challenges, this work explores the effectiveness and versatility of using simpler hardware for pressure sensing. As an alternative to conventional force platforms, low-cost wearable sensors, such as Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs), have been explored. This research focuses on developing a simple yet effective balance evaluation system using smart-glasses embedded with an IMU sensor to replace traditional feet pressure sensing machines. Furthermore, we developed a custom dataset for the estimation of sway parameters by simultaneously collecting the IMU data and labels from the force platform for a set of 20 participants. We experimented with various Deep Learning (DL) models, leveraging the latest advancements in Machine Learning (ML), to estimate sway parameters such as sway path, sway area, and their ratio, typically measured by the gold standard force platform. When evaluated with appropriate performance criteria, the experimental results indicate that our proposed methodology performs robustly using only accelerometer data.",

Disparities in class distribution, particularly between long-tail and head classes (foreground-foreground disparity), impede the efficacy of less prevalent categories. Thus, the goal of this work is to improve the performance of tail categories in long-tail aerial datasets while enhancing or at-least maintaining the performance of head categories. To achieve this, a weighting and re-weighting strategy is proposed that focuses on the foreground-foreground disparity in classes at the dataset level, thereby enhancing the accuracy of less prevalent categories. The proposed strategy is evaluated using two long-tail aerial datasets, the drone-based VisDrone DETection (VisDroneDET) and the Satellite Imagery Multivehicles Dataset (SIMD), and one-stage object detection models. Compared to baseline models, most tail categories show significant performance improvements, highlighting the importance of the weighting strategy to address class imbalances in long-tail object detection.",

      "abstract": "Object recognition is a quite critical task that involves the identification and potential localization of a target inside a monitored area. Target detection usually relies on material, shape and size identification in order to infer higher level information, and it can be employed in many different frameworks and applications. In this connection, we carry out a performance evaluation campaign on WiFi Channel State Information (CSI)-based object recognition techniques used to automatically identify material, category and specific objects among daily life items. The main contribution of this work is to provide a thorough comparison of the performance of different machine learning algorithms on recognition using a real-life experimental testbed. The performance study shows that the Random Forest (RF) classifier proves very accurate in terms of correct target recognition, independently of the considered task. The employed deep learning algorithm, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), is similarly able to attain very good results. In particular, accuracy values reach 94.8% in material identification, 97.1% in category differentiation and 98.1% in object recognition tasks.",

      "abstract": "Contactless patient monitoring is one of the most trending topics in eHealth, due to the utmost importance of non-invasive tele-enabled biomedical systems in next-generation healthcare. In this connection, this work investigates Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using commodity 5GHz WiFi devices, exploiting Channel State Information (CSI) to distinguish among a set of actions performed by different people. The position and movements of the human body affect wireless signal reflections and, consequently, CSI. Data collected from wireless packets are organized into the CSI matrix, which describes the status of the link at each time instant. In this work we employ amplitude and phase information, related to the variations in CSI values, to classify human activities leveraging simple machine learning techniques. Different radio link modes are also compared to evaluate their impact on the classification performance. Experimental results show that CSI data is capable of providing very accurate results in classifying activities performed by different people, especially when considering phase-related information in a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) configuration, thus making CSI-based HAR a promising solution for contactless patient monitoring.",

      "abstract": "Alongside many traditional as well as novel applications, in the latest years, drones have been widely adopted as remote sensing platforms for road traffic monitoring in urban areas and on highways. The problem of traffic monitoring on Region of Interest (RoI) based on drone imagery is a challenging task, especially when the surveillance drone is constantly moving. In this work, two specific subtasks have been addressed. The goal of the first stage is to predict the RoI in drone imagery of traffic scenes using deep-learning (DL)-based approaches instead of traditional image processing; in this connection, the goal of the second task is to perform vehicle detection on the selected RoI. To ensure diversity and robustness, drone images with different altitudes, positions, and view points have been considered. To achieve these goals, two custom aerial data sets for RoI extraction and detection were built by collecting aerial sequences from flying unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and by transmitting them to the base station leveraging 5G technology. Two different ad hoc DL-based architectures have been designed for the RoI extraction task to maximize the accuracy and inference speed, respectively, and have been evaluated on two different data sets: 1) a custom-built data set and 2) a Massachusetts roads data set. Finally, the models providing the best performance have been combined to further improve the overall results. Experimental tests show that the proposed framework represents a promising solution for drone-based road traffic monitoring in critical areas, exploiting imagery from a variety of viewing angles and altitudes.",

Cost efficiency, portability, and generalization are key factors in adopting new technology. In this study, we investigate the potential for optimizing and simplifying hardware in order to increase the cost-effectiveness and versatility of post-stroke eHealth rehabilitation systems. It leverages the rich information available from Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors to compensate the need for foot pressure sensing. We present the first attempt to demonstrate the potential of machine learning, aided by affordable off the shelf motion sensing devices, for foot pressure analysis. Our proposed foot pressure decoding model is trained in an exercise-agnostic, self-supervised manner that eliminates the need for human annotation. The algorithm is evaluated using appropriate performance metrics, and our experimental results show very promising performance.",

      "abstract": "Compressive Sensing (CS) is a sampling technique which, provided the sparsity of the arrival domain and specific properties of the reconstruction matrix, allows rebuilding a vector starting from a significantly small subset of measures. This paves the way to a plethora of applications, ranging from specialized frameworks, such as medical imaging, to more general purposes, such as data compression. Among these, Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is a primary and current topic, focused on analyzing structures to determine their residual lifespan and their health conditions (material degradation, damage localization, disaster prevention, etc.), In this regard, CS is able to provide accurate results, at the same time limiting the amount of data needed to propagate information between different end-points. Indeed, SHM usually deals with continuous flows of information originating from heterogeneous sensors and locations, often characterized by diverse computational power and signal coverage. In this paper we apply CS to signals coming from two different structures, i.e., a laboratory model and a bridge. Results show that CS is a viable way of reconstructing the considered signals by exploiting a subset of samples while still maintaining a high degree of precision, achieving an average normalized RMSE of 0.12.",

      "abstract": "Compressive Sensing (CS) is a sampling technique that challenges the traditional sampling scheme introduced by the Whittaker-Shannon theorem. Under certain conditions, a signal can be sampled at rates lower than the Nyquist rate, introducing a different kind of approach to signal handling, both in the acquisition and in the reconstruction phases. CS relies on the property of sparsity, the idea that a signal possesses an amount of information which is smaller than the amount of data required to store it. This paper employs the CS approach to inertial signals sensed by innovative IoT devices by showing applications of real-world infrastructure monitoring. Numerical results show that our approach is able to efficiently estimate the infrastructures modal frequencies with an innovative inertial IoT prototype by achieving a compression level around 20 times below the Nyquist rate.",

      "abstract": "According to data traffic forecast reported in Cisco (2018), the volume of data transported by Internet in 2021 will exceed the threshold of 3.0 ZB per year, generated by roughly 30 billions of devices. SATCOM's capability to bring Internet connectivity in parts of the world that until few years ago was impossible to reach (e.g., in the middle of the ocean), the use of satellite platforms for M2M services has become more and more widespread, with an unprecedented increase over the last five years (see Herrero and De Gaudenzi, 2012 and Scalise et al., 2013) and expected further diffusion in the near future. One of the most interesting applications, enabled by the Internet of Things (IoT), that has attracted significant attention in the M2M field is the personal vocal assistant (PVA). It is a software agent that can perform tasks or services for an individual based on commands or questions given through voice instructions. The main contribution of this article is a performance analysis, both theoretical and simulated, of satellite networks for PVA services over cruise ships. Namely, a PVA must provide feedback to the user in a short amount of time to guarantee a high Quality of Experience (QoE) Zhang et al., 2013. For this analysis, we tested different satellite providers and we come to a conclusion regarding their feasibility as a reference network for the PVS employment on a cruise ship. Future studies will investigate the proposed scenario by broadening the performance analysis through actual measurements over a real-world satellite channel to practically demonstrate the validity of our approach.",

A recent boom in the field of deep learning (DL) has provided remarkable development in the problem of vehicle detection. Aerial views pose more complexity with respect to the ground view but the rapid advancement in the field of DL, the volume of data, and hardware configuration has facilitated the realization of these intelligent detection systems effectively. In this article, a detailed performance evaluation of some of the main state-of-the-art DL-based object detection techniques has been carried out along with an experimental analysis of vehicle detection using the RetinaNet framework on the VisDrone-benchmark data set. The performance of the RetinaNet framework has been validated together with the results provided by the VisDrone team. Further experiments are then conducted to investigate the impact of various parameters. Finally, the selection of suitable models that can be practically implemented is also discussed based both on a qualitative and quantitative analysis.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly utilized in smart cities to perform traffic monitoring tasks such as multiple object detection and tracking. The task's criticality is dependent on the drones' dynamic altitude, movable camera, and various viewing angles. These challenges are addressed once the UAVs' collected data is received. However, parameters affecting drone data collecting flight operations must also be explored, including drone actual flight time, data collection time, and energy consumption profile. The drone flight time would depend upon the battery capacity and energy consumption profile, which comprises drone movement, data collection, and communication energies. Besides, data collection energy consumption is subjected to video quality, frame rates, and data compression. The installed battery in UAVs is of limited capacity and determining actual flight time, data collection time, and energy consumption profile based on the factors mentioned above is critical. This paper develops and examines a drone energy consumption profile and proposes a drone flight strategy in a surveillance scenario to correctly estimate the drone's actual flight time, data collection time, and the distance the drone could travel from its original location. The results of this analysis are presented as a test case for flying a drone to collect the traffic monitoring data.",

      "abstract": "Drones and video processing have become a vital and integrated aspect of smart city development in several applications such as search and rescue, surveillance and delivery. Newly, camera-equipped drones are flown, and high-resolution photos and video data are relayed via a communication link to the base station. Apart from tackling the video processing issues in applications, such as object identification and tracking, energy consumption that may present a stumbling block in completing a successful drone flight for data collecting must be highlighted and considered. Drones have a limited amount of energy storage, which must be used to power the drone's movement, hovering, data collection, and communication. This study aims at building and testing a drone energy profile that estimates the total energy consumed and a maximum flying time of a drone in a traffic monitoring scenario. Additionally, the relationship between the video processing task and the drone energy profile is explored to determine the optimal strategy for flying the drones while maintaining the video processing task's performance. The conclusion of this evaluation and investigation can be conceived of as the test-case scenario to fly a drone for surveillance and monitoring applications to attain the optimum results.",

The FRACTAL computing node will be the building block of scalable Internet of Things (from Low Computing to High Computing Edge Nodes). The node will also have the capability of learning how to improve its performance against the uncertainty of the environment. In such a context, this paper presents in detail one of the key use cases: an Internet-of-Things solution, represented by intelligent totems for advertisement and wayfinding services, within advanced ICT-based shopping malls conceived as a sentient space.

      "abstract": "Drone deployment has become crucial in a variety of applications, including solutions to traffic issues in metropolitan areas and highways. On the other hand, data collected via drones suffers from several problems, including a wide range of object scales, angle variations, truncation, and occlusion. To process and manipulate visual data from the drones, a variety of image processing algorithms have been employed, each with a distinct aim. Additionally, recent breakthroughs in the field of Artificial Intelligence, particularly deep learning, have attracted broad interest and are being applied to many domains in the framework of smart cities, including road traffic monitoring. The purpose of this study is to conduct a systematic review of drone-based traffic monitoring systems from a deep learning perspective. This work focuses on vehicle detection, tracking, and counting, since they are fundamental building blocks towards founding solutions for traffic congestion, flow rate and vehicle speed estimation. Additionally, drone-based datasets are examined, which face issues and problems caused by the diversity of features inherent of drone devices. The review analysis presented in this work summarizes the literature solutions provided and deployed so far and discusses future research trends in establishing a comprehensive traffic monitoring system in support of the development of smart cities.",

In the context of smart cities and intelligent transportation systems, Structure Health Monitoring (SHM) has gained increasing attention lately, due to the critical conditions of specific civil infrastructures, which led to unfortunate accidents. In this connection, we propose a low-cost, versatile and self-sustaining platform based on the Narrow Band-IoT (NB-IoT) technology aimed at efficiently and continuously monitoring the conditions of critical civil structures. We also provide both lab and in-site experimental tests comparing the performance obtained with our prototype with respect to professional monitoring equipment. Results show a winning trade-off between performance and unquestionable advantages in deployment, use, maintenance and costs.",

      "abstract": "Remotely piloted vehicles have become more and more popular in recent years due to their increased availability on the market. In general, drones can represent a threat for public safety due to their potential misuse. This motivation gives rise to the need of devising specific methods and techniques to monitor sensitive areas, in order to deploy effective drone surveillance systems. These systems are designed to detect nearby undesired targets, and to neutralize impending threats. One of the main tasks involved in this scenarios is target localization, which can be performed with different approaches. In particular, in this article we carry out a study on the main literature works related to the framework of wireless target localization based on RF and WiFi techniques, providing a thorough analysis on the perspective of their deployment in drone surveillance applications.",

      "abstract": "Brain stroke treatments are strongly time-dependent. Indeed, the literature stresses the need for quick diagnosis to guarantee the most effective therapy with the famous motto 'time is brain' [1]. Numerically speaking, a crucial goal for strokes is trying to achieve a door-to-needle time shorter than 60 minutes, called The Golden Hour [2], within which patients have the highest probability of a full recovery. This article presents a prototype of a Smart Helmet, a wearable device originally introduced in [3], [4], thought to be employed on site, to efficiently recognize and detect a brain stroke in a patient when the first aid medical team arrives. This work presents two different but complementary approaches: signal-processing-based and electromagnetic (EM). The former aims at outputting a two-level diagnosis: the presence (or not) of a stroke and (if it is present) of which type (ischemic or hemorrhagic), while the latter provides an accurate imaging of the brain that must be interpreted by medical staff. Both approaches are analyzed and compared, showing their strengths and highlighting their weaknesses.",

      "abstract": "The leading trends in the framework of the Internet of Things are driving the research community to provide smart systems and solutions aimed at revolutionizing medical sciences and healthcare. One of the major opportunities offered by IoT lies in the ubiquitous connectivity, thus enabling smart services such as remote patient monitoring, in-home therapy/rehabilitation, and assisted living platforms. In this paper we present a prototype of wearable smart glasses able to monitor the Eye Blinks (EBs) through ElectroOculoGram (EOG) signal in a transparent way with respect to the final user. We propose a novel pre-filtering scheme to reduce EOG noise along with an analytical derivation of a matched filter to detect and count EBs. We have carried out an in-depth experimental campaign in order to validate the robustness of our approach with respect to the main solutions available in the literature. Furthermore, we have compared the performances obtained with out wearable prototype versus the results achievable with professional medical equipments. Results show that our solution is able to achieve very high accuracy in EB detection, obtaining comparable performance with respect to professional medical desktop equipment, with the additional benefit of portability, comfort and easiness of use for the patients.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, have become dominant recently in all fields including military, commercial, and other multiapplications, such as agriculture, search and rescue, infrastructures monitoring, and surveillance, especially for safety and security purposes. On one hand, deployment of UAVs has facilitated end-users and, on the other hand, this enormous increase in the usage of UAVs has raised many concerns with regard to security, harm, threats, and privacy issues by different agencies, governments, private organizations even by people in their residencies, which has stimulated and motivated many researchers toward the designing of anti-drone systems in order to be secure from such risks. The main objective of this chapter is to provide a comprehensive survey concerning the work carried out in the designing of an anti-drone system for detection, localization, and tracking using Radio Frequency (RF-) and WiFi-based techniques. In the category of drone detection, drone identification, and classification are also being explored. In more detail, this chapter will highlight the key factors of the surveyed techniques and the characteristics of such systems to deploy them, practically. Indeed, current studies provide systematic ways to understand the procedures, methods, tools, and techniques, as well as experimental setups, which have been carried out for the implementation of drone-surveillance systems. A comparison of the performance, found in the literature, of the designed systems in this field is presented and analyzed. Finally, open challenges, possible future research trends, and direction are highlighted in the context of drone detection, localization, and tracking systems. The presented survey chapter is aimed at providing a guide for the research community as it could be an ignition to work further with specific direction so making these crucial systems versatile and ready to be deployed practically to meet their potential market demand.",

      "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) framework is moving the research community to provide smart systems and solutions aimed at revolutionizing medical sciences and healthcare. Given the extreme diffusion of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), the demand for a solution to early detect neurological symptoms of such diseases strongly arose. According to the medical literature, such early detection can be obtained through the correlation between PD and AD and some external symptoms: the Essential Tremor (ET) and the number of Eye Blinks (EBs). In this paper, which can be considered as an extended version of [1], we present a prototype of wearable smart glasses able to detect the presence of ET of the head and to count the number of EBs at the same time, in a transparent way with respect to the final user. Numerical results demonstrate the reliability of the proposed approach: the proposed algorithms are able to i) correctly recognize the ET with an overall accuracy above 97% and ii) count the number of EBs with an overall error around 9%.",

For this reason, in order to be suitable for deploying in such framework, a place recognition algorithm should be thrifty in terms of resource consumption.

The healthcare system is among the main scenarios that are benefiting from this new trend, thus giving rise to the concept of eHealth. In this framework we propose SmartPANTS, an IoT-based wireless system specifically designed for the rehabilitation of lower limbs. Our system is conceived as a prototype of a medical platform to be employed during the physical therapy for patients recovering from a brain stroke condition. SmartPANTS includes a signal processing and machine learning algorithm able to automatically recognize the type of exercise the patient is performing, and to provide real-time feedback on the execution. Moreover, experimental tests show that our platform is able to estimate the execution time of the different exercises, providing values very close to real ones. Performance results show that the SmartPANTS system is able to correctly identify the type of exercise currently being performed with an accuracy of about 99%.",

In such smart environments, user localization plays a central role. More specifically, Point-of-Interest (POI) recognition is one of the most attractive Location-Based-Service (LBS) applications. This paper provides computational complexity upper bounds for fingerprint-based POI recognition algorithms. We have considered five algorithms reported in a former work: LRACI and its extended variant ELRACI, BeaconPrint, PlaceSense, SensLoc and SAPFI. For each of them a close-form of their computational complexity has been derived, both for the training and the recognition phase. The results obtained in this works allow a comprehensive and fair comparison of some of the most well-known POI recognition algorithms.",

Though plenty of solutions exist for recognizing indoor places, almost no idea is present in the literature for recognizing big outdoor places without the GPS employment.

This paper proposes a Place of Interest (POI) recognition algorithm called Enhanced-LRACI.

The main contributions of this work are: i) it solves the problem of big outdoor POI recognition without using GPS by leveraging on the concept of spot, ii) it proposes a novel fingerprint (FP) algorithm and iii) it outperforms the results obtained by other reference works in terms of recognition accuracy. Performance investigation reported in this paper, carried out on real data acquired over mobile devices (Android smartphones), shows that our proposal is able to correctly recognize big outdoor POIs in 95% of the cases whereas other state of the art papers do not exceed 89%.",

      "abstract": "The growing interest in concepts such as smart cities and smart mobility is giving more and more importance to place of interest (POI) information, which proves to be crucial in providing efficient and tailored location-based services (LBSs). Though plenty of solutions exist for recognizing indoor places, the literature lacks of approaches aimed at recognizing big outdoor places without the GPS employment. Even if GPS-based solutions assure great accuracy, they have a strong request in terms of energy necessary to achieve such result. As a consequence, if LBSs are thought on the move (e.g., mobile devices such as smartphones are used) energy consumption is a key constraint. This paper proposes a POI recognition algorithm called enhanced location recognition algorithm for automatic check-in applications (E-LRACI). It is an evolution of LRACI (Location Recognition Algorithm for automatic Check-In applications, originally reported in [I. Bisio, F. Lavagetto, M. Marchese, and A. Sciarrone, ''GPS/HPS-andwifi fingerprint-based location recognition for check-in applications over smartphones in cloud-based LBSS,'' IEEE Transactions on Multimedia, vol. 15, no. 4, pp. 858-869, Jun. 2013]) which aims at recognizing big outdoor places by only exploiting radio beacons emitted by WiFi access points. In terms of contributions, this paper first, proposes a novel fingerprint algorithm; second, solves the problem of big outdoor POI recognition without using GPS by leveraging the concept of spot; and third, compares the results obtained by E-LRACI and other reference works both in terms of recognition accuracy and computational complexity. The obtained numerical results, carried out on real data (acquired with Android-based smartphones), prove that E-LRACI provides the best results since it is able to guarantee the highest accuracy (95% versus, at most, 89%) at a lowest computational complexity with respect to the existing POI recognition algorithms.",

      "abstract": "In the latest years, the popularity of commercial drones has grown rapidly due to their cheaper costs and great availability on the market. The great diffusion of remotely piloted devices unfortunately leads to several security and safety concerns that need to be tackled. In this paper, we consider a fingerprint-based drone detection approach relying on the analysis of WiFi traffic features to identify the presence of unauthorized devices. In particular, we study the statistical distribution of the features composing the fingerprint vector, and we propose an adversarial approach to drone detection in order to invalidate the reliability of the surveillance system, by introducing fake ad-hoc traffic features. Results show that our novel approach is able to deceive the drone detection system through the introduction of flows belonging to arbitrary traffic classes. Also, the proposed adversarial method provides the expected significant impact on the performance of the system, actually reducing the recognition accuracy to about 50%.",

      "abstract": "The importance of robust audio speech processing has rapidly increased in the latest years, as the number of smart and connected devices is growing. This effect is strongly related to the Internet of things framework, introducing concepts such as connected vehicles and future smart cities. Context-Aware applications are fundamental in this evolving environment, enabling smart and custom-Tailored services for a variety of users. The use of on-board speaker recognition (SR) systems can play a key role in enhancing the customization of in-vehicle applications, by identifying the actual users and personalizing services based on their identity. Driven by this motivation, in this paper we present a performance study of an SR system, designed to face typical challenging conditions of an in-vehicle environment. We propose the design of a robust speaker identification algorithm embedding a smart preprocessing method based on voice activity detection, which can effectively reduce the influence of noise and distance on classification. Results show that our solution is able to efficiently improve the correct classification rate, even in the case of distant audio acquisition and in a variety of noisy environments.",

We present the IoT as the key I4.0 technology since it enables faster and more efficient production and management processes, leveraging the flexibility of smart, ubiquitous, connected devices. In particular, we discuss the role of the I4.0 revolution in driving the diffusion of smart products and services, by focusing on ambient intelligence and context awareness in IoT and on the so-called DIKW hierarchy. Finally, to demonstrate the practical impact of this emerging framework, we show, as practical examples, three typical I4.0 applications in the smart factory, smart home, and smart health scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Amateur drones are enjoying great popularity in recent years due to the wide commercial diffusion of small, rather low-cost devices. More and more user-friendly, easy-to-pilot aerial and terrestrial drones are available off the shelf, and people can even remotely pilot them using their smartphones. This situation brings up the problem of keeping unauthorized drones away from private or sensitive areas, where they can represent a personal or public threat. With this motivation, after a survey of the existing solutions, we propose a WiFi-based approach aimed at detecting nearby aerial or terrestrial devices by performing statistical fingerprint analysis on wireless traffic. This novel detection technique, tested in a variety of real-life scenarios, proved able to efficiently detect and identify intruder drones in all the considered experimental setups, making it a promising unmanned aerial vehicle detection approach in the framework of amateur drone surveillance.",

At the same time, the need for surveillance methods able to detect the presence of unauthorized drones meets the ubiquitous connectivity and pervasive technology typical of the big data era. This dualism drives the research community towards the design of monitoring systems able to integrate machine learning methods and data mining techniques in this evolving environment. In this framework, we consider a WiFi based approach aimed at detecting nearby unmanned aerial vehicles, by performing statistical fingerprint analysis on wireless traffic. We study the inherent vulnerabilities of the considered method through real-life experimental tests by setting up specific attack scenarios, and we devise and test a solution in order to improve the efficiency of the proposed technique in the presence of malicious countermeasures. Results show that the proposed improved detection technique is indeed robust to stealth attacks, and it is able to achieve very good recognition performance in different real-life testing scenarios.",

In this paper a speaker recognition algorithm for MDs based on a multiple-observations approach is presented. We propose various fusion and clustering algorithms aimed at efficiently exploiting data coming from MDs. Numerical results show that in many cases our multiple-observation approach is able to significantly improve the accuracy of the considered speaker recognition algorithm.",

      "abstract": "Current OpenFlow specification is unable to set the service rate of the queues inside OpenFlow devices. This lack does not allow to apply most algorithms for the satisfaction of Quality of Service requirements to new and established flows. In this paper we propose an alternative solution implemented through some modifications of Beacon, one popular SDN controller. It acts as follows: using ‘almost’-real-time statistics from OpenFlow devices, Beacon will re-route flows on different queues to guarantee the observance of deadline requirements (e.g. the flow is still useful if, and only if, is completely received by a given time) and/or an efficient queue balancing in an OpenFlow SDN switch. Differently from the literature, we do not propose any new primitive or modification of the OpenFlow standard: our mechanism, implemented in the controller, works with regular OpenFlow devices. Our changes in the SDN controller will be the base for the design of a class of new re-routing algorithms able to guarantee deadline constraints and queue balancing without any modification of the OpenFlow specification, as well as, of OpenFlow devices.",
