      "abstract": "In the area of biomedical diagnostics, microwave imaging techniques have been recently proposed for performing brain stroke detection and monitoring. Indeed, theoretically, these techniques make it possible to meet the timeliness requirements of such a diagnosis with portable systems. Moreover, relying on the use of microwaves, they are noninvasive and allow continuous monitoring of critical patients. In this paper, the microwave imaging problem is solved by exploiting multifrequency data by an inexact-Newton method formulated in the framework of non-constant exponent Lebesgue spaces. First, the method is numerically validated with three-dimensional head models affected by anatomically-realistic strokes. Then, a further assessment through experimental data obtained with a cylindrical phantom is conducted. A quite accurate reconstruction of the variations of dielectric properties inside the patient’s head due to the insurgence of stroke is obtained in both numerical and experimental cases, showing the potentiality of the proposed approach.",

      "abstract": "The electromagnetic fields (EMFs) produced by a lightning discharge are usually computed by supposing a vertical channel. However, the tortuous path of channels represents a realistic feature of lightning strikes and can drastically modify the radiated EMFs. Numerical methods for their computation have been developed, mainly based on the superposition law as applied to consecutive rectilinear segments, properly oriented in order to create a tortuous path; however, such methods require a high computational effort, which may be unfeasible for realistic problems. As an alternative approach, this work introduces an equivalent tortuous function, which aims at taking into account the channel tortuosity in the EMF expressions produced by a vertical channel. The proposed function is obtained as the regularized solution of an appropriate inverse problem, and is validated against several tortuous lightning channels.",

In the context of microwave-based diagnostic techniques, a quantitative imaging method is proposed here to obtain two-dimensional reconstructions of the internal dielectric properties of trunks, starting from scattered-field measurements. The method, which aims at solving a nonlinear and ill-posed inverse problem, combines a mild data-driven approach with an inexact-Newton scheme. In particular, the goal of the data-driven methodology, which is adopted here for the first time in this application, is to introduce prior information about the trunk structure, helping the reconstruction process. The proposed algorithm has been tested with numerical simulations involving different working frequencies and dimensions of the considered trunks.",

      "abstract": "This article presents a new method to solve the inverse problem of reconstructing the lightning return-stroke current from measurements of the radiated magnetic field. Although the lightning channel is still assumed to be straight, vertical, and at a known distance from the sensors measuring the fields, no model or channel-base measurement of the current is required, so that, unlike previous approaches to this kind of inverse problem, several assumptions on the current propagation along the channel can be dropped. The method is formulated in the frequency domain and is based on a double Fourier series (DFS) representation of the unknown current as a function of two variables, i.e., the vertical coordinate and the frequency. The theoretical investigation results in an inversion algorithm, which is tested against simulated data in order to obtain some examples of current reconstruction.",

      "abstract": "Quantitative inversion of GPR data opens the door to precise characterization of underground environments. However, in order to make the inverse scattering problem solution easier from a computational viewpoint, simplifying assumptions are often applied, i.e., two-dimensional approximations or the consideration of idealized field probes and electromagnetic sources. These assumptions usually produce modeling errors, which can degrade the dielectric reconstruction results considerably. In this article, a processing step based on long short-term memory cells is proposed for the first time to correct the modeling error in a multiantenna GPR setting. In particular, time-domain GPR data are fed into a neural network trained with couples of finite-difference time-domain simulations, where a set of sample targets are simulated in both realistic and idealized configurations. Once trained, the neural network outputs an approximation of multiantenna GPR data as they are collected by an ideal two-dimensional measurement setup. The inversion of the processed data is then accomplished by means of a regularizing Newton-based nonlinear scheme with variable exponent Lebesgue space formulation. A numerical study has been conducted to assess the capabilities of the proposed inversion methodology. The results indicate the possibility of effectively compensating for modeling error in the considered test cases.",

In particular, data are collected using a low-cost 24 GHz off-the-shelf FMCW radar, combined with an embedded Raspberry Pi device for data acquisition and processing. An FFT-based processing scheme is then applied to obtain a sequence of range-Doppler maps, which are provided in input to different convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures for classifying the targets (cars, motorcycles, or pedestrians) eventually passing in front of the radar. Specifically, two approaches have been followed and compared. In the first one, single range-Doppler maps are processed alone using a convolutional neural network, and then a voting mechanism is applied to select the target classes. In the second approach, a sequence of range-Doppler maps is processed using a time-distributed layer feeding a recurrent neural network. The CNNs are deployed on the Raspberry Pi providing the target classification on a low-cost embedded device. The obtained results show that the proposed approaches allow for effectively detecting the different types of targets running on an embedded device in less than one second.",

      "abstract": "Brain stroke is a pathology affecting a significant number of people worldwide. A fast diagnosis is required to administer the correct therapy and frequent monitoring is usually necessary during follow-up. Microwave imaging represents a promising technology able to address such needs and that may complement gold-standard systems. In this framework, a novel Lebesgue-space approach for microwave imaging of stroke is presented in this paper. The developed method combines an inexact-Newton inversion technique in variable-exponent Lebesgue spaces with a data-driven regularization term. In this way, a-priori information about the configuration under test, e.g., the head structure, can be exploited and the convergence of the method can be enhanced. The method is preliminarily evaluated by means of numerical simulations involving realistic head phantoms. The obtained results confirm that the developed approach allows identifying and characterizing the stroke with a good accuracy.",

      "abstract": "Accurately characterizing wave energy dynamics in coastal regions is critical for applications ranging from renewable energy assessment to coastal safety and environmental monitoring. This paper introduces an advanced methodology that leverages Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar technology, enhanced by sophisticated signal processing techniques, to analyze and quantify wave energy in near-shore environments. By focusing on the normalized power spectrum, we explore how different wave conditions influence the distribution of energy across various frequencies. Our approach involves a comparative analysis of multiple signal processing methods, including Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), to enhance the accuracy and resolution of wave energy measurements. Experimental results from field tests conducted in coastal areas demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques, revealing significant improvements in the radar's ability to capture detailed wave dynamics. The findings underscore the potential of this enhanced FMCW radar system as a reliable and cost-effective tool for real-time coastal monitoring, offering valuable insights for applications such as renewable energy forecasting and the protection of coastal infrastructure. This study contributes to the growing body of research on non-contact hydrological sensing, highlighting the critical role of signal processing in advancing the precision and utility of radar-based wave energy assessments.",

      "abstract": "The electric fields radiated by a lightning discharge may represent an important source of damage for electric and electronic equipment. Often, an analysis of such fields in the frequency domain is necessary and their frequency-domain expressions have always been evaluated by considering an infinite time-window and omitting the zero-frequency term coming from the static component of the fields. This work shows that, in order to take into proper account such component, the classical expressions of the electric fields in the frequency domain should be modified by including a distributional term. This aspect may strongly affect numerical algorithms such as the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), since the agreement between Fourier Transform (FT) and FFT is guaranteed only if the FT is a function. Starting from this issue, the present work proposes new frequency-domain expressions of the radial and vertical electric fields by assuming, more realistically, that the time window in which the fields are measured is finite. As a result, the new FT of each time-windowed field is wholly functional again, but it turns out to be modified with respect to its traditional expression.",

      "abstract": "By relying on suitable propagation models, lightning electromagnetic fields can be computed from the knowledge of the channel-base current (CBC) and of the attenuation function. While the CBC is measured by means of instrumented towers, a parametric attenuation function is usually assumed a priori and then compared with the measured fields in order to find optimal values for the CBC parameters. Unlike this approach, the present paper proposes a methodology for the reconstruction of the attenuation function whereby the latter is obtained as the solution of an inverse problem (while maintaining the same kind of input data). Moreover, for the sake of generality, the framework is formulated by considering possibly short time-windows, so that meaningful information can be recovered even when a complete recording of the lightning discharge process is not available. The inversion method is based on an iterative Tikhonov regularization procedure. The proposed approach is then applied to simulated data of electric and magnetic fields, as well as of CBC current, blurred by numerical noise in the time domain. The resulting algorithm turns out to provide a good accuracy in reconstructing a fictitious attenuation function. Finally, a short sensitivity analysis on the electromagnetic field noise and on the radial distance error is presented.",

Timely and adequate treatments play a fundamental role since radically different therapies are required for ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, and a misdiagnosis can cause further damage. In this scenario, microwave imaging is emerging as a powerful tool for non-invasive diagnostics [1]. However, it requires the solution of a problem that is inherently non-linear and ill-posed.

Following a thorough evaluation of the dough dielectric properties, a suitable antenna layout has been selected, pointing out the advantages in the choice of a contactless narrow-band antenna in comparison to wide-band and dual-band ones. The presented simulated results are then validated using a prototype sensor and an ad hoc measurement system to confirm the antenna ability to discriminate among doughs with different water content. In addition, an accurate analysis of possible sources of misinterpretation of the results is presented.",

The method, which combines a data-driven approach and a Newton-based technique, aims at improving reconstruction results by exploiting an approximate prior knowledge of some features of the region under test. In particular, an additional regularization term is introduced inside the solving procedure. This term includes a surrogate model, which is constructed by considering a set of numerical simulations based on the available prior information. The behavior and the performance of the proposed inversion method is assessed for the reconstruction of dielectric targets in a numerical test case, involving a host structure with an inclusion.",

      "abstract": "Magnetic biomaterials are multifunctional tools currently under investigation as theranostic platforms for biomedical applications. They can be implanted in bone tissue after bone cancer resection to perform local interstitial hyperthermia treatment. Given the requirements of high quality treatment, the hyperthermia therapy should be performed monitoring the system temperature, to avoid hot spots and control the treatment outcome. It is known that the magnetic properties of such implants vary with temperature. It is hypotesized that the treatment dynamic could be monitored using a microwave monitoring system. The variation of the electromagnetic properties of the biological tissues and the magnetic implant during the therapy would result in a different propagation of the microwave signal. This work investigates the feasibility of using microwaves to non-invasively monitor hyperthermia treatments with a simplified monodimensional propagation model. The forward problem is solved to identify the working frequencies, the matching medium properties and study several candidate materials. By using the numerical solutions from nonlinear and multiphysics simulations of the bone tumor hyperthermia treatment using magnetic scaffolds, the microwave signal propagation dynamic is studied. From our feasibility analysis, we found that it is possible to correlate the average tumor temperature with significant (~20 dB) variations in the transmission coefficient during a typical interstitial hyperthermia session using magnetic scaffolds. Our work brings together, for the first time, the electromagnetic material properties, the physio-pathology and physics of the hyperthermia treatment and the microwave propagation problem, thus paving the route for the development of an innovative theranostic system.",

To this end, we discretize the current-field equations derived in the first part of this work and then formulate an inversion algorithm whose output is the attenuation function to be computed. Next, as a numerical application, this algorithm is tested under different conditions, i.e., by considering a variety of time windows and underlying models for the attenuation function. As a result, the possibility of obtaining satisfactory reconstructions, even for short-duration time-windows, is highlighted.",

      "abstract": "In a recent paper, a procedure to reconstruct the attenuation function of a return-stroke current from the simultaneous measurements of the channel-base current and the radiated electromagnetic fields was presented. One of the assumptions of the whole framework was that the sensors can record the overall time-evolution of the lightning return-stroke, namely from its start to its end. However, this condition is too restrictive for most of the real data collected in the past decades, since they were generally acquired for other goals than the reconstruction of the attenuation function. Accordingly, in the present paper we perform a theoretical investigation aimed at removing such restriction. As a result, we first derive a new set of integral equations that relate the channel-base current to the radiated fields during a generic time-window, then we obtain the corresponding equations in the frequency domain via Fourier Transform, which represent the analytical formulation of an inverse problem to be numerically solved through appropriate regularization techniques.",

      "abstract": "Temperature monitoring during the cooldown in powder bed fusion of polymers is essential to qualify parts, and is an absolute novelty in the field. This is because the direct reading of the parts’ temperature is hindered by the powder. In this work, an innovative temperature monitoring technology based on microwave tomography is used to assess the part cooldown history in an industry-grade EOS P110 machine. So, relative and absolute readings of the temperature field can be carried out even for parts surrounded by powder. For the first time, several cooldown rates could be experimentally measured depending on the different polymer state: 0.56 °C min<sup>−1</sup> in the liquid phase, 1.2 °C min<sup>−1</sup> during supercooling, 0.83 °C min<sup>−1</sup> in the solid phase. This technology will allow the development of a new generation of smart PBF machines that can better sense and hence control the entire PBF process, including the cooldown phase, which is often neglected but has the highest impact on the final mechanical performances of parts.",

      "abstract": "The behavior of the return-stroke current along the lightning channel is extremely important for the evaluation of the electromagnetic fields radiated at various distances, since such fields may cause disturbances or faults on electric and electronic equipment. It is commonly known that lightning current attenuates while propagating along the channel and several models have been adopted in an attempt to reproduce the characteristics of the electromagnetic fields at different distances. This work proposes a method that can reconstruct the attenuation of the current along the channel, starting from the knowledge of the channel-base current and of the vertical electric field measured by a sensor located five km away from the discharge location. The method relies upon the Tikhonov regularization technique applied to an ill-posed problem in the frequency domain and is mainly based on the hypothesis of long-time measurement windows.",

      "abstract": "The electromagnetic lightning field is usually computed by considering a model consisting in a vertical and rectilinear channel, as well as a Transmission-Line (TL) type propagation characterized by an attenuation function, which expresses how the current decreases while it travels upward along the lightning channel. When dealing with realistic channels, affected by tortuosity, the current attenuation is usually neglected and the field computation is cumbersome, since the discretization of the channel in a large number of linear segments has to be performed. This contribution presents an equivalent attenuation function to be used in the computation of vertical channels in order to reproduce the results of a tortuous one. The attenuation function is computed by solving an inverse problem through the Tikhonov regularization technique, and it is found to be reliable for distances larger than 5 km from the lightning channel.",

One of the most important variables is the channel-base current (CBC) waveform, usually measured by means of proper instruments installed on tall towers where the striking probability is higher. However, the presence of the tower itself and the low number of registered events represent a critical issue in the possibility of acquiring a large amount of data. On the other hand, Lightning Location Systems are able to provide a high number of data, but limited to the peak value of the current. This work proposes an algorithm that can reconstruct the CBC from remote measurements of the vertical electric field and/or the azimuthal magnetic field taken during a finite time-window [0, T].",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, antenna arrays are important tools adopted in a great number of applications including radar, mobile and satellite communication systems, and electromagnetic imaging. Moreover, in these applications, arrays with a high number of elements are ever more requested, which results in a growing possibility of damages in the array. The identification of defective components in array of antennas is really significant due to their applicative use: indeed, faulty detected elements can be fixed, thus avoiding to replace the whole antenna. In this work, a diagnostic technique for planar antenna arrays is presented. This approach enables recovering the eventually defective elements of the antenna under test using far-field data. To this end, an inversion approach established outside the standard context of Hilbertian spaces is used to address an inverse-source problem. A numerical validation concerning simple array antennas has been carried out to study the performances of the approach versus some antenna parameters, e.g., the size of the array.",

The ANN is used for solving the underlying inverse scattering problem, with the aim of retrieving the dielectric properties of the neck for monitoring and diagnostic purposes. The ANN is trained using simulated phantoms, to overcome the limited availability of experimental data. First, a simple configuration with a liquid-filled glass beaker is tested. Then, simplified 3-D-printed models of the human neck are considered. The preliminary findings indicate the possibility of training the network with numerical simulations and testing it against experimental measurements.",

      "abstract": "A correct representation of the lightning current is crucial when the electromagnetic field radiated to a point of interest has to be computed. Based on the engineering models of Transmission Line type, such representation involves the knowledge of the return-stroke speed, the channel-base current, the channel height and the attenuation function. Whereas the first three quantities can be measured in different ways, no measurement technique can directly provide reliable information on the attenuation function. In the past decades, researchers have applied various strategies to address this problem. These strategies are all based on a common feature, i.e., the unknown function is postulated a priori and then validated through the comparison of the computed electromagnetic fields at one or more observation points with the corresponding measured waveforms. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach for the identification of the attenuation function: starting from appropriate measurements of the return-stroke speed, the channel-base current, the channel height and the radiated electromagnetic field, we first formulate an algebraic inverse and ill-posed problem, obtained from the discretization of integral equations relating the source to the radiated field in the frequency domain, and then we solve it by means of a Tikhonov regularization technique. The proposed framework is preceded by a detailed theoretical analysis, with special emphasis on the description and filtering of measurement noise and on the minimum duration of the measurement time-windows ensuring reliable results.",

Inspired by the finite duration of any field measurement in real applications, we introduce a time-windowing strategy, whereby the integration time-interval of the FT becomes bounded. As a result, the distributional term is removed from the FT, whereas the functional part of the FT is modified throughout the whole range of frequencies, in such a way that a good performance of the numerical algorithms can be restored. The dependence of the modified spectra of the EFs on the length of the time window is also investigated and three numerical experiments with different channel-base currents are performed to validate the whole resulting framework.",

      "abstract": "To date, tumors, the second cause of death worldwide, are a modern medicine plight. The development of rapid, cost-effective and reliable prevention and diagnostics tools is mandatory to support clinicians and ensure patients’ adequate intervention. Pituitary tumors are a class of neoplasm, which calls for suitable and ad hoc diagnostic tools. Recently, microwaves have gained interest as a non-ionizing, non-invasive valuable diagnostic approach for identifying pathologic tissues according to their dielectric properties. This work deals with the preliminary investigation of the feasibility of using microwaves to diagnose pituitary tumors. In particular, it focuses on benign tumors of the adenohypophysis, e.g., the pituitary adenomas. It is assumed to access the region of interest of the pituitary region by following a trans-sphenoidal approach. The problem was modeled by developing an equivalent transmission line model of the multi-layered, lossy tissues (front bone of sphenoid sinuses, air in the sinuses, posterior bone of sphenoid sinuses, the pituitary gland and the tumor). The forward problem was developed to investigate the transmission coefficient for identifying the most favorable propagation conditions. Then, it was analyzed if, by the solution of an inverse problem, it is possible to reconstruct the permittivity and electrical conductivity profiles and identify the tumor presence. The results are promising since a maximum reconstruction error of 8% is found, in the worst case, thus paving the way for the use of microwaves for the diagnosis of pituitary tumors.",

The approach is based on the cascade of two blocks: a time-domain qualitative reconstruction algorithm followed by a multifrequency quantitative inverse-scattering technique. In the first phase, the scattered-field data estimated by adaptive filtering are exploited by a beamforming method to produce an initial image of buried targets. In the second phase, a multifrequency inexact-Newton inversion approach developed in Lebesgue spaces with variable exponents uses the first-step image in two different qualitative-quantitative combination strategies: as a priori information for setting the exponent function and to weight the solution updates inside the iterative inversion procedure. The approach has been validated using numerically simulated scattered-field data. An analysis on the effects of the application of the two qualitative-quantitative combination strategies is presented.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we address the problem of automatic image segmentation methods applied to the partial automation of the production process of a traditional Sardinian flatbread called pane Carasau for assuring quality control. The study focuses on one of the most critical activities for obtaining an efficient degree of automation: the estimation of the size and shape of the bread sheets during the production phase, to study the shape variations undergone by the sheet depending on some environmental and production variables. The knowledge can thus be used to create a system capable of predicting the quality of the shape of the dough produced and empower the production process. We implemented an image acquisition system and created an efficient machine learning algorithm, based on support vector machines, for the segmentation and estimation of image measurements for Carasau bread. Experiments demonstrated that the method can successfully achieve accurate segmentation of bread sheets images, ensuring that the dimensions extracted are representative of the sheets coming from the production process. The algorithm proved to be fast and accurate in estimating the size of the bread sheets in various scenarios that occurred over a year of acquisitions. The maximum error committed by the algorithm is equal to the 2.2% of the pixel size in the worst scenario and to 1.2% elsewhere.",

The approach integrates the benefits of qualitative beamforming in an adaptive multifrequency (MF) inexact-Newton scheme formulated in Lebesgue spaces with variable exponents. After a first preprocessing step aimed at estimating the incident field, a delay-and-sum (DAS) method provides an initial image of the region of interest. Then, the inexact-Newton algorithm exploits the qualitative indicator for both setting the exponent function and selectively weighting the update of the unknown during iterations.

This approach, which can find applications in both security and infrastructure surveillance, relies upon the processing of the scattered-field data acquired by low-cost off-The-shelf components, i.e., a 24 GHz frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar module and a Raspberry Pi mini-PC. The developed method is based on an ad hoc processing chain to accomplish the automatic target recognition (ATR) task, which consists of blocks performing clutter and leakage removal with an infinite impulse response (IIR) filter, clustering with a density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) approach, tracking using a Benedict-Bordner $\\alpha $-$\\beta $ filter, features extraction, and finally classification of targets by means of a $k$-nearest neighbor ( $k$-NN) algorithm. The approach is validated in real experimental scenarios, showing its capabilities in correctly detecting multiple targets belonging to different classes (i.e., pedestrians, cars, motorcycles, and trucks).",

The approach combines the zooming properties of the multiscaling technique with the reconstruction capabilities of an Inexact-Newton (IN) method developed in $L^{p}$ spaces. It is based on multifrequency processing that allows one to face the ill-posedness of the inverse scattering problem by exploiting the regularization properties of a truncated Landweber (LW) method. Experimental data, extracted from radargrams obtained by the GPR in a real situation, are used for validation. The reconstruction results are also compared with those from competitive alternatives, such as a standard IN method or a state-of-the-art multifrequency Conjugate Gradient (CG)-based approach.",

      "abstract": "A novel two-step inverse-scattering technique is proposed for through-the-wall microwave imaging. The approach is based on a regularization scheme developed in the framework of variable-exponent Lebesgue spaces, which enhances the quality of the reconstruction by properly tuning the exponent function that defines the adopted norm. Such a function is built directly from the available data by using a beamforming technique based on a delay-and-sum scheme. After an initial numerical assessment, the approach is validated against experimental measurements in a laboratory environment, with targets placed behind a brick wall. Measured data are collected in time domain by scanning the transmitting and receiving antennas in a multi-illumination and multi-view arrangement. The processing of experimental data is performed in the frequency domain, where data at multiple frequencies are extracted by a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and simultaneously processed by the imaging algorithm. The obtained imaging results confirm the good reconstruction capabilities of the developed inverse-scattering scheme in the case of both metallic and low-contrast targets.",

      "abstract": "An inverse scattering method working at microwave frequencies for cervical diagnostics is proposed in this work. The aim is the diagnosis of cervical myelopathy, which is a disease that affects the first part of the spinal cord (between the C3 and C7 vertebra). A preliminary feasibility analysis oriented toward the development of an imaging system is reported. The system prototype includes a set of antennas that illuminate the neck and retrieve samples of the scattered electric field. The related inverse scattering problem is solved by using a nonlinear Newton-type reconstruction procedure, which provides two-dimensional images of the dielectric parameters of a neck cross section. A simplified cylindrical phantom mimicking the human neck has been designed for assessing the feasibility of the envisioned microwave measurement system and processing technique. Numerical results are reported to evaluate the capabilities of the proposed approach. Moreover, initial experimental results have been obtained by using cylindrical containers and a 3D printed version of the developed neck phantom.",

      "abstract": "Brain stroke treatments are strongly time-dependent. Indeed, the literature stresses the need for quick diagnosis to guarantee the most effective therapy with the famous motto 'time is brain' [1]. Numerically speaking, a crucial goal for strokes is trying to achieve a door-to-needle time shorter than 60 minutes, called The Golden Hour [2], within which patients have the highest probability of a full recovery. This article presents a prototype of a Smart Helmet, a wearable device originally introduced in [3], [4], thought to be employed on site, to efficiently recognize and detect a brain stroke in a patient when the first aid medical team arrives. This work presents two different but complementary approaches: signal-processing-based and electromagnetic (EM). The former aims at outputting a two-level diagnosis: the presence (or not) of a stroke and (if it is present) of which type (ischemic or hemorrhagic), while the latter provides an accurate imaging of the brain that must be interpreted by medical staff. Both approaches are analyzed and compared, showing their strengths and highlighting their weaknesses.",

The developed technique aims at retrieving the distributions of the dielectric properties of a cross section of the neck, from which information about the spinal canal size can be extracted. To this end, a new hybrid inversion procedure exploiting a qualitative delay-and-sum method together with a conjugate-gradient-like scheme developed in Lebesgue spaces has been used. The feasibility of the approach has been assessed by means of a prototype of measurement system equipped with ten bowtie-like antennas and using a simplified phantom.

In this paper, the theoretical bases of microwave tomographic imaging inside circular metallic pipes are reviewed and discussed. A nonlinear quantitative inversion technique in non-Hilbertian Lebesgue spaces is then applied to this kind of problem for the first time. The accuracy of the obtained dielectric reconstructions is assessed by numerical simulations in canonical cases, aimed at verifying the dependence of the result on the size of the conducting enclosure and comparing results with the conventional free space case.

The performance of the method has been assessed by means of several numerical simulations. Moreover, a preliminary validation with experimental data has been performed.

      "abstract": "Stroke identification by means of microwave tomography requires a very accurate reconstruction of the dielectric properties inside patient's head. This is possible when a precise measurement system is combined with a full nonlinear inversion method. In this article, the inversion of S-parameter data collected in a metallic chamber is performed with a nonlinear inversion strategy in Lebesgue spaces with nonconstant exponents. This is the first time that this kind of nonlinear S-parameter electromagnetic formulation has been applied to this problem. The inverse-scattering method incorporates a 2-D electromagnetic model of the imaging chamber based on a finite-element formulation, which has led to a complete redefinition of the solving procedure with respect to previous works. This allows a suitable description of the multistatic S-parameters due to the interactions between the incident radiation and the structure under test. The developed inversion procedure is first assessed by means of numerical simulations. The experimental results, obtained with a clinical microwave system prototype containing a liquid-filled 3-D SAM phantom with an inhomogeneity mimicking a hemorrhagic stroke, further prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

      "abstract": "A strategy to mitigate model error in microwave imaging by introducing a neural-network-based preprocessing of the scattered field is considered in this paper. In particular, the approach consists of a long short-term memory (LSTM) cell combined with fully-connected (FC) neural layers. Such a network, which works in the time domain, aims at extracting the scattered field contributions as they were measured by a canonical two-dimensional setup with line-source antennas and ideal probing elements. The extracted data are then given in input to a quantitative tomographic technique formulated in the mathematical context of Lebesgue spaces with variable exponents. Here, the effect of input data noise on the whole imaging procedure is evaluated for the first time. Results obtained on simulated data involving circular dielectric cylinders are presented to assess the processing error and the imaging performance against the signal-to-noise ratio.",

      "abstract": "This work deals with the electromagnetic characterization of Carasau bread doughs, in the microwave range region. The microstructure, texture, product quality, and dielectric properties were investigated, jointly with a thorough thermogravimetric analysis. The goal is to link the physical properties with the product quality and to process variables. The variation of the dielectric properties during the dough leavening is studied. The dielectric properties of raw materials (water, yeast, salt, and semolina) were measured from 500 MHz to 8.5 GHz. Given the heterogeneous character of bread microstructure, the possibility of predicting by using mixing formula the final characteristic of a standard Carasau bread dough, manufactured with three different semolina wheat batches, is investigated. A power-law model can predict the average dough properties for frequencies higher than 2.45 GHz. This work proposes a dielectric spectroscopy model for this food material. A third-order Cole-Cole model can describe the dielectric spectra of the Carasau doughs over the entire frequency range. The decrease of the complex permittivity of the dough during leavening can be modeled with a reduction of the static permittivity and a decrement of the electrical conductivity. This study can foster the development of a microwave inline system for leavening monitoring.",

      "abstract": "A hybrid inversion scheme for through-the-wall imaging is proposed in this paper. The approach is based on a linearized model of the inverse-scattering problem, employing the Green’s function developed for a layered background. The reconstruction is obtained by means of a Landweberlike iterative method performing a regularization in the framework of variable-exponent Lebesgue spaces. Thanks to the non-conventional geometrical properties of such spaces, it is possible to enhance the reconstruction capabilities, e.g., by promoting sparseness and reducing over-smoothing. The exponent function defining the specific space adopted in the inversion procedure is adaptively obtained directly from the measured data, through a truncated-singular value decomposition method. In this way, it is possible to precompute and reuse in both steps, for a given scenario, all the matrices necessary in the inversion process, thus leading to a computationally efficient solving strategy. The effectiveness of the approach is evaluated by using experimental data obtained with a commercial GPR apparatus employing a pulsed source field. A fast Fourier transform is applied to the time-domain measurements to extract frequency-domain data at a set of frequencies in the source spectrum, which are fed in input to the imaging scheme. Very good reconstruction capabilities are obtained both with a single metallic target, as well as in a challenging two targets layout including both a metallic object and a low-permittivity target.",

      "abstract": "Detection and classification of moving targets is an essential feature in many applications like road surveillance systems, autonomous cars, and smart gate systems. Multi-chirp sequence Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radars with a 2D FFT processing can be used to produce a Range-Doppler images (R-D maps) containing the signature of the target. However, in low-cost FMCW radars, these images suffer from many problems like low-resolution and ambiguity. Such problems can make the image look unrealistic as well as hard to process and classify. In this paper, we propose a human-vehicle classification method based on Transfer Learning. The classification is done by processing the R-D maps generated by a low-cost short range 24 GHz FMCW radar with a convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The adopted CNN succeeded to reach a 96.5% accuracy in discriminating humans from vehicles.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, cities can be perceived as increasingly dangerous places. Usually, CCTV is one of the main technologies used in a modern security system. However, poor light situations or bad weather conditions (rain, fog, etc.) limit the detection capabilities of image-based systems. Microwave radar detection systems can be an answer to this limitation and take advantage of the results obtained by low-cost technologies for the automotive market. Transportation by car may be dangerous, and every year car accidents lead to the fatalities of many individuals. Humans require automated assistance when driving through detecting and correctly classifying approaching vehicles and, more importantly, pedestrians. In this paper, we present the application of machine learning to data collected by a 24 GHz short-range radar for urban classification. The training and testing take place on a Raspberry Pi as an edge computing node operating in a client/server arrangement. The software of choice is Rulex, a high-performance machine learning package controlled through a remote interface. Forecasts with a varying number of classes were performed with one, two, or three classes for vehicles and one for humans. Furthermore, we applied a single forecast for all four classes, as well as cascading forecasts in a tree-like structure while varying algorithms, cascading the block order, setting class weights, and varying the data splitting ratio for each forecast to improve prediction accuracy. In the experiments carried out for the validation of the presented approach, an accuracy of up to 100% for human classification and 96.67% for vehicles, in general, was obtained. Vehicle sub-classes were predicted with 90.63% accuracy for motorcycles and 77.34% accuracy for both cars and trucks.",

      "abstract": "A phaseless tomographic method for microwave imaging is presented in this article. The developed algorithm aims at retrieving the distributions of the dielectric properties of a predefined region under test, starting from amplitude-only electric field measurements. The use of this kind of input data allows cheaper measurement setups that do not require a coherent detection or complex phase synchronization approaches. Inside the imaging procedure, the nonlinear relationship between the amplitude-only measured data and the dielectric properties of the targets is inverted by using an iterative Newton scheme. The core of this approach is represented by a Lebesgue-space regularization algorithm, which is adopted for computing the solution update at each linearization step. The capabilities of the proposed imaging method are evaluated in numerically simulated scenarios, as well as by using experimental field measurements.",

      "abstract": "Radar Target classification has gained huge interest in many fields over the years in applications like road surveillance, smart gates, and autonomous driving. This is accompanied with the new advancements in the radar technologies that made radars a cheap optional replacement of cameras for such applications. Target recognition requires the extraction of features specific to each target. The process of feature extraction may differ depending on the type of radar. Range and Doppler profiles are two of the good features that can be used in that regard. In FMCW radars, although, the 2D FFT processing technique is used for the extraction of range and Doppler information, it also provides a Range-Doppler map that many use for the extraction of the Range and Doppler profiles. However, in low-Cost FMCW radars, these maps can be lacking in quality and resolution due to some limitations introduced by the hardware. In this paper, we propose a radar target classification method using a 24 GHz low-cost FMCW radar based on spectrum analysis. The features used in the classification are directly related to the range and Doppler profiles of the targets. The classification was done on four classes of targets which are pedestrians, cars, trucks, and motorcycles.",

      "abstract": "This article describes a microwave tomographic approach for the quantitative imaging of brain stroke inside the human head. For the acquisition of the scattered-field information, a prototype of multistatic system is adopted. An array of custom antennas is placed in contact with the head, and a switching matrix is used to measure the scattering parameters for each pair of probes. The collected data are processed by an inversion method based on a variable-exponent Lebesgue-space regularization technique, whose outcome is a map of dielectric properties of a slice of the head. With respect to previous approaches, this kind of inversion procedure performs an adaptive update of the Lebesgue-space exponents on the basis of the results at each inexact-Newton iteration and exploits stepped frequency data. This allows for an automatic setting of the regularization level, which becomes variable and target-dependent inside the whole investigation domain. The proposed approach is validated by means of FDTD synthetic simulations with a realistic 3-D forward scattering model of the human head, as well as by using real experimental cylindrical test phantoms filled with saline and glycerin/water mixtures.",

      "abstract": "Brain injuries represent a critical situation, where both detection and monitoring should be quick and accurate at the same time. Microwave techniques are thus gaining attention in the diagnostic process of these diseases. However, the detection of inhomogeneities and variations inside the human brain by using electromagnetic fields at microwave frequencies is a very challenging inverse problem. An innovative hybrid microwave imaging method is introduced in this contribution, which combines the benefits of a fast qualitative processing technique with an accurate tomographic reconstruction of the dielectric properties of the human head. This method has been successfully applied to obtain microwave images from both synthetic data and laboratory measurements. Numerical simulations involve three-dimensional realistic models of stroke-affected heads, whereas simplified cylindrical phantoms have been exploited for the experimental validation of the approach. In both conditions, the proposed technique yields promising results, which may be considered a preliminary step towards the realization of a clinical imaging prototype.",

In this context, different formulations and solution methods have been devised and applied in several applicative areas [1], [2]. However, all these formulations lead to an inverse problem: From the scattering effects, the goal is to retrieve their cause, i.e., the dielectric properties of a target. When a quantitative reconstruction is required, it is well known that the full-wave problem should be addressed, which results in nonlinear relationships between the target properties and the field it scatters.

      "abstract": "This paper describes the results obtained by the application of an innovative environmental monitoring technique able to estimate rainfall intensity in real time by processing the attenuation of microwave satellite link signal measured by low cost sensors. The satellite that has been used during our work, Turksat 42° E, belongs to the plethora of satellites operating for television and radio channel broadcasting. Each sensor exploits off the shelf components, is equipped with a radio frequency power-measuring unit, and provides connectivity to the server over a wide area network. A validation of the approach with a field comparison experiment at the urban scale, comprising three measurement sites equipped with such sensors, was established since autumn 2016 in the municipality of Genoa, Italy. Point-scale rainfall intensity measurements made by two calibrated tipping-bucket rain gauges constitute the reference for the comparative analysis of the microwave sensors performance. The dynamic calibration of the rain gauges was carried out by using an automatic calibration rig and the measurements have been processed with advanced algorithms to reduce counting errors. The experimental setup allowed a full characterization of the microwave signal trends as a function of different precipitation. The results showed a strong correlation between the microwave signal attenuation and the reference rainfall observations and demonstrated the possibility to retrieve ten-minute rain accumulations from the microwave links by adopting a proper electromagnetic model. The comparison between the different measuring systems is performed by computing the time series statistics and the frequency of the rain conditions for each precipitation event.",

The basic idea is to use a set of microwave sensors to illuminate a region of interest and to measure the resulting axial component of the electric field. Measurements are then processed by means of a technique based on inverse-scattering, which provides an estimate map of the dielectric values of the area under examination, allowing to discriminate among possible targets. In order to initially evaluate the feasibility of the proposed approach, numerical results in a simulated environment are preliminarily considered and discussed.

The main objective of the approach is to overcome one of the main problems associated with reconstruction procedures developed in Lebesgue spaces with constant exponent, i.e., the need for the selection of the optimum Lebesgue-space norm parameter, which is critical for obtaining accurate reconstructions, and no exact rules exist for this choice. The approach proposed in this paper is oriented to tomographic imaging applications at microwave frequencies, for which the adopted inversion procedure is based on a Gauss-Newton method, which has been reformulated in the unconventional variable exponent Lebesgue spaces. The capabilities of the approach are demonstrated by a set of numerical simulations, in which cylindrical dielectric targets are inspected. Moreover, an experimental result is reported.",

      "abstract": "IPID5180477. Several research teams around the world are currently involved in developing imaging systems, with different specific final objectives and considered modalities. Although excellent results have been reported in the scientific literature (see, for example, [1], [2], and the references therein), there are theoretical and practical difficulties that still make these techniques a challenge. The former are related to the processing of data (limited amount of information, low signal-to-noise ratios, ill-posedness, etc.), whereas the latter are essentially related to the effective realization and use of the system. In this paper, we discuss some recent results related to a tomographic system which is currently under development. In particular, a new reconstruction procedure based on a conjugate gradient approach, directly implemented in the framework of the L p Banach spaces, is presented. This inversion procedure, preliminary discussed in [3], seems to be particularly suitable for obtaining a regularized solution of the inverse scattering problem, with less artefacts and noise (on the final image) due to a reduction of the usually encountered over-smoothing effects. The effectiveness of the approach is evaluated, even with three-dimensional data, by means of numerical simulations involving an accurate model of the human head.",

      "abstract": "A new microwave tomography prototype for the inspection of wood materials is described and experimentally tested in this paper. The system prototype is composed by a set of microwave antennas, used for both illuminating the sample and collecting field measurements, a custom RF hardware, and a hybrid tomographic inversion scheme. The antennas are placed in contact with the outer structure of the sample, e.g., a tree trunk, and are optimized to radiate inside the inspected region. A switching matrix connects the set of antennas with a custom vector network analyzer, which is used for acquiring multistatic and multiview field measurements at multiple frequencies. The measured data are processed by means of a combined qualitative/quantitative inversion method. In particular, in a first step, the field scattered by the inner inhomogeneities or inclusions is estimated, producing also a qualitative image of the sample. Then, these data are utilized by a deterministic inversion algorithm in order to obtain a quantitative reconstruction of the dielectric properties of the structure under test.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, a numerical study devoted to evaluate the application of a microwave imaging method for brain stroke detection is described. First of all, suitable operating conditions for the imaging system are defined by solving the forward electromagnetic scattering problem with respect to simplified configurations and analyzing the interactions between an illuminating electromagnetic wave at microwave frequencies and the biological tissues inside the head. Then, preliminary inversion results are obtained by applying an imaging procedure based on an iterative Gauss-Newton scheme to a realistic model of the human head. The proposed imaging algorithm is able to deal with the nonlinear and ill-posed problem associated to the integral equations describing the inverse scattering problem. The aim of the inversion procedure is related to the determination of the presence of a hemorrhagic brain stroke by retrieving the distributions of the dielectric parameters of the human tissues inside a slice of the head model.",

      "abstract": "Within the ever-growing field of electromagnetic imaging, inversion procedures are conventionally described in the mathematical framework of Hilbert spaces. Usually, the over-smoothing effects and oscillations that arise using a Hilbert-space formulation make the dielectric reconstruction of targets inaccurate. This problem is strongly reduced by the recent development of inversion techniques in Banach spaces. However, the selection of the Banach space norm parameter is critical for obtaining precise reconstructions, and no exact rules exist for this choice. To overcome this issue, an innovative approach in variable exponent Lebesgue spaces is proposed here, along with a preliminary numerical validation.",

      "abstract": "Tree trunk inspection is a very important task to predict possible collapses of trees and thus prevent harming people and damages to infrastructure. To perform such investigation non-invasively, ground-penetrating radar (GPR) appears to be a very promising tool. The objective of this paper is to test a frequency-domain radar system with a new home-made transverse electromagnetic (TEM) horn antenna to investigate the internal structure of a laboratory model of a tree trunk. In order to test the horn antenna, a calibration was performed to determine its transfer functions following the intrinsic antenna model of Lambot et al Subsequently, a radar profile was acquired over a sand box to test its imaging capabilities. Finally, a circumferential acquisition around the laboratory model with different antenna-medium distances was performed. Results were compared to a classical time-domain radar acquisition. The new acquired data showed very good GPR profiles, so the horn antenna proved to be a suitable tool for our measurements. In the end, influence of a polar representation of an irregular tree trunk was discussed and the structure from motion (SfM) technique was proposed to acquire a correct shape of an irregular cross section.",

      "abstract": "The treatments for brain stroke are strongly timedependent. The medical literature highlights the need of a quick diagnosis in order to guarantee the most effective therapy. An important target for strokes is trying to achieve a Door-to-Needle (DTN) time of less than 60 minutes, which is called Golden Hour [1]. This paper proposes a mobile Smart Helmet (SH) thought to be worn by a patient when the first aid medical team arrives and the aim is to efficiently recognize and detect a brain stroke, on site. While similar solutions in the literature employ the (usually computationally heavy) electromagnetic field inversion problem and image analysis, the proposal of this paper is an NN-based SH. It uses signal analysis to recognize the presence of a stroke with a limited computational burden. In the reported preliminary experiments, carried out via simulations, we have employed a MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) model that implements a 4-layer NN. Numerical results show that proposed signal analysis, applied to a single brain model, is able to efficiently detect the stroke presence with an accuracy around 90%.",

      "abstract": "Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) systems are nowadays standard inspection tools in several application areas, such as subsurface prospecting, civil engineering and cultural heritage monitoring. Usually, the raw output of GPR is provided as a B-scan, which has to be further processed in order to extract the needed information about the inspected scene. In this framework, inverse-scattering-based approaches are gaining an ever-increasing interest, thanks to their capabilities of directly providing images of the physical and dielectric properties of the investigated areas. In this paper, some advances in the development of such inversion techniques in the GPR field are revised and discussed.",

      "abstract": "In conventional microwave imaging, a hidden dielectric object under test is illuminated by microwave incident waves and the field it scatters is measured in magnitude and phase in order to retrieve the dielectric properties by solving the related non-homogenous Helmholtz equation or its Lippmann-Schwinger integral formulation. Since the measurement of the phase of electromagnetic waves can be still considered expensive in real applications, in this paper only the magnitude of the scattering wave fields is measured in order to allow a reduction of the cost of the measurement apparatus. In this respect, we firstly analyse the properties of the phaseless scattering nonlinear forward modelling operator in its integral form and we provide an analytical expression for computing its Fréchet derivative. Then, we propose an inexact Newton method to solve the associated nonlinear inverse problems, where any linearized step is solved by a L<sup>p</sup> Banach space iterative regularization method which acts on the dual space L<sup>p∗</sup>. Indeed, it is well known that regularization in special Banach spaces, such us L<sup>p</sup> with 1 < p < 2, allows to promote sparsity and to reduce Gibbs phenomena and over-smoothness. Preliminary results concerning numerically computed field data are shown.",

      "abstract": "This letter deals with a recently proposed two-step algorithm for the reconstruction of dielectric and velocity profiles of axially moving cylinders. In particular, the aim of the present work is to investigate the limitations and capabilities in reconstructing the velocity profile. By considering a best-case scenario, it is shown that, although the algorithm should be able to work even in the presence of flows with very small axial velocity values, reliable results can only be obtained when the axial speed is larger than a lower bound. This bound is shown to be an intrinsic limitation of the algorithm which is only related to the cross-polarization isolation of the measurement system. Other simulations, based on worst-case scenarios, confirm that such a bound is independent of the type of flow considered, of the configuration of the measurement system, and of the errors coming from the step devoted to the reconstruction of the dielectric profile. Finally, the same simulations show that the algorithm is reliable in a wide range of speed values, provided sensors with large cross-polarization isolations are exploited.",

As usual, the inverse scattering problems of interest are recast as optimization problems. An Ant Colony Optimization procedure is adopted to numerically solve these problems. It exploits a proprietary finite element code for the solution of forward scattering problems involving objects in motion. When the maximum magnitude of the axial speed is limited to one-hundredth of the speed of light in vacuum, it has been shown that it could be convenient to split the inverse problem into two parts (M. Pastorino, M. Raffetto, and A. Randazzo, IEEE Trans. Geosci. Remote Sens., 53, 2015, pp. 1452-1462): the first one related to the reconstruction of the geometrical and dielectric unknowns while the second part has to deal with the determination of the velocity profile.

This integration is part of a wider numerical architecture, developed by Orizzonte Sistemi Navali S.p.A. and called ASNET (Application System for Naval ship design Evaluation and Testing), which also comprises an Operational Evaluation Model and a Ship Synthesis Model aimed at evaluating the Measure of Effectiveness of a certain ship design when different naval tasks have to be complied with. This way, ship design characteristics are linked to operational aspects with the aim of supporting the ship design requirements' phase. A test case, in which (i) the RCS of a marine target model is assessed and (ii) the performance of a radar system for the detection of low-elevation targets during the early stage ship design are evaluated, is reported.",

      "abstract": "Electromagnetic inverse scattering techniques are considered to reconstruct the permittivity and the velocity profiles of axially moving cylindrical targets. Two approaches are proposed. One of these is based on a two-step procedure. It is shown that it provides good approximations of the profiles to be reconstructed in a very efficient way, when the peak velocity is small with respect to the speed of light in vacuum. These features are obtained by neglecting the movement in the first step, which is devoted to the reconstruction of the geometric and dielectric properties of the cylindrical targets. The second approach is more classical and is defined as a global optimization problem. It is shown that the two procedures are in some way complementary in the sense that, when the two-step procedure can be applied, it is by far the best, with the general procedure giving large errors; vice versa, the two-step procedure is in trouble when the other one gives good results. In carrying out this analysis, some estimates on the effects of the movement on the scattered field components are deduced in the limit as the peak velocity goes to zero.",

No limitations are imposed on the number of cylinders, nor are posed on their profiles of relative dielectric permittivity and axial velocity. As for inverse problems, when the maximum magnitude of the axial speed is limited to one hundredth of the speed of light in vacuum, it has been shown that it could be convenient to split the inverse problem into two parts. The first one related to the reconstruction of the geometrical and dielectric unknowns while the second part has to deal with the determination of the velocity profile. As first preliminary examples, we have considered the scattering of plane waves by pneumatic pipes and the reconstruction of a velocity profile in a circular pipe and in multilayer elliptic cylinders.",

      "abstract": "Electromagnetic inspection techniques are becoming powerful tools for buried object detection and subsurface prospection in several applicative fields, such as civil engineering and archeology. However, the nonlinearity and ill-posedness of the underlying inverse problem make the development of efficient imaging techniques a very challenging task. In the present paper, an algorithm based on a regularizing approach in L<sup>p</sup> Banach spaces is proposed for tackling such problems. The effectiveness of the approach is verified by means of numerical simulations in a noisy environment aimed at evaluating the reconstruction capabilities with respect to the choice of several model parameters. The reported results show that, for small targets, the use of L<sup>p</sup> Banach spaces with 1 < p < 2 allows to obtain a better localization of different buried scatterers.",

The developed method is based on a two-step procedure, which have been found to provide good approximations of the profiles to be reconstructed in a very efficient way when the peak velocity is small with respect to the speed of light in vacuum. These features are obtained by neglecting the movement in the first step, which is devoted to the reconstruction of the geometric and dielectric properties of the cylindrical targets. Starting from these values, the velocities are then identified in the second step. The paper reports the mathematical formulation of the approach, as well as some numerical simulations concerning elliptic multilayer cylinders with axially moving layers.",

      "abstract": "Indoor localization of targets by using electromagnetic waves has attracted a lot of attention in the last few years. Thanks to the wide availability of electromagnetic sources deployed for various applications (e.g., WiFi), nowadays it is possible to perform this task by using low-cost mobile devices, such as smartphones. To this end, in order to achieve high positioning accuracy and reduce the computational resources used in the position estimation, fingerprinting approaches are usually employed. However, in this case, a time-consuming training phase, where a great number of measurements must be performed, is needed. In this letter, a novel approach, where the training data are obtained by means of finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations of the electromagnetic propagation in the considered scenario, is presented. The performances of the method are assessed by means of experimental results in a real scenario. © 2002-2011 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "An electromagnetic method is proposed for the retrieval of dielectric parameters and velocity profiles inside pipelines. It is based on the solution of an inverse scattering problem for cylindrical configurations. An axially moving multilayer elliptic cylinder is assumed. Relativistic velocities can be considered, too. The measurement of the field vectors is assumed to be performed around the cylinder in a given observation domain. The related inverse problem is formulated through series expansions in the spatial domain in which the dielectric properties and velocities of the various layers are the problem unknowns. The resulting equations are discretized and the obtained ill-posed algebraic system is recast as an optimization problem and solved by using the Artificial Bee Colony method, which is a stochastic optimization method. The paper includes an outline of the direct scattering formulation for the multilayer elliptic cylinder and a detailed description of the considered inverse problem. Several numerical results are reported in order to preliminary assess the capabilities and limitations of the proposed approach. © 2013 IEEE.",

In the last years, several methods have been proposed in the literature for tackling this problem. Most commonly employed approaches are based on the use of Ground Penetrating Radars, i.e., they extract the needed information about the unknown scenario starting from the electromagnetic field collected by a set of antennas. In the present paper, a statistical method, based on the use of smart antenna techniques, is used for the localization of a single buried object. In particular, two efficient algorithms for the estimation of the directions of arrival of the electromagnetic waves scattered by the targets, namely the MUltiple SIgnal Classification and the Support Vector Regression, are considered and their performances are compared. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",

Moreover, the wide spread adoption of Smartphones, usually equipped with powerful processors, accelerometers, compasses, and Global and Hybrid Positioning Systems (GPS/HPSs) receivers, has favored the increasing of location- and context-based services over the last years. In this work a Wi-Fi fingerprint-based indoor positioning techniques is considered. It is aimed at supporting possible location aware services. The main novelty introduced in this paper concerns the training phase, which is usually needed by these techniques. In our approach, the training phase is avoided, since opportune simulative propagation models of the environment in which the algorithm are working are introduced. The resulting technique allows exploiting the accuracy of the fingerprinting approaches and, simultaneously, avoids the heavy training phase, which represents one of the main drawbacks of such techniques. © 2012 IEEE.",

Preliminary numerical results concerning the tomographic reconstruction of defects in cylindrical models made of cement paste are reported and discussed.

As it is well known, it is necessary to employ regularized inversion methods, in order to mitigate such behavior. Usually, such approaches are formulated in standard Hilbert spaces. Recently, a more generic regularization theory, working in Banach spaces, has been investigated, in order to overcome some limitations of the Hilbert-space regularization. In this paper, a novel imaging algorithm, performing a $L <sup>p</sup> Banach-space regularization, is proposed for 2-D electromagnetic inverse scattering problems.

      "abstract": "Electromagnetic inverse scattering problems arise in several diagnostic applications, in which the objective is retrieving the physical and geometrical properties of the unknown targets under test starting from measured samples of the scattered electric field. Solving such problems is still a challenging task, due to the related ill-posedness and nonlinearity. In order to partially overcome such difficulties, the inverse scattering problem is often recast as a global optimization problem, which can be solved by using stochastic methods. In this paper a new approach, based on the Differential Evolution method and on an iterative multiscaling strategy is proposed.

      "abstract": "In this paper, a new approach for the detection of cracks and defects inside dielectric structures is presented. The proposed algorithm is based on the Linear Sampling Method (LSM), which is a technique able to find the external shape of unknown objects starting from far-field measurements of the scattered electric field. In particular, in this contribution, the efficient No-Sampling LSM is modified to provide a reconstruction of the positions and shapes of defects located inside a known structure. This task is accomplished by inserting the Green's function of the unperturbed object into the far-field equation. The effectiveness of the approach is assessed by means of numerical simulations.

In such a way, the efficiency of the new version of the Linear Sampling Method is combined with the accuracy of quantitative procedures.

The mathematical model of the problem gives rise to a couple of nonlinear and illposed integral equations which can be successfully solved using Newton methods. Unfortunately, the discretization of the equations involves the computation of very large-scale and ill-posed linear systems. Due to the high numerical complexity, generally low resolution output images are provided. In this paper we adopt linear super-resolution techniques in order to obtain high quality output images. In practice, a fixed number of low resolution approximations of the output object are combined together to reconstruct a single output image with higher resolution, and only a linear increase in the numerical costs. ©2008 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The application of the differential evolution method in two important areas of applied electromagnetics is discussed in this chapter. The first one refers to the synthesis and design of array antennas, for which differential evolution, as well as other evolutionary algorithms, is now considered a fundamental design tool. The second one concerns the diagnostic applications faced as a result of using radiofrequency and microwave imaging techniques. Being based on the inverse scattering problem, these techniques suffer from nonlinearity and ill posedness. The differential evolution method has been successfully proposed for optimizing this multimodal and complex inverse problem. The chapter includes a brief review of some results recently published in the scientific literature concerning the application of differential evolution to the above-mentioned problems. Moreover, the main contributions of the authors in these areas are reviewed and discussed. Finally, some new results are reported. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

Several conventional techniques are available, e.g., the ones based on micrographic analysis and eddy current techniques. However, the small thickness (of the order of hundreds of microns) of the highly conductive coatings of the blades allows the use of electromagnetic fields to inspect those structures. In this paper, an innovative multi-frequency approach based on electromagnetic waves is preliminarily proposed. In this method, the coating characterization problem is formulated as an inverse scattering problem, in which the measured scattered-field data are inverted in order to retrieve the information on the relevant diagnostic parameters. A new and efficient inversion technique, which exhibit high regularization capabilities, is employed. In this paper, the proposed approach is preliminary validated by means of a simplified structure, in order to study its feasibility for the solution of the coating characterization problem. © 2007 IEEE.",

Cylindrical geometries are considered under transverse magnetic (TM) illumination conditions. The integral relationships of the inverse scattering problem are discretized and solved by an Inexact-Newton method, which has been found to be very effective in solving ill-posed inverse problems. The approach takes into account the nonlinear nature of the electromagnetic inverse scattering problem, since no approximations are applied (except the ones related to the discretization of the continuous model). After the inversion of the measured data, the imaging method provides images of the dielectric properties of the cross section of the civil structures under test. The mathematical formulation of the method is briefly discussed and the results of numerical simulations are reported.

Starting from the integral form of inverse scattering equations, the problem of determining the presence of an unknown defect in a known host domain is recast into an optimization one by defining a suitable cost function and reducing the problem unknowns only to the flaw \"descriptors\". By considering an effective inversion technique based on the SMW formula, the estimation of the secondary unknowns (namely, the electric field distributions) is performed in a cost-effective way. Selected numerical results are finally presented in order to validate the approach showing current potentialities and limitations.",

In particular, two reconstruction approaches based on stochastic concepts are discussed.

The effects of the presence of the so-called nonradiating current are also taken into account.",

The first approach concerns the application of a hybrid version of the genetic algorithm to tomographic imaging of dielectric configurations. In the second approach, buried inhomogeneities are schematized as multilayer infinite dielectric cylinders with elliptic cross sections. An efficient recursive analytical procedure is used for the forward scattering computation. A cost function is constructed in which the field is expressed in series solution of Mathieu functions. Starting by the input scattered data, the iterative minimization of the functional is performed by a new optimization method called memetic algorithm.",
