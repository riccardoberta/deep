The same mid-ship section has been analysed from different students of the naval architecture course. Results are analysed in a statistical way and conclusions are drawn from the fluctuations in the results.",

      "abstract": "In the last years, an increasing attention has been devoted to ships Underwater Radiated Noise (URN), with the progressive introduction of noise reduction Guidelines by international organizations such as IMO, Classification Societies voluntary notations, limits and incentives in specific areas. In this context, a large effort has been spent in the study of cavitating propeller noise since it represents the dominating noise source on ships. Over the years, the University of Genoa has developed strategies for propeller design by optimisation aimed to the reduction of cavitation and noise as a side effect, limiting possible negative consequences on the propulsion efficiency. In the context of the EU-funded LIFE-PIAQUO project it was possible to perform a complete optimisation activity, starting from a real test case (a small passenger boat operating in Mediterranean marine protected areas) and retrofitting the propellers for dedicated sea trials. The present paper reports the main results of these activities, highlighting the capability of the proposed methods, through a comparative full-scale validation of the outcomes of the design activity.",

The presence of strong acoustic sources on board, and the proximity of the port to inhabited zones represent the main technical aspect of the problem. To meet the demand for control of the airborne noise radiated by a ship, in 2019, the Lloyd's Register issued a class notation on airborne noise emissions by ships, setting a procedure for awarding this notation. Numerical models for the prediction of airborne noise propagation represents a favorable element for the evaluation and control of the airborne acoustical impact. This paper reports the application of this additional class notation and its effectiveness in characterizing the noise field radiated by a cruise ship. The performances of different software in terms of the reproduction of the noise field radiated by a ship and with specific reference to the predicted levels at normative reference distances have been carried out. Results shows the potentiality of this type of approach and first interesting conclusions as regard the radiated airborne noise from a large cruise ship.",

This application is motivated by the current growing need for optimizing the number and the comfort of onboard passengers. By means of a data set collecting open information on 54 cruise ships delivered after 2000 and still in service, the attained formula has shown excellent performance also with respect to those competitors that do not need information usually unavailable in the preliminary design, such as luxury cabin volume, dead weight, and construction height. The proposed formula may definitely represent a useful up-to-date practical tool to support designers, shipyards, ship owners, and operators that is prone to be generalized with a new data set in the future and stimulate the maritime community to leverage statistical learning approaches to turn data information into value.",

      "abstract": "The airborne noise emitted by ships represents a pollution source affecting the surrounding environment and third parties. Nowadays, in addition to numerous other kinds of environmental impacts due to shipping activities, ship airborne radiated noise in the latest years has captured the attention of universities, industries, and Regulatory Bodies. Even though this problem can be quite annoying and has raised serious complaints from the citizens of areas close to ports, shipping routes along the coast, or inland waters, the acoustic impact of ships to date has not been subjected to systematic control. The problem is primarily driven by the presence of powerful sound sources on ships and the fact that inhabited areas are often in close proximity to areas where ships operate. In response to the need to regulate the noise emitted by ships, Lloyd's Register introduced a class notation in 2019 specifically for airborne noise emissions from ships. This notation also includes a procedure for granting the notation. Within this context, the development of mathematical models to predict the propagation of noise in the air can serve as a valuable tool for anticipating and controlling the impact of ship-related airborne noise. This paper, reports problems and methods on the practical implementation of the required classification checks, in particular as regards the simulation and validation problems. As an application example, a small part of the results obtained during an industrial research activity aimed at assessing the noise radiated into the air by a passenger ship is reported.",

Moreover, secondary sources as ventilation systems contribute to generate a complex soundscape for each ship. In this work, noise spectra reported in the literature were collected and analyzed to obtain an overview of the noise characteristics in different spaces onboard military and commercial vessels, i.e. accommodation, navigation bridge, and other workspaces. A prevalence of high noise levels in the different spaces that can be over the commonly accepted limits was found, characterized by higher levels at low and high frequencies. Different noise indexes not yet adopted in this sector were tested on the data to derive more information about onboard noise annoyance. Supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms were also applied to qualitatively classify and study the collected spectra. The analysis shows the presence of different spectral typologies, i.e. balanced spectral shapes (quasi-linear decay of the noise level per octave band with no dominant frequency components) or unbalanced ones.",

      "abstract": "Acoustic cameras are powerful instruments combining an optical camera with a microphone array to obtain information about power and location of noise sources. The main aim of this study is to identify key points in the application of an acoustic camera to the characterization of port noise. An experimental campaign was carried out in the seaport of Genoa. Based on this experience, a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) analysis was performed. The experimental results confirm the intrinsic complexity of the noise field in ports. Several noise sources were identified and can be categorized by their duration, intensity, location and spectral content; the analysis performed allows us to propose a basic framework for the innovative application of this technique to the port noise context. Acoustic cameras can be considered viable and useful tools to characterize and monitor port noise, following at least the minimum key points highlighted in the proposed framework.",

Resonances can occur and strongly affect the acoustical comfort into closed spaces, particularly into cabins used to rest by the crew or passengers. Four different cabin geometries from a real passenger vessel have been simulated using 3D FEM techniques in order to obtain the modal response of each enclosure at low frequencies. The density of the modal frequencies was obtained for each space. Some of those frequencies could cause annoyance and could be caused by the engines or the propellers of the ship. The presence of high acoustic pressure zones in sensible locations of the cabins is evident in all the considered geometries. This approach can represent a valuable tool at design or retrofitting stages to achieve the best possible comfort levels by adopting control measures depending on each cabin geometry.",

      "abstract": "Measurement operations are all inevitably affected by uncertainty, that is defined as the \"degree of uncertainty\" with which the measurement process obtains the result. It produces a range of values in which the true value of the measurand is present with a certain probability. In the specific case of the evaluation of the acoustic emissions associated with ships, this degree of uncertainty is referable to several causes, better understandable if the measurement procedures indicated by the reference standards are described (for example ASA (Acoustical Society of America) S12.64-2009/PART 1), adopted for all types of ship (with no limitation in size) that transits at a speed not exceeding 50 kn in deep water. The standard offers three degrees of measurement (A, B or C), which differ in terms of uncertainty, complexity and repeatability. In general, information is given on the characteristics of the instruments, signal processing and positioning of hydrophones. The standard is valid only in deep water and this represents its main limit: in the case, for example, of very large ships it is difficult to reach the great depths with the instruments. From the analysis of the prescriptions, it clearly follows that noise measurements in water are intrinsically affected by measurement errors that can be reported to the following three macro-types: 1. Error due to the degree of precision of the measurement chain 2. Error due to relative positioning between source and receivers 3. Error due to the characteristics of the measurement environment In the present work, all these possible sources of error have been evaluated on the basis of numerical simulation models whose results have been validated by experimental tests at sea, to arrive at the definition of a procedure for estimating the overall error inherent in the measurement and thus defining procedures for the control of the same.",

      "abstract": "In this study, a model is developed to simulate the dynamics of an internal combustion engine, and it is calibrated and validated against reliable experimental data, making it a tool that can effectively be adopted to conduct emission predictions. In this work, the Ricardo WAVE software is applied to the simulation of a particular marine diesel engine, a four-stroke engine used in the maritime field. Results from the bench tests are used for the calibration of the model. Finally, the calibration of the model and its validation with full-scale data measured at sea are presented. The prediction includes not only the classic engine operating parameters for a comparison with surveys but also an estimate of nitrogen oxide emissions, which are compared with similar results obtained with emission factors. The calibration of the model made it possible to obtain an overlap between the simulation results and real data with an average error of approximately 7% on power, torque, and consumption. The model provides encouraging results, suggesting further applications, such as in the study on transient conditions, coupling of the engine model with the ship model for a complete simulation of the operating conditions, and optimization studies on consumption and emissions. The availability of the emission data during the sea trial and validated simulation results are the strengths and novelties of this work.",

      "abstract": "The acoustic comfort in passenger cabins on board six passenger ships is analyzed in this paper. The overall noise inside cabins is first evaluated, then the effect of HVAC (Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning) is investigated and several criteria, typical from the civil field (Noise Criterion, Room Criterion, etc.), are applied and compared. The effect of different operative conditions in terms of revolutions per minute of engines, propellers and generators, of propeller pitch and of engine power is investigated as well, highlighting the differences in terms of measured noise and of indicators performances. The results of the study suggest that the current normative framework and regulations about noise on board ships, based on dB(A) limits only, could effectively be revised to take into account spectral components, whose effect would otherwise be neglected.",

Despite this type of emission can be quite annoying and has raised serious complaints from the inhabitants of areas close to ports, the acoustic impact of vessels, to date, has not been subjected to systematic control. In this context, recent is the new class notation issued by a classification society focusing on the characterization and evaluation of the ship source. This paper aims at analyzing the provisions of this new class notation from its effectiveness in characterizing the ship as a source of airborne noise radiated outside the vessel. Monitoring campaigns and results of numerical models will be exploited to identify a new method for verifying the notation in future applications.",

      "abstract": "A reasonable prediction of the air emissions from ships at port is crucial to evaluate the impact on the surrounding inhabited zones and to evaluate and adopt effective countermeasures. A quantification of the power utilized by ships in port is crucial, since the level of emissions from an engine strictly depends on the power supplied. In order to assess the power profile of a vessel during navigation, maneuvering and docking in the port area, several approaches are possible, although experimental measurements are the most reliable source of data. This paper presents results of the post-processing analysis carried out on a large amount of emission data recorded during the navigation of two small ferries operating in the Gulf of Naples. The research activity aims to identifying the different behavior of the propulsion engine in terms of power and emissions (mainly NO<inf>x</inf>, CO<inf>2</inf>, Hydrocarbons (HC) in addition to the content of O<inf>2</inf> in the exhausts), during the navigation and maneuvering phases of the vessel in port area. The results are presented by means of numerical tables representing the dependence between emissions patterns and significant engine operational data. The long-term goal is to use such results in connection with the simulation of the engine working conditions to derive a prediction of the emissions.",

      "abstract": "The paper covers the need of a detailed monitoring of exhaust gases emissions from the funnel of ships during manoeuvres and mooring at harbour. Just like in many other transport infrastructures, a key point for an effective control of the overall environmental impact stands in the identification of the emissions from single vehicles, in order to make possible to conceive and to put into practice targeted countermeasures. Remote sensing of such specific emissions is an issue and optical sensors are the best candidates for the purpose. The paper is based on a pilot experience carried out in the port of Naples with the aim of studying the feasibility of LIDAR measurements to characterize ship particulate emission. These preliminary measurements allowed a first evaluation of the concentration and of the flow rate of the particulate emissions, even though this was achieved by adding simplified hypotheses. Overall, this pilot campaign indicates the feasibility of using LIDAR techniques for controlling emissions (in terms of particulate matter, but also of Sulphur and Nitrogen oxides) both in stationary conditions and during the maneuvering phases of ships.",

      "abstract": "A rising global attention to the environmental impact of anthropogenic activities pushes towards a continuous reduction of such impact and a control, through monitoring techniques, of the main sources of pollution. The transport sector is involved, as all other field of anthropogenic activities in the efforts towards a drastic abatement of emissions. Shipping activities generate greenhouse effect gases (GHGs), affecting the environment on a global scale, and other pollutants harmful for human health and the ecosystem on a local scale. These latter aspects are particularly relevant in ports where berths are close to densely inhabited areas. Many efforts have been and will be spent to predict and quantify these emissions with the aim of controlling them but direct measurements aimed at the identification and quantification of particularly polluting substances are to be considered a key point to achieve an effective control of emissions. In the context of ports, as in any transportation infrastructure, an identification of polluting vehicles and a quantification in an objective way of their emissions is crucial to implement any control activity of the polluting emissions. The development of optical remote sensing techniques appears to be particularly promising. This work provides a state of the art of the main techniques based on optical sensors (LIDAR, LIDAR DIAL, DOAS, camera UV) possibly applied in the maritime sector, highlighting advantages and potentialities. Results of a preliminary measurement campaign are reported to show the first encouraging feedback for the feasibility of the application.",

      "abstract": "In setting a safe route for a ship, one of the problems to face is represented by excessive roll motions deriving from resonance phenomena in adverse weather conditions. An effective prediction of the roll motion amplification is related to a proper mathematical modelling of the ship motions. Linear models may result to be inadequate in case of large roll motions, where non-linear effects dominate. This paper investigates the roll response resonance in irregular waves. The developed method aims at demonstrating the influence of the non-linear immersed hull geometry, as already acknowledged in literature for regular seas. A 6-Dof non-linear model is applied for generating the time histories of ship roll motions in irregular waves. These are fed into an optimization routine, able of finding the linear system (focusing at its natural roll frequency) that better approximates the non-linear one at a certain mean roll amplitude. The outcomes of this research are meant to support the estimation of roll resonance period accounting for non-linearities of immersed hull geometry, allowing for a more reliable solution of weather routing problems.",

In this line, the Global Maritime Energy Efficiency Partnerships was launched. GloMEEP has the purpose of fostering a reduction in the emissions through the adoption and implementation of energy efficiency measures. With the aim of providing a tool for costs and benefits analysis of these energy efficiency measures, DNV GL developed an interactive spreadsheet for IMO. The tool is meant to provide an assessment of the impact of the various possible energy efficiency measures. It computes the effects of these technical operational measures on both the EEDI and the EEOI, and also the Marginal Abatement Cost Curve. In the present paper, use, results and potential of the model have been exploited by using input data derived from the specific segment of cruise vessels.",

      "abstract": "The rising global concern for environmental pollution boosts initiatives to reduce anthropogenic emissions. Shipping, like the whole transport sector, is endeavoring, in the last years, to reduce its share of emissions. A cooperation between ship-owners and port authorities has been and will be fundamental in this context. In 2010, the World Port Climate Initiative (WPCI) launched the Environmental Ship Index (ESI) project to encourage the adoption of policies to reduce the ship’s emissions into the atmosphere. The index is a representative number of the environmental performance of a ship that evaluate the amount of nitrogen and sulphur oxides emitted by any type of ship, compared to the regulatory limits. In this work, an estimate of the ESI index will be made for several cruise ships for which a suitable database was available. The results obtained will be suitable for future application of this index from ports and suppliers and other operators in the field.",

      "abstract": "A proper estimation of the ship accelerations, particularly in the transversal direction, is fundamental for predicting the risk of cargo shifts and inherent structural damages in severe irregular seas. A specific situation worth to be considered in this context is the so-called dead ship condition, in which the ship, because of a loss of steering capabilities, is drifting in beam waves at zero speed. Particularly in this situation, a proper modelling of ship dynamics in wave is deemed necessary for a reliable assessment of inertial loads. In this paper three time domain procedures with different accuracy are applied and compared. The aim is to investigate the dependency of inertial loads on the non-linear effects of ship geometry and on the couplings among the 6DOF of the ship. Simulations are carried out with, in input, the same irregular sea realizations in the time domain, obtained from a digitalisation of JONSWAP spectra. A technique allowing for a fine matching of the digitalised spectra to the analytical ones is developed and applied. The investigation indicates that couplings among ship motions trigger larger inertial loads and, accordingly, a larger probability of occurrence for cargo shifting and structural damages.",

While in international treaties and conventions this problem is now well treated, from a technical point of view the quantification of the impact of underwater noise emissions from the ship is not yet consolidated. The program created allows the user to identify the sound rays generated by source and, between these, to find the beam nearest a receiver calculating the Trasmission Loss (TL). The user enters as input data the source position, the Sound Pressure Level (SPL) of the source, the depth of the backdrop, sound velocity profile, thickness of the layers in which the water column is divided, salinity, temperature and pH of sea water and the frequency of emission of the source to characterize the propagation environment. Through the Ray Tracing Theory, a technique of optical geometry that is based on the calculation of the path made by light the rays are shown on the screen. Then the rays closest to the receiver are identified and the program calculates the sound loss, divided into Geometrical Loss (due to distance between the source and the receiver), Dissipation Loss (due to the characteristics of the propagation environment) and Reflection Loss (due to the surfaces that delimit the field).In output the program will show the propagation field of the Sound Pressure Level through which in the future it will be possible to identify the emission limits to protect the marine fauna.",

At first, the main onboard noise sources were identified in terms of their nature and location. Secondly, sources data on the main sources were derived, based on onboard measurements of the ferry berthed in the port of Naples. A geometrical 3D model was created, including all bodies present in the acoustic field of the surrounding area.

      "abstract": "Targets of the surface treatments of marine hulls have always been to preserve the structural capacity of the hull envelope and to maintain a smooth and clean external surface, thus minimizing the frictional component of motion resistance. These objectives are pursued since a couple of millennia by fighting the chemical and biological phenomena inducing various forms of degradation in the hull base material and/or in the external surface smoothness. As regards the latter aspect, in particular, a most negative effect is represented by the adhesion of biofouling, jeopardizing the resistance performance of the hull. In the past, solutions to this specific problem were found in biocide-releasing paintings, practice that is nowadays unacceptable because of its high environmental impact. New challenges in the field are represented by the possibility of not only maintaining, but also decreasing, the frictional coefficient intrinsic of the hull surface, while preserving excellent properties against fouling adhesion and minimizing environmental impact. The paper, based on publicly available data, analyses recent trends in the commercially available hull coatings and depicts possible development lines for new types of treatments aimed at reducing frictional resistance.",

      "abstract": "The rising concern for environmental pollution effects calls for investigations into the impact of industrial and commercial activities on citizens living and working in the proximity of water cities where ports and ships with their dimensions are a matter of particular concern. In fact, the operation of ships in large ports generates a significant impact on air quality and noise levels of surrounding areas. Focusing on acoustic issues, the present paper reports a model based on the Ray Tracing technique built and calibrated in order to obtain a tool capable of predicting the acoustic field generated by the operations of the ships. The final aim is to obtain a tool able to investigate continuously the acoustic impact of ships operation in any point around the harbor and the effect of possible countermeasures against noise generation and/or propagation in the area.",

      "abstract": "A growing attention has been recently devoted to the impact of the underwater noise field generated by shipping activities on the marine fauna. A key aspect for the quantification of such impact is a proper model of the source levels radiated from the vessels. At a first level of approximation, simplified formulations based on a small number of macroparameters describing the ship characteristics are needed to quantify the emission and, accordingly, assess the noise impact and evaluate strategies for its control. In fact, a few models of this kind are available in the literature, mainly based on measurements and databases developed for military purposes. Most of these models have been tuned on old ships: this poses the question whether they are still applicable to modern commercial vessels. In this work, spectra of a series of measurements of underwater noise emitted by commercial vessels measured in the framework of two EU FP7 projects (SILENV: www.silenv.eu and AQUO: www.aquo.eu) are analyzed and compared with the results obtained applying the available literature models. The analysis is carried out for noise emitted both at design and off-design conditions. In such conditions, the models are also compared with a proposed spectral parametrization. Focusing on the off-design conditions, a detailed narrow band analysis of a complete set of noise spectra is presented for a ship equipped with a controllable pitch propeller (CPP). The spectral peculiarities of such a propulsion plant, when operated at constant revolutions per minute (RPM) are highlighted. Results of the suggested parametrization applied to the same ship are presented together with the data of other CPP ships and a critical analysis is carried out discussing the limits of the existing predictive models.",

      "abstract": "There is increasing concern within the scientific community about the underwater noise due to anthropogenic activity and its impact on marine life, with negative consequences on biodiversity and sea resources. In that context, the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive stated in 2008 that the anthropogenic noise due to shipping was to be mitigated. To address this issue, the European Union (EU) project \"Achieve QUieter Oceans by shipping noise footprint reduction\" (AQUO) (www.aquo.eu) started in October 2012 with a duration of four years. The project brought together experts from shipbuilding, underwater acoustics, and bioacoustics, with a multidisciplinary approach. In this paper, after giving a brief overview of the project structure, the methodology proposed by the AQUO project to set guidelines for controlling the underwater noise from commercial shipping is presented in more detail. Such a methodology is aimed at identifying the most promising strategies for the mitigation of the impact of shipping noise on marine fauna. Different technical as well as operational solutions are evaluated by taking into account the impact on marine life, the feasibility in terms of ship design, and the cost effectiveness, also considering fuel efficiency. While technical solutions are usually more effective at the design stage both in terms of costs and performance, operational solutions can potentially be adopted without any modification to the existing fleet. Furthermore, operational prescriptions can be set by national/local authorities who cannot directly intervene on ship configurations. The different solutions have been evaluated by means of numerical modeling carried out by using a Noise Footprint AssessmentModel derived from the Quonops tool.",

      "abstract": "The noise associated to ship operations within large commercial harbours is an issue because often these infrastructures affect strongly the overall acoustic levels of close residential areas. The dimensions and complexity of the ship noise sources and of the transmission path to the receiver make the sound pressure field particularly complex. In this situation, even an assessment of the acoustic impact of harbours may be particularly difficult to achieve, if based on a purely experimental approach. This situation calls for the use of prediction models that, with a proper calibration, allow exploring with continuity the acoustic field in the areas around the source. Moreover, models become essential when studying corrective actions and comparing their effectiveness. Within this general context, the present work illustrates the preliminary experimental activities carried out in a part of the Naples commercial harbour for the calibration of a numerical model of the noise field associated to the operation of a specific ship. The model, based on a Ray Tracing approach, includes both the main noise sources on board the ship and the surrounding physical structures (buildings and infrastructures characterizing the area). The paper describes the main characteristics of the model and presents the procedure envisaged for its development and calibration. Results of the on-field experimental campaign in a portion of the port of Naples are presented and discussed in view of the identification and characterisation of the ship sources detected and surveyed and of the first part of the propagation path around the ship.",

The available normative framework, albeit well established and developed in the form of Comfort Classes, is based on dB(A) limits for the different spaces on board and is main-ly applied on a voluntary basis. In the present study, an acoustical analysis of a typical passen-ger cabin in a Ro-Pax vessel has been carried out in order to provide an effective and compre-hensive picture of the sound distribution inside the cabin volume. A comparison between the measured noise levels and the proposed limits has been carried out, in order to identify the pres-ence of critical areas inside the cabin in respect to acoustic comfort. A finite element model of the cabin has been finally developed, aimed at obtaining the eigenmodes of the cabin, in order to analyse the sound intensity pattern for every associated eigenfrequency.",

      "abstract": "Achieving the right balance between fixed and operating costs is a key but non-trivial task for optimizing the characteristics of a fleet of ships for a new trade at a very early stage of the design. A wide range of design choices as well as a significant number of uncertainties related to the operation of the fleet affects those two expense items. In the proposed analysis, operative uncertainties rising from rough sea conditions are taken into account in a Simulation Based Design (SBD) framework for fleet generation and evaluation. The costs-benefits analysis is aimed at understanding the effects of variations in the installed power and in the ship capacity on the overall fleet performances. These two major characteristics of the ship design (and, accordingly, of the fleet of ships realizing the trade) are introduced in the numerical model considering the sea margin and the nominal capacity as free design parameters instead of fixing them as commonly done in practice. From a design point of view, this corresponds to the introduction of two new variables, enlarging the dimensions of the design space to be explored, better than relaxing the boundaries of a simpler design space. The validity of this approach is demonstrated by a practical application to the design of a fleet of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) carriers. In this context, the effects of variations in the fuel price and in the voyage length on the optimal fleet characteristics are analyzed and the results are discussed in comparison to those coming from the reference scenario.",

      "abstract": "The prediction of propeller induced pressure fluctuations and underwater radiated noise is a subject of great and increasing interest in marine engineering. Nevertheless, the full-scale prediction of these negative effects, even though based on dedicated model scale tests represents still a challenging task. This is due to different phenomena, among which scale effects on cavitation and ship wake, confined environment and near field effects in model tests play an important role; the analysis of these problems is made difficult by the rather limited amount of available data from sea trials and to the complexities of the phenomena, most of which related to cavitation on the propeller blades, that are present in the measurements carried out in cavitation tunnels, depressurized towing tanks or circulating channels. In the present work, the subject has been studied with reference to a four blades conventional CP propeller of a coastal tanker. Cavitation tunnel tests have been carried out in two rather different facilities, at UNIGE cavitation tunnel and at SSPA large cavitation tunnel. Results from model scale tests processed with different treatments are then compared with full scale measurements performed by SSPA on the same propeller in terms of cavitation extension and radiated noise. The analysis is aimed at assessing the effectiveness of different experimental setups, testing procedures and scaling laws.",

      "abstract": "In noise mapping of urban areas main sources for nuisance and sleep disturbance are roads, railways, airports and industrial plants. However, when a noise analysis of port cities is carried out, also harbor activities are to be considered as significant contributors to the 'soundscape'. Within the harbor, ships, when berthed at wharfs and possibly busy in loading or unloading operations, represent significant sources of noise. In these conditions, in fact, some of the ship's plants are running and high airborne noise levels may be radiated. Ships are not traditionally characterized as noise sources and their dimensions and complexity pose a challenge for the description of the acoustical field in urban areas around the port. The work presents a hybrid experimental-computational approach for the acoustical characterization of ships applied to a test case represented by a multipurpose ship. For the same ship, the propagation field is studied numerically to include an urban area around the port. The same experimental campaign is also used to introduce a new measurement procedure for an effective characterization of the ship source.",

      "abstract": "In this work, the possible exploitation of fiber-reinforced composites in the context of maritime transportation of compressed natural gas (CNG) is investigated. In addition to a more conventional steel configuration, two different fiber materials, carbon and glass, are considered as construction materials for pressure vessels (PVs) to be stored on board ships, with thickness optimized by FEM analysis.The considered scenario is represented by the transportation of CNG from an offshore well to a terminal on shore. Fleets of ships carrying CNG in pressure vessels manufactured with the investigated materials are generated by means of a ship synthesis model (SSM) software and compared on the basis of technical and economical indicators.The choice of the construction material influences considerably the weight of the PVs, which represent a major item of total ship weight and reflects directly on the general transport performances in terms of resistance, seakeeping and reliability in the service. On the other hand, capital as well as operating expenditures are considerably affected by the choice. When exploring the design space, the ship synthesis model is able, at a preliminary stage of the design, to account for the various technical and economical aspects, their implications and relationships. Results are presented of computations carried out in a specific case, identified by the annual gas production and other characteristics of the well terminal and a cruising route for the ships. The comparison is carried out on the basis of the cost per transported unit of gas and of the percentage of success in the transportation process. The computations show that the choice of the PV material has a key influence on the results in terms of optimal number, dimensions and speed of the ships.",

      "abstract": "The sustainability of anthropogenic activities at sea is recently gaining more and more attention. As regards shipping, emissions from ships into the environment of various nature (engine exhaust gases, anti-fouling paints leaching, ballast exchange, releases at sea of oil and other noxious liquid or solid cargoes, of sewage and of garbage) have been recognized as sources of pollution and therefore controlled and limited since a long time. The subject of noise emission has been identified only recently. To study the problem, the EU has funded, among others, the FP7 SILENV (Ship Innovative soLutions to rEduce Noise and Vibrations) project that run from 2010 to 2012. In the present work, the holistic approach followed within the project to characterize and control the ship as a source of noise is presented. Three types of noise emissions (in air, in water and inside the ship) are analyzed highlighting peculiarities and different strategies adopted to characterize the source, the impact on the receiver and the possible solutions to set limits to the ship emissions. The project outcome included a socalled \"Green Label\": a set of new prenormative requirements defined for the three main areas mentioned above.",

      "abstract": "The present paper deals with the side effects of propellers cavitation, i.e. pressure pulses and radiated noise. These effects are gaining more and more importance for commercial ships for different reasons. Pressure pulses significantly affect comfort onboard, thus their reduction is of utmost importance for all ships carrying passengers. As regards the underwater radiated noise, in the last decade interest has shifted from navy applications to commercial ships, due to the concern for the rising background noise in the oceans. The propellers, generating noise directly in water, represent one of the main contributions to the overall underwater noise emitted from ships. Due to the complexity of the mechanisms of propeller noise generation, different complementary strategies have to be followed to properly analyze the problem, ranging from induced pressure pulses to broadband noise and cavitation. In the present work, part of the activities carried out in the framework of the collaborative EU FP7 project AQUO (Achieve QUieter Oceans by shipping noise footprint reduction, www.aquo.eu) are reported. The paper presents the investigations carried out on a specific test case represented by a single screw research vessel, which is analyzed with three different strategies: numerical calculations, model scale investigations and full-scale measurements.",

      "abstract": "The requirement of better workers' psychophysical health and the wish to guarantee a correct comfort also during work activities, induce to consider the presence of significant pure tones also for the working spaces. However, the current European legislation regarding professional exposure to the noise of the workers, and namely the EU Directive 2003/10/CE, does not take into consideration the possible presence of pure tones in working noise. The same lack can be noticed in the standard ISO 1999:2013. As regards seafarers, the reference codes are the International Maritime Organization (IMO) Resolution A.468(XII) for ships built before 1 July 2014, and Resolution MSC.337(91) for newer ships. While tonal components are mentioned in the first one, stating that, if these are \"obvious\", the ISO noise rating (NR) number should be also determined, in the latter and most recent IMO Resolution no reference to tonal components is present. Tonal components cause annoyance and, at the same time, they induce hearing damage and can alter the behavior of workers, with a potential risk for the safety of ships. In this study, noise measurements taken onboard different ships are analyzed in order to determine seafarers' work exposure to tonal components. The survey includes different work spaces. To assess the presence of tonal components in crew's work environments the methodology of environmental noise analysis, defined in the Annex B of Italian Decree D.M. 16/3/98, has been used, making reference to ISO 226:2003 for determining normal equal-loudness level contours. The method used in order to evaluate tonal components is well established for the environmental noise annoyance and therefore it can be operatively extended to the workplace noise exposure. Results show that the presence of tonal disturbing components is not sporadic and therefore worthy of further analysis and regulation.",

      "abstract": "A statistical analysis of noise can play an important role in evaluating the performances of an acoustic system working underwater. If the system is either placed on board a vessel or operates nearby passing ships, the noise radiated by the vessel can considerably reduce the performances of the system if it has been not designed to have enough robustness. In the paper, a statistical analysis of ship noise records measured at sea is presented. Noise data were recorded in the framework of the EU FP7 European project AQUO (Achieve QUieter Oceans by shipping noise footprint reduction). Aim of the analysis is to characterize the ship noise in terms of probability distributions and their high-order moments. Since the overall ship noise is known to be generated by a number of sources with peculiar spectral energy distributions, the vessel spectrum can change considerably with a variation in the operating conditions. This approach allows determining the dependence of ship noise statistical properties on the actual navigation condition. In addition, since the ship noise records were simultaneously recorded by a vertical array of three hydrophones, a further analysis has been carried out to determine the effect of the receiver depth, and, accordingly, of the propagation path, in the recorded signal.",

The final goal is to provide policy makers with practical guidelines and solutions, in order to mitigate underwater noise footprint due to noise radiation from ships. For a maritime area under consideration, mitigation solutions can be split into two categories: the first one is to reduce the underwater noise emission of the noisiest vessels sailing in the area, and the second one is related to ship traffic management. The present paper addresses the first type, and the purpose is to assess the efficiency of different mitigation measures, corresponding to the dedicated task 5.2 of AQUO Project. First, an overview of a comprehensive list of possible mitigation measures is presented. Then, study cases corresponding to reference vessels are defined and several mitigation measures are tested in order to give an estimation of the reduction of ship source level (underwater radiated noise). To achieve this task, different modeling techniques and experimental results from previous tasks of AQUO Project are used. Special care must be taken on the relative importance of the part of radiated noise due to internal machinery and engines, and the part due to propeller(s).

The noise measurements were performed at sea for three different ship's types. Each ship passage was characterized by a specific combination of propeller rotational speed and propeller pitch, allowing to investigate the variations of the radiated noise spectrum at different settings of the pitch-RPM combination law. Neglecting the low-frequency contributions, the focus is on the analysis of the broadband patterns in the range 100 Hz to 4 kHz A parameterization derived from a basic spectral pattern is adopted: the noise spectrum shape is approximated with a flat level magnitude up to a reasonable frequency followed by a logarithmic decay. An investigation of the relationship between the considered parameters and the actual ship condition is proposed along with a comparison with the predictions provided by classic Ross and Whales-Heitmeyer ship noise models.",

The main regulatory bodies at international level, in the last decade, have started to look into the problem with the aim of monitoring the environmental status of marine waters, in particular the acoustical aspects) identify the situations where the anthropogenic impact is most intrusive and study and promote future actions for its control and reduction. The present work reports about the development and validation of a simulation tool able to predict the noise field generated by a set of ships sailing in a specific area. The simulation is based on real traffic data derived from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) normally used to monitor shipping traffic and on specific data characterising the environment of the zone of interest. The tool is meant to provide the Regulator with a means to study the present situation (with on-line AIS data) and/or study the effectiveness of possible measures devoted to reduce the acoustical impact of shipping by design and/or operative requirements. Motivation, bases and characteristics of the developed procedure are described in the paper, where a first validation of the tool is presented on the basis of data regarding a sea area off Barcelona (Spain). Data include AIS records, environmental parameters and underwater sound levels surveyed by an hydrophone placed in the area. The work has been developed in the framework of the collaborative project AQUO (Achieve QUieter Oceans by shipping noise footprint reduction), funded by the European Commission within a call of the 7<sup>th</sup> Framework Programme dedicated to the assessment and mitigation of noise impacts of the maritime transport on the marine environment, coordinated topic 'The Ocean of Tomorrow'.",

      "abstract": "The continuous development of design tools and analysis procedures has allowed propeller performances to increase progressively during years following more and more stringent design requirements. High propeller efficiency and avoidance of erosive cavitation are considered nowadays basic requests for a well designed propeller. However this may not be enough to meet the requirements of high added value ships such as passengers ships, mega yachts, research vessels, naval vessels etc. These kinds of ship need a propulsion system not only with good efficiency but also with low levels of vibrations and noise transmitted inside the ship and with low underwater radiated noise. Moreover, the above mentioned ships often work in a rather wide range of operational condition. Actually, the possibility to operate at reduced speed regards almost all kinds of ships, due to the increasing attention to fuel consumption and exhaust gas emissions, and the related tendency towards slow steaming. Speed reduction may be obtained in different ways. In the case of ships equipped with CPPs, in principle it may be achieved reducing RPM at constant pitch or reducing pitch at constant RPM; the latter is usually preferred when a power take off is present. This results in working conditions far from design ones for the propeller; Cavitation and related radiated noise may increase significantly in similar situations, despite the speed reduction is felt to be generally beneficial for the purpose. In this work, the effect of different speed reduction strategies on cavitation and radiated noise is studied by means of cavitation tunnel tests of four CPPs including both single screw and twin screw configurations.",

      "abstract": "In the present study, full-scale noise levels measurements on board a Ro-Pax ferry have been carried out in various compartments of the ship, both in stationary conditions (navigation) and during manoeuvres. Noise levels have been surveyed in various categories of spaces located in all decks accessible to both passengers and crew, with the purpose of giving a complete and effective picture of the acoustic climate on board. The measured noise levels have been compared with current and proposed limits for working and living spaces, obtaining a clear identification of the most critical spaces on board the ship both in respect to acoustic comfort and noise exposure of crew during working hours. In cabins, different operating conditions for air conditioning have been tested, to analyse the specific contribution to annoyance of the ventilation noise, which turned out to be in many cases determinant. Transient conditions during manoeuvres entering and leaving harbours have been analysed by spectral time histories in cabins and public spaces close to the main propulsion plant and to bow thrusters. These situations correspond to considerably high levels, which may limit significantly operation during night time.",

      "abstract": "The growth of commercial activities in the Arctic region, in particular of LNG transport, due to the recent discovery of new gas fields, brought to the development of new researches in the area of ice loads for ship structures. To consider possible collisions with ice during a design phase, simulations are often realized by modelling icebergs as rigid, i.e. non deformable bodies. Results obtained this way may turn out to be too conservative as the ship structure needs to be designed in order to absorb the entire amount of the impact energy. This paper describes an attempt of getting more realistic results by carrying out a collision analysis where both ice and ship are modelled as deformable. A material model describing the mechanical properties of ice is implemented in FORTRAN, for use during finite element analyses of the impact (performed using the software Abaqus CAE). The mathematical model describing ice behaviour is selected among different models present in literature. The ice model is applied in a first case to a specific situation considering a spherical iceberg of given radius impacting the side of a specific ship. The problem is decoupled, following the NORSOK method, into the analysis of a deformable iceberg impacting a rigid ship side and the analysis of the ‘mirror’ situation (rigid iceberg against a deformable ship). For the latter case, reference is made to results available in literature. Outputs from the two analyses are coupled, assuming that the results, separately derived, can be jointly applied to the real case of an impact between two deformable bodies. The results obtained in this first application confirm that a significant part of the impact energy is actually dissipated by ice deformation, but they are still valid under the simplifying hypothesis of neglecting the contact interactions between the two deformable bodies. The implemented material model is however ready for being integrated in the FEM analysis to study the coupled problem.",

      "abstract": "The sound propagation at sea is a key point in the study of the impact of underwater noise on the marine fauna. In the case of ship noise, the evaluation of the transmission losses is particularly important also for the acoustical characterization of the ship as a source of underwater noise. In fact, measurements of underwater noise emissions from commercial ships are carried out at sea typically during sea trials. This means that measurements can be carried out in a different environment, therefore with very different boundary conditions that, if not properly accounted for in the evaluation of the transmission can lead to different results in terms of ship source noise levels. Several parameters influence the sound transmission at sea: frequency, water depth, sound celerity profile in the water column, bottom composition. When carrying out measurements, such parameters should be in principle known to interpret correctly the data. The present work investigates the effects that uncertainties on the environmental parameters have on the transmission losses that occur between the source (the ship) and the receiver (the hydrophone). The numerical investigation of the transmission losses is carried out by means of a ray tracing and a wave number integration code systematically varying the input parameters.",

For this reason, one of the fields on which research in this sector is focused on is the reduction of airborne and structure-borne noise transmitted inside the cabins. At present, the floating floor arrangement is commonly used on board in order to reduce the structural noise transmitted through floors. This special floor decouples the inner floor of the cabin from the load-carrying structure of the deck. In the present study, the performances of two floating floors with innovative de-coupling materials have been analyzed. The floors were tested in the condition of unloaded floor and loaded floor. Modal analysis techniques have been applied to understand the overall results obtained in terms of general indicators.",

      "abstract": "The problem of the impact of airborne noise emitted by commercial ships moored at quay is gaining attention by Regulatory Bodies. The question is often raised by citizens sending complaints to the municipalities of port cities in which the harbour is located inside the town. The problem may be even more important in the case of pleasure crafts accessing protected areas and mooring there. Limit levels for airborne noise emissions started therefore to be fixed in normative as well as contract requirements. In the light of what above, an effective measurement procedure to characterise the noise emissions from ships and compare them to limits plays an important role. The procedure needs to take into account aspects linked to the ship source characteristics (dimensions, complexity, directivity) as well as related to the surrounding environment, which is often represented by the shipyard where the ship is built. The latter aspect includes the presence of obstacles and reflecting surfaces around the ship, as well as significant components of background noise. The paper recalls the background of a measurement procedure that was defined within the project SILENV of the 7<sup>th</sup> Framework Programme specifically for the purpose of the characterisation of ships as airborne noise sources and reports a trial application of this procedure to a ship moored at a yard quay. Instrumentation used and data post processing are discussed, together with practical problems encountered and solutions found in order to carry out measurements.",

      "abstract": "A major source of the underwater radiated noise from ships is represented by propulsion systems and by propellers in particular. The main noise-generating mechanism within ship propellers is cavitation, associated to the growing and collapse of vapour bubbles resulting from the unsteady hydrodynamic pressure field generated on the blades. The control of propeller underwater radiated noise is therefore strictly related to the control of cavitation phenomena, which are responsible for a larger part of the radiation. The activity within work package 2 of the collaborative project AQUO (Achieve QUiter Oceans by shipping noise footprint reduction, www.aquo.eu) of the 7th FP of the EU focuses on this aspect, which is analysed both from the experimental and numerical viewpoint. The present paper reports motivations, aims and achievements of such activity in the first year of the project.",

      "abstract": "The transportation by sea of compressed natural gas is a very recent subject, prompted by recent changes in the perspectives of a possible economic exploitation of relatively small quantities of this hydrocarbon, available as by-product of oil extraction in off-shore fields. An automatic and integrated preliminary design procedure has been established to generate and evaluate feasible technical solutions for a trade of this kind. A first trial application has been carried out for a specific case, for which various feasible solutions corresponding to fleets composed of a different number of equal ships are generated. In the procedure, a parent hull shape is adopted in order to evaluate, through systematic variations of the main dimensions, all the elements necessary to perform the classical steps of the design spiral (like weight evaluation, buoyancy, trim and stability checks and motion resistance prediction) accounting for the mutual interaction between the various items. When possible and necessary, parts of the procedure have been calibrated with data from existing ships, in order to ensure realism in the predictions. This has been done with reference e.g. to the evaluation of weight items and in particular to hull weight. On the other hand, when setting boundaries to the range of variation in the ship dimensions, care has been given not to constrain the investigation domain only to existing dimensional ratios, but to let the procedure explore a wider range of solutions. A particular feature of the procedure is to include in the evaluation process the seakeeping performances in terms of added resistance in waves. This aspect interacts with the other part of the design process and influences the final outcome in terms of performance of the solution. The main implications of accounting for the increase in motion resistance are the capability of evaluating the reduction in the average speed, the corresponding reduction in the annual cargo delivery and the increase in fuel consumption (all aspects evaluated in respect to nominal conditions). The procedure, accordingly, is able to provide, in addition to several technical output identifying the various solutions (such as main dimensions, weight, power installed, seakeeping performances), indicators of the performances of the fleet in terms of annual cargo delivery, CapEx and OpEx, that can be used to rank the various solutions. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",

Different methods are available to assess accumulated fatigue damage at the wellhead. The method recommended by guidelines is the Full Predictive Approach, based on Finite Elements tools to simulate the behaviour of the system under the action of the external sea loads. The latter are modelled on historical data available for the drilling site. A variation of the method is represented by the Semi-predictive Approach which differs because the weather conditions are directly measured with buoys or radars during the drilling operations. In the Measured Response Approach, finally, the actual stress-strain response of the system is directly measured by sensors.

      "abstract": "In the last decade of the 20th century the continuous increasing of human activities in the ocean has focused the attention of local and international institutions on the underwater noise pollution due to shipping traffic. While for military purposes the topic of ship noise generation gained a fundamental role since the WWII, in the civil field only recently standards for ship noise measurements have been addressed and limits to the radiated noise have been developed in order to reduce the shipping impact on the marine fauna. In view of the enforcement of compulsory limits in the next future, the possibility of evaluating the ship noise spectrum at a preliminary design stage represents a significant topic. In this paper, with the aim of verifying the reliability of a selection of available empirical models for the ship radiated noise, a comparison of predictions with measured noise spectra for a small set of ships is carried out.",

      "abstract": "The ship as whole represents quite a complex noise source. The generated noise affects definitely people on board the vessel (crew and passengers, directly exposed to sound pressure levels) but third parties as well, which may be reached by airborne or underwater noise transmission from the ship: inhabitants of areas near the coastline and near ports, the marine fauna living in zones with intense maritime traffic). The threefold aspect of the acoustical impact of ships (internal to the vessel, external in air and in water) is covered in the paper, which identifies in each context the main sources of noise, the potential receivers and the transmission paths linking sources and receivers. The state of the art and new trends in the characterization of the sources are evaluated, as well as the means available to model the transmission of acoustical power along the various effective paths. The available means for charactering the perception by the receivers in the various contexts are considered, in order to assess the impact of the noise radiation. The more or less recent introduction of norms and requirements in the different fields are discussed and analyzed, in order to highlight the evolution of the societal concern about the ship noise impact on second and third parties of the maritime transportation process. Such concern justifies the undergoing process of further implementations in the normative framework. The trends of this evolution are finally discussed, with description and motivation of pre-normative proposals covering the three aspects above mentioned.

      "abstract": "The Marine Strategy Framework Directive has officially stated as soon as 2008 the anthropogenic noise due to shipping were to be mitigated. The policy makers, the yards and the ship owners still strongly rely on the expert studies and guidelines to find the appropriate methodology to assess and then mitigate the acoustic pollution impact shipping on the marine biota. To address this issue, the project AQUO \"Achieve QUieter Oceans by shipping noise footprint reduction\" (www.aquo.eu) started in October 2012 for 3 years. The AQUO project was built in the scope of FP7 European Research Framework. It involves 13 partners from 8 European countries, mixes academic experts, industry representatives from yard, classification society and other acoustic and bio-acoustic specialized bodies. Addressing the anthropogenic noise pollution into the marine biota is an increasing concern which is logically paired with the increasing commercial maritime traffic. The IMO itself has recently issued a first draft guideline, to be followed up during the next MEPC, addressing this matter. In parallel to the different achievements that are effective or in progress by standardization bodies or other delegated or assigned work group, the AQUO project aims to finally issue guidelines to be taken as methodological tools. The multidisciplinary team of this project aims to comply with expectations from the different stakeholders. First, an overview of the project is given. The objectives and the related project structure are detailed so as to better understand which axes are chosen and studied. Secondly, it is here proposed to share the recent outcomes of AQUO project. The current status of applied knowledge, related legal decisions as well as standards empowerment are essential to identify the remaining needs and consequent expected efforts. Drawing first the background rationales the noise footprint concept is then detailed. The process followed towards the main objective of mitigating the anthropogenic noise from shipping will be partly revealed and completed by the expected future work to be achieved by 2015.",

      "abstract": "This article covers the reliability assessment of the hull girder of a crude oil tanker, referring to a scenario in which the ship is exposed to sea loads after a damage to the bottom of the hull has occurred. A number of possible flooding configurations are examined, each one caused by a group of damage cases, characterized by different location and extent. Static loads, wave loads and residual structural resistance are determined for each damage case, with the objective of obtaining a prediction for the probability of the hull girder's failure. The various damage cases are compared to each other and unconditioned to derive the probability of failure extended to the ship's life due to a generic bottom damage.A probabilistic Bayesian Network model has been created to deal with these variables and with the dependency relationships existing between them. The results provided by the model are analyzed with the aim of identifying the parameters most influencing the problem. The work is intended to contribute to the development of a more rational treatment of accidental conditions in design structural requirements for ships. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

      "abstract": "The problem of noise annoyance on board ships has been addressed since a long time. The first document setting limits on onboard noise was the \"Code on noise levels on board ships\", issued by the International Maritime Organisation in 1981. More recently all the major Classification Societies introduced in their requirements the so called \"Comfort Classes\". They generally provide different ratings of the acoustic comfort of ships. The growing needs of passengers and workers for acoustical comfort on board pushed both Classification Societies and IMO to consider an update of limits and criteria for noise annoyance assessment. The normative framework in the field is therefore presently in an evolution phase. In the present work, a series of existing measurements of noise carried out on a set of Ro-Pax vessels is analysed and compared with the existing requirements and with the new proposals of the SILENV collaborative project (Ships oriented Innovative soLutions to rEduce Noise & Vibrations), funded within the 7th Framework Programme of the E.U. and running in the period 2009-2012. The comparison provides an indication of the possibility for shipbuilding to cope with the new requests in terms of noise performances, provided that such requests are inserted in the design process. Further efforts are needed similar to those already implemented to fulfill the present formulations of compulsory requirements and reflected in the measured values. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group.",

      "abstract": "The growth of the LNG shipping market in arctic seas, due to the discovery of new gas fields in Northern regions, is a main motivation for research in the area of ice loads for ship structures. The focus of the present work is on accidental loads due to collisions with icebergs. More precisely, the scenario investigated includes an impact between small size iceberg shapes (modeled as rigid bodies) and the side of a LNG ship (realized in two different scantling versions: DNV class notation ICE-1A and standard class). Numerical simulations of these collisions are carried out using the non linear finite element software ABAQUS. The paper discusses the approximations made in order to model the impact within the software ambient. The final output of the work is represented by graphs providing the damage levels in the structures (penetration of the colliding object) as a function of the mass and shape of the iceberg and of the ship speed.",

      "abstract": "The paper addresses the present regulatory framework regarding ship noise emissions both towards the internal spaces onboard and the external environment (in air and in water). A different level of development has been reached in the various areas for the definition of the needs for the noise control and for their implementation in a normative framework. This is due in part to the different point in time in which the different aspects were recognised to be relevant and therefore studied, assessed and regulated. The analysis of existing regulations is the basis for considering the present situation, on-going developments and possible future trends as regards the evaluation of ship noise impact on the various types of environment. The situation of the requirements developed for the maritime field appears to be in line with other fields of engineering as regards the definition of noise limits for the working environment, while the definition of comfort of living on board seems to be somehow lacking behind other fields, with possibility of taking advantage of their experience. Well established assessment procedures for external radiation in air appear to be not yet available and in this case a need for specific developments arises. Finally, for underwater noise emissions, there is availability of relatively well developed requirements, that however are not adequately correlated to the quantification of the effects of the noise emissions on the marine fauna. © 2012 Institute of Noise Control Engineering.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, a probabilistic model based on a Bayesian Network is presented for the still water bending moment acting on a tanker struck in a collision. The damage is assumed to occur along one side of the ship and is idealised by means of a rectangular hole leading to flooding of the breached compartments. The stochastic characterisation of the position and extension of the hole along the ship is derived according to two different probabilistic models found in literature. The results are not only compared in the light of the different features of the input probabilistic models but are also interpreted in terms of a ranking of the various situations according to their probability of occurrence, the magnitude of the generated load effect and the spatial correspondence between the maximum bending moment and the damaged area. The final goal is to provide information for the selection of accident scenarios and design values for this variable. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

      "abstract": "More frequent use of advanced types of structures with limited redundancy and serious consequences in case of failure combined with increased requirements to efficiency in design and execution followed by increased risk of human errors has made the need of requirements to robustness of structures essential. Further, the collapse of the World Trade Centre towers and a number of collapses of structural systems during the last 10 years has increased the interest in robustness. Typically modern structural design codes require that 'the consequence of damages to structures should not be disproportional to the causes of the damages'. However, despite the importance of robustness for structural design such requirements are not substantiated in more detail, nor has the engineering profession been able to agree on an interpretation of robustness which facilitates for its quantification. In this paper a theoretical and risk based framework is presented which facilitates the quantification of robustness and thus supports the formulation of pre-normative guidelines.",

      "abstract": "Airborne noise emissions from ships can be a significant source of annoyance. Therefore, it is important to accurately predict ship noise in order to get an effective environmental noise control in planning new ports, or in widening existing harbor, or in locating new mooring positions. To test the reliability of current commercial simulators in predicting the noise field from complex sources such as ships, in the present work the airborne noise propagation from two different vessels was modelled: a Multipurpose Ship and a Fishing Research Vessel. The development of the model for both ships was performed in five steps: acquisition of the input data; modelling of the ship in the sound propagation software; definition of the noise sources; model validation; output data generation. Simulated data were then compared with on field measurements. The obtained results rise some questions about the measurement techniques adopted to characterize the source levels and the validation data, the simplifications made on the ship surface and the typologies of sources utilized in the study. Future developments in numerical simulators are needed in order to better describe outdoor noise propagation from ships, taking into account the specific nature and complexity of such sources.",

      "abstract": "The rising concern about the environmental impact of ship noise on the marine fauna recently pushed national and international bodies to face the problem. In the last decade a few mass strandings of cetaceans due to sea trials of navy sonars (Frantzis (1998)), enforced the interest on noise pollution effects on marine mammals. The problem of evaluating the impact of underwater noise from ships is very complex due to the difficulties in characterising the whole noise chain (source, transmission path, receiver). Standards have been recently issued aimed at the measurement of underwater noise emitted from commercial ships. As regards the transmission path, problems are linked to the correct evaluation of the transmission loss which is influenced by many environmental parameters (water temperature, salinity, pressure, bottom composition etc.) which cannot be easily monitored during measurements. Finally the actual sensibility to noise of the marine mammals it is not completely known, especially for species belonging to the Mysticetes (Baleen Whales). These problems have been analysed in the SILENV collaborative project (Ships oriented Innovative soLutions to rEduce Noise & Vibrations), devoted to the holistic analysis of noise emissions from the ship [radiation inside the ship and outside (in air and in water)].",

      "abstract": "In the paper a numerical procedure developed in a Matlab® environment is presented, aiming at the definition of the main dimensions of a fleet of ships devoted to the transportation of a bulk cargo. The procedure is meant to provide preliminary indication in the initial phase of feasibility studies. The optimal dimensions are defined through a full factorial analysis. Relevant input data are information about the cargo to be transported (annual quantity, specific gravity, etc.), about the characteristics of the plants needed for cargo handling (weight, dimension, location on board) and about the route. The algorithm is based on a preliminary design modulus which provides solutions in line with requirements and preliminarily checked as regards basic trim and stability requirements. The analysis includes, on the specific geometry considered, an evaluation of the seakeeping performances of the ship in the sea area covering the transportation route. The influence of adverse meteo-marine conditions reflects into an increase in the consumption and in a decrease in the average speed as compared with nominal values (in calm water). The inherent increase in running costs and the need for an incremented net weight nominal capacity to increase the probability of satisfying the specifications in terms of annual actual transportation flow is accounted for. A first set of results is presented, regarding a possible trade of Compressed Natural Gas in the North Sea area.",

      "abstract": "The added resistance in waves is, from a practical viewpoint, a key issue when selecting the propulsive plant of ships. Despite the fact that normal sea conditions correspond very rarely to calm water, most of the optimisation work performed at a design stage on the hull and on the propulsion system of ships relates to the calm sea condition. The actual motion resistance due to real sea conditions is often accounted for by using simplified empirical coefficients: a sea margin of about 15 to 20% is usually taken into account for selecting the maximum continuous rating of the propulsion engines. On the other hand, an evaluation of the increase in the motion resistance of hulls in a seaway is available from comparatively well assessed computational procedures. Some linear strip theory computer programs have this feature, despite the intrinsic non-linear nature of the force under consideration. In the present work a frequency domain strip theory program (PDStrip) has been adopted for a systematic investigation on a family of ships with different dimensions and speeds. The ship is a gas tanker and all the hull geometries are derived by transformation of a parent hull. The paper briefly recalls the literature available on the subject of the added resistance and the basic elements of the theory adopted. Results are provided of a systematic variation in dimensions and in design speed of the ship. The output in terms of added resistance is used in conjunction with the IACS scatter diagram of North Atlantic for a statistical prediction of the average annual speed and fuel consumption.",

      "abstract": "Marine and offshore regulations about onboard noise are quite stratified and tangled, being issued by a number of international and national bodies. At the same time, many of the requirements are actually expressed in non quantitative terms and neglect parameters like noise spectra, low frequency pulsations or sound reverberation, which deeply influence the \"sound wellness\". Aim of this paper is therefore to improve present requirements by introducing more meaningful noise annoyance criteria. These new criteria should be at the same time able to better express the actual reactions to noise from crew and passengers and simple enough to be widely applied on board ships. Such enhanced criteria are derived from the noise rating methods provided to rate indoor background sound in the civil engineering context. The possibility to make use of these indicators in the naval field is analyzed and some recommendations for a proper application on ships are given.",

      "abstract": "To assess and to control the environmental noise due to the main noise sources, including ports, the European Directive 2002/49/CE introduced a tool for the acoustic planning: the Noise Strategic Mapping (NSM). In any harbor, NSM can be obtained by evaluating the sound field for each type of sound sources standing in the port area and by superimposing all noise contributions. The present paper suggests a method to achieve such acoustical analysis of port noise. The method has a general purpose and is implemented in four steps: definition of the vessels category; measurements to characterize ship as a noise source; modeling of outdoor noise propagation; map drawing. All these subjects are discussed in the paper and some specific recommendations to get at a successful noise mapping of ports are reported, too. In the end, limit values to keep under control the problem of noise pollution due to ships are proposed.",

      "abstract": "The evaluation of the acoustic impact of ships is a complex problem, involving not only different sources but also different kinds of receivers and transmission paths. The problem of health and comfort for crew and passengers on board has been considered since a few decades, leading to quite a structured and detailed framework of Norms and Requirements. On the other hand, only in recent years a growing attention has been devoted to air-borne noise emissions outside the ship, for which requirements are not present. Underwater noise emissions have, even more recently, gained attention for their potential interference with mammals' communications and with the sophisticated use such animals make of acoustic signals for interacting with their living environment. An aim of the present work is to review the state of the art in the three areas above identified outlining the differences in the specific fields as regards: the present knowledge of the phenomena involved; the accuracy of the models available for the description of noise propagation; the accuracy of the models available for the quantification of noise effects.",

Vessels for transportation are analysed from the viewpoint of ship design in terms of hydrodynamic, structural and plant optimisation, as well as from the perspective of construction, maintenance, operation and logistics. The exploitation of marine and coastal resources is covered in terms of fishing, aquaculture and renewable energy production as well as of subsea resources extraction. The characterisation of the marine environment is seen under the twofold perspective of providing reference loads and conditions for the design of means for the resources exploitation, but also of setting limits to the design in order to preserve the natural ambient and minimise the impact of anthropogenic activities related to both transportation and exploitation. Efficiency, reliability, safety and sustainability of sea- and Mediterranean-related human activities are the focus throughout the book. Sustainable Maritime Transportation and Exploitation of Sea Resources will be of interest to technical operators in the various areas involved (shipbuilding and ship-owner companies, research organisations, universities, certifying bodies), but will also serve as an updated reference work for government agencies and other institutional and educational bodies.",

      "abstract": "Advantages in the adoption of integrated systems on a ship's bridge are quantified with respect to a more traditional bridge layout. The study is performed by modelling the causation factor for a ship-to-ship collision scenario. The assessment is provided in terms of the probability distribution of the time required to the officer on the watch (OOW) to complete a foreseen procedure aimed at avoiding a collision with another ship. The time needed to identify and agree the evasive manoeuvre with the second ship is evaluated for the two layouts, considering also a probabilistic occurrence of disturbances distracting and delaying the OOW during the procedure. Bayesian networks are employed to model the scenario. A general increment of the reactivity of the OOW in the integrated bridge is seen, represented by a shorter time to complete the procedure and by a reduced probability of being interrupted. The overall effect is an increase in the time available to put into practice the manoeuvre itself and, eventually, to avoid the collision.",

The purpose of the investigation is to provide quantitative information on the uncertainties affecting the prediction of still water load effect to be possibly utilised in a reliability evaluation of the hull girder strength. The various sources of variability in bending loads are reviewed, then the attention is focussed on the influence of the uncertainties affecting the cargo weight distribution on board.

The attention is focussed on the progress towards the identification of reference scenarios able to clarify the content of the rules themselves. A clearer definition of reference environmental conditions, of the corrosion model and of failure modes are the fields where this trend is recognised. Less evident is the identification of scenarios for accidental conditions. After this first general analysis on the goals of rules, the evolution in terms of consistency of the formulations to the target is examined. Evolution trends in the definition of characteristic loads and strength values and of combination criteria are seen from a probabilistic and risk based viewpoint.

Weld thermal cycles recorded during welding have shown that thermal stability conditions could be reached in all investigated welding conditions. Substantial differences have been observed between the microstructures in base material and stir zone. In the latter, a large amount of very small (4 μm and less), round particles, totally absent in the base material, has been observed. The tensile testing revealed joint efficiencies of 100% for the yield strength and of around 95% for the UTS. Failure in tensile testing always took place outside the stir zone. The fact that high quality joints could be obtained in a wide range of parameter combinations indicates that the FSW process has the required robustness for industrial application to particle reinforced aluminium alloys.",

      "abstract": "The longitudinal strength of the hull girder is traditionally verified by linear superposition of still water (static) loads to wave induced (dynamic) loads. Belonging to the former class, gravitational effects are considered always as directed along the plane of symmetry of the ship, as the static equilibrium position corresponds to the ship floating with a neutral heel angle. This is not the case for a ship in a seaway, as the weight will act in reality along the instantaneous 'true vertical', which is not in general contained in the symmetry plane, due to ship motions. The actual direction of the weight force represents one of the non-linear aspects of the seakeeping problem, as the direction of one of the input external forces (weight) depends on the instantaneous roll angle (representing an output of the study). The present paper investigates the above subject, trying to quantify this retro-action effect with reference to the verification of the bending strength of the hull girder. The attention is focussed on the magnitude of the horizontal bending component generated by the inclined direction of the weight force as compared to the bending component induced by waves in the same plane (normal to the plane of symmetry of the ship). The subject is discussed on the basis of a linear seakeeping analysis, which is not able to model properly the non-linear aspects above recalled, but provides anyway as output an estimate of roll motions that can be used to evaluate in a qualitative way how large would be the horizontal load component due to weight, not accounted for in equilibrium equations. The statistical correlation between the wave induced bending load and roll angle is treated with the simplified assumption of a Gaussian joint distribution and a consistent model for the combination of horizontal and vertical bending components is established. The reference situation is chosen as corresponding to the extreme value of the vertical wave induced component, and distribution for the horizontal wave bending component and of roll motion are conditioned to the occurrence of such extreme value. This can be seen as an extension of Turkstra's rule for the combination of loads to the case of correlated loads. The stochastic model is applied in the evaluation of the hull girder reliability for a test case and the conditioned probability distribution of roll motion at the failure point is derived in order to discuss the influence of a possible inclusion of roll effects in the verification of the hull girder bending strength.",

      "abstract": "A second-level reliability analysis is carried out on a realistic case study, represented by a 150,000 DWT double-hull tanker on service on a North Europe - Persian Gulf route. The object of the investigation is the longitudinal strength of the hull girder subject to bending loads. The scope of the analysis is to evaluate different stochastic models for the load variables and various combination criteria for the static and dynamic load components. A reference period of one year is adopted in the analysis and, as regards the loading conditions, use is made of detailed records collected from the owner during the first year of activity of the ship. The collapse equation describes the failure mode due to pure vertical bending moment, considering the ultimate capacity of the hull girder in its `as-built' conditions. A FORM procedure is adopted to calculate the reliability index and failure point co-ordinates. The present work is intended as a first step for the set up of a second-level reliability procedure to be adopted in the calibration of partial safety factors formats for the verification of the longitudinal strength of ships. Values of the reliability index are obtained for an existing, typical and well designed oil tanker on a common route: such values can be used for future comparisons between different design solutions or practices.",

      "abstract": "The present study is a part of a wider research program dedicated to the set up of a procedure for the safety assessment of ship structures in general and in particular midship sections. The target is to define a procedure to be eventually routinely used for the calibration of partial safety factor formats in Rules requirements. This work focuses on the flexural behaviour of the hull girder subjected to extreme annual loads. The adopted model takes into account time varying loads (with a combination of the vertical and horizontal components of the wave induced bending moment) and static loads (still water bending moment). The total resultant bending moment is considered as a vector in the transverse plane of the ship and also the ultimate strength of the midship section is modelled as a function of the direction of the total loading bending moment. The reliability analysis is performed at a second level, with evaluation of approximate probability of failure and reliability index by means of FORM/SORM procedures. The results of computations performed on a double hull tanker and a bulk carrier are here presented: in the latter case, the inclusion in the model of horizontal components of load and strength has a significant effect, while in the former one the effect is negligible. This fact is explained with the different shapes in the curves which report the dependence of the ultimate strength of the midship section on the direction of the total loading bending moment. Depending on such a shape, a magnification or a reduction in the effects due to horizontal components is found, affecting the influence of such components on the final results. A conclusion of the study is that, at least for some ships, a proper modelling of horizontal components of bending load and structural response should be included in mid-ship verifications.",

      "abstract": "The paper presents a numerical procedure for the simulation of a marine propulsion plant in transient conditions: the model describes in detail the various elements of the propulsion system and the interactions existing between each of them. The thermodynamic behaviour of the main engine as well as of the turbocharger group is modelled, in order to predict not only the mechanical stress of the plant due to the transient conditions, but also the thermal stresses and working point of the compressor and of the turbine (pressure and temperature at inlet/outlet). As a fast application of the model, the case is considered of a twin screw vessel powered by two four stroke medium speed diesel engines with controllable pitch propellers. The simulations presented in the paper regard two transient manoeuvres of the ship: slam-start (from zero speed to full ahead) and crash stop (from full ahead to zero speed with a `full astern' command). The results of the simulations are compared with the available experimental data, regarding the time histories of the vessel speed, space run before a complete stop, propeller r.p.m. and shaft power, showing a good accordance. The procedure can be utilized to check the behaviour of the turbocharger group during a transient manoeuvre and to identify possible improvements in the ship control system or in the pitch-r.p.m. combination law to optimize the performances, in term of e.g. stopping space of the vessel or thermal and mechanical stresses of the plant.",

Geometric imperfections caused by fabrication processes heavily influence the critical pressure. In order to investigate the relationship between the collapse mechanism and the various types of imperfections affecting this kind of structures a series of experimental tests on scale models has been carried out. The dimensional parameters of the specimens have been selected in order to keep the instability phenomenon in the elastic range. At the same time numerical calculations simulating the experimental tests have been performed by finite element method. The geometrical defects measured on the specimens were introduced in the correspondent numerical models. A good agreement was found in the comparison between experimental and numerical results.
