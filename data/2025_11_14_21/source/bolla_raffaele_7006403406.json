      "abstract": "In order to satisfy the ethical requirements that are expected from upcoming 6G technologies, the knowledge of the power consumption ascribable to the applications and network functions is crucial to enforce a sense of responsibility and joint efforts towards value-driven sustainability. In this respect, this paper presents a modular, energy-focused prototype of the Management Data Analytics Function (MDAF), that represents the cornerstone of the Observability framework recently developed by the 6Green Project. Its main goal is to provide management data to upper layers (i.e., network and end-users/verticals). A 5G network was tested on both the User-Plane and Control-Plane; at the same time, said network was monitored by both the proposed MDAF and a common power monitoring solution: Scaphandre. Results show that the MDAF measures a higher power consumption than Scaphandre; the difference lies between 50% (when idle) and 4% (at the maximum offered load). This difference corresponds to the ”indirect” power consumption that the MDAF is able to ascribe to the containers/Virtual Machines (VMs) (i.e., the Network Functions (NFs)). The more accurate power consumption measurements of the single NFs is a first step towards the need to spread energy/carbon awareness to all the involved stakeholders.",

      "abstract": "5G delivers limitless mobile broadband capabilities, enabling extensive connectivity for various devices, including smartphones, sensors, and machines. Its most notable feature lies in its ability to facilitate instantaneous and highly reliable machine communications. Because of the rapid evolution of communication networks, innovative architectures such as Open RAN (O-RAN) have emerged, promising increased flexibility, efficiency, and sustainability. To realize the full potential of O-RAN networks, however, it is critical to understand their power consumption implications. In this paper, in order to understand the way O-RAN consumes energy, a comprehensive power consumption model is used. The study not only provides theoretical analysis but also incorporates a practical implementation of the architecture. For this, an algorithm is employed to determine a base monolithic architecture of O-RAN by the placement of Distributed Unit (DU) and Centralized Unit (CU) using available data of Radio Unit (RU) in France and Ireland. The research further explores the impact of different parameter variations in various Evaluation Scenarios (ESs) on the architecture. By conducting this thorough evaluation, this research provides valuable insights for researchers and industry practitioners to gain a deeper understanding of energy consumption patterns and derive ideas on how to effectively reduce power consumption in these networks.",

      "abstract": "Energy efficiency will be a crucial feature for the next mobile network generations (B5G and 6G). Therefore, in this paper, we have examined power management techniques to minimize the power consumption while not neglecting performance of the most power-hungry 5G Network Function (NF): the User Plane Function (UPF). A classical power management technique has been used herein: the low power idle. It allows power saving caused by putting the CPU to \"sleep\"(i.e., C<inf>x</inf> state) when not in use. Results show that, in most cases the deeper \"sleeping\"states are enabled, the more power is saved. This is especially true in the highest load scenario in which the power is more than halved as a result. However, results show that special care should be devoted to the enabling/disabling of the \"deepest\"sleeping state (C<inf>6</inf>) since the transitions from it to the active state (C<inf>0</inf>) (and vice versa) actually hinder the power savings. Finally, the performance (as in latency) has been also evaluated, results show no packet losses and small latency in all scenarios.",

This has also brought the increase in resource wastage and carbon emission. To this end, Edge Agility paradigm introduced by 6Green comes as a solution to distribute nodes across the edge-cloud continuum depending on demands. This is done by using enablers such as 'scale-to-zero', which exploits Kubernetes horizontal scalability, to better understand its impact on the energy consumption. This paper studies the connection between scaling pods from one to zero and vice versa and the power consumption of the CPU. Results show that scaling a pod to zero can decrease the CPU power consumption of the server by around 50 % for the application under test.",

By dematerializing US system functions and migrating them to the cloud, barriers related to hardware and localization are eliminated, enabling a more agile and scalable approach to medical imaging. This paradigm shift leverages virtual objects and composite virtual objects to intelligently manage and orchestrate physical and virtual components, optimizing system performance and meeting service requirements.",

      "abstract": "The emergence of 5G systems and beyond, along with state-of-the-art cloud and software engineering solutions, have brought to a radical shift of networking technologies with respect to the previous generations. However, the increased performance and flexibility have come at the cost of reduced sustainability, not only from an environmental standpoint but, in turn, affecting economic and societal sustainability as well. Infrastructure owners can introduce power management solutions in their datacenters, but the improvement is negligible unless tenant operating on top of the physical infrastructure are enabled and incentivized to customize their slices and their applications towards more energy efficient and carbon neutral profiles. For these reasons, the 6 G r e e n project has designed an Observability framework for estimating the energy consumption and the carbon footprint of an entire network slice, or of edge-computing applications attached to it. This paper highlights the rationale behind the 6 Green approach and provides a high-level description of the observability framework.",

      "abstract": "As mobile generations advance, blurring the lines between physical and digital worlds, the deployment of ultra-dense networks poses challenges in resource allocation and energy efficiency. This article revolves around the environmental sustainability of Fifth Generation (5G) and Beyond 5G (B5G) mobile networks as cloud-native technologies, highlighting the use phase. It aims to represent a monitoring, observability and analytical framework to devise a feature selection methodology within well-known monitoring tools, aligning with environmental sustainability objectives. Notable open-source monitoring applications (e.g., Kepler and Scaphandre) are employed to collect data on resource utilization and energy consumption for containers and physical servers. Dependence criteria indexes, Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) and Pearson, identify interdependencies among timeseries from different tools. Addressing challenges, the paper resolves inconsistent dataset lengths, highlights the Pearson-HSIC trade-off, and underscores the need for alignment in feature selection with compatibility to resource utilization. Key findings include Scaphandre's underestimation of memory impact on power consumption, Kepler's limitations in host metrics. Finally, the results enable the development of an anomaly detection mechanism.",

      "abstract": "We consider multiple bursty flows characterized by different statistical parameters and performance requirements, which generate packets that require some form of processing at the network edge. We model the processing resources as multiple servers that can be activated/deactivated on a longer time scale with respect to the packet dynamics. Packets awaiting service are queued in an infinite buffer, and the queueing model adopted is of the MX / D / C type; the flow dynamics is instead represented by a birth-death model on a much longer time scale. By exploiting a time-scale decomposition, we describe possible Call Admission Control (CAC) strategies that are based on a Stochastic Knapsack model over the space of flows that satisfy packet-level delay constraints. We compare a Complete Partitioning and a Complete Sharing CAC scheme in terms of energy efficient implementation.",

      "abstract": "Industry 4.0 is evolving towards new challenging applications with tight reliability constraints. While simulation tools for the characterization of the physical and radio features of production environments would be very useful, there is a lack of awareness about radio propagation in the presence of 5G technologies. In this context, this paper presents a simulator, based on the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) TR 38.901 report, able to describe the physical layer, channel model, and channel modulation applied in 5G. The simulator takes as input the physical characteristics of the considered area and the objects inside of it and provides, with a two-layered approach, the time series of Block Error Rate (BLER) values according to the simulated propagation paths in the presence of moving objects followed by a reliability analysis of the gNodeBs with respect to the user position computed through statistical and geometrical calculations. Through our simulator, we have discovered that the current 5G technology systems may not be sufficient to meet the high reliability demands in safety applications in Industry 4.0 systems. This finding emphasizes the need for additional solutions to enhance the reliability of 5G technology in industrial settings.",

      "abstract": "The availability of networks able to perform control and management operations at unprecedented speeds is a crucial achievement for supporting next-generation Industry 4.0 applications. In particular, the presence of humans interacting with moving objects calls for decisions to be performed at time scales such as to ensure achieving the specific requirements identified by standardization bodies for the industrial sector in Beyond-5G environments. Among these specific Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), network reliability must be carefully pondered to guarantee the safety of the human operators at any time while investing the proper level of resources. For this reason, this paper presents an optimization problem that finds the best set of redundant radio bearers for each User Equipment (UE) in the factory area while accounting for the resource usage. Such problem extends the current specification on redundant transmissions. Several heuristics have been designed to achieve the desired time scales that could not be fulfilled with an exhaustive search. Results show that the optimization algorithm and the heuristics provide the same outcomes in terms of selected bearers and loss rates, but the latter do so at significantly more stringent time scales.",

      "abstract": "The 5th Generation of mobile radio communication systems (5G) is paving the way to applications characterized by unprecedented performance levels. Thanks to technological paradigms such as Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) and microservices, applications and network services, including the 5G core itself, can be deployed where and when required across the cloud-edge continuum to deliver the proper Quality of Experience (QoE) to users on the move. Since deploying and scaling applications/network functions can cause a waste of network and computing resources and a growth of costs for network operators, specific tools are required to identify current resource demands to fulfil user needs while minimizing the footprint on the underlying hardware infrastructure. The Network Data Analytics Function (NWDAF) was conceived for monitoring the edge and the cloud and producing Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) accordingly, but actual implementations are still lacking. This paper presents the design and development of an NWDAF prototype to be integrated in the core of a 5G network, to provide useful data for the horizontal scaling of the cloud-native microservices composing the 5G core. Results show that the prototype causes negligible overheads on the overall 5G core performance, with CPU additional usages averaging 5.5%.",

      "abstract": "The Fifth generation(5G) technology moves a step forward from the previous generations by natively supporting vertical applications with real time and low latency requirements. However, the resultant increase of computing resources will cause a consequent increase in the energy requirement and an impact on the carbon footprint. To this end, it is of paramount importance to involve all the stakeholders leveraging on the 5/6G ecosystem, by making them aware of the impact of their applications and network services on the underlying hardware infrastructure and promote, through economic incentives, a new value chain that puts energy efficiency in the spotlight. To achieve this goal, monitoring tools are required to measure the performance and resource consumption at the infrastructure level and map it to the virtual images on top of it to infer the consumption ascribable to a vertical application or a network function. Specifically, this paper analyzes the resource and power consumption of a Kubernetes container, focusing on the breakdown of CPU usage, wakeups and power consumed by the individual kernel processes in the presence of traffic varying in load and composition. Experimental results compare an application by itself with its containerized counterpart and show that the latter requires much more time and effort to process data, and uses more resources compared to a stand-alone application.",

      "abstract": "The diffusion of the Fifth-Generation (5G) of mobile radio networks will be the main driver in the digital transformation towards a new hyper-connected society. In order to satisfy the stringent demands of 5G-ready applications over the limited resources available at the edge, scaling mechanisms become crucial to guarantee the performance levels envisaged for 5G. Such mechanisms must be able to automatically perform according to the real-time user demands, the availability of computing resources and the state of Network Functions (NFs) and applications. In this context, this paper proposes a deep learning model, based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), for the dynamic and automated orchestration of NFs. The novelty of this model is its independence from specific 5GNF implementations; this is due to the nature of the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) used in this work, which are related to both execution environment (standard 'black-box' KPIs) and standard 5G APIs ('white-box' KPIs). Results obtained on the orchestration of a Session Management Function (SMF) reach an accuracy of 97∼ 98% for the training and validation phases and above 95% for the deployed model, as well as higher overall accuracy by ∼ 5% and computational resource savings with respect to a threshold-based scheme.",

      "abstract": "One of the most relevant innovations brought by 5G technology within industrial environments is the possibility to deploy ultra-reliable low latency communication services enabling dynamic handling of critical situations, such as those involving fast control loops. However, the reliability levels offered by current 5G communication standards are limited to static configurations of up to two redundant channels. This design choice might be insufficient for use cases where extreme reliability and low latency levels are needed for relatively short time periods, as in the case of collaborative robot-human scenarios. In this paper, we explore the possibility of applying dynamic reliability in beyond 5G industrial environments by adaptive provisioning of multiple redundant communication channels, depending on the specific requirements of the involved applications. We refer to a hierarchical control framework consisting of a centralized element which coordinates multiple distributed ones that are designed to perform fast control operations and guarantee extreme low latency. In this framework, we propose to divide the industrial plant into multiple sub-areas each controlled by the distributed elements with the main target of reducing the computation times in determining the optimal communication channels to ensure reliability. An algorithm is proposed to solve this task and is evaluated in terms of its execution time as a function of the environment parameters by simulation. Main results provide quantitative insights on how to properly design the proposed distributed network framework by exploiting the new degree of freedom represented by the number of sub-areas and related distributed control elements.",

      "abstract": "Network softwarization has paved the way for 5G technologies, and a wide-range of (radically new) verticals. As the telecommunications infrastructure evolves into a sort of distributed datacenter, multiple tenants such as vertical industries and network service providers share its aggregate pool of resources (e.g., networking, computing, etc.) in a layered 'as-a-Service' approach exposed as slice abstractions. The challenge remains in the coordination of various stakeholders' assets in realizing end-to-end network slices and supporting the multi-site deployment and chaining of the micro-service components needed to implement cloud-native vertical applications (vApps). In this context, particular care must be taken to ensure that the required resources are identified, made available and managed in a way that satisfies the vApp requirements, allows for a fair share of resources and has a reasonable impact on the overall vApp deployment time. With these challenges in mind, this paper presents the Resource Selection Optimizer (RSO)- a software-service in the MATILDA Operations Support System (OSS), whose main goal is to select the most appropriate network and computing resources (according to some criterion) among a list of options provided by the Wide-area Infrastructure Manager (WIM). It consists of three submodules that respectively handle: (i) the aggregation of vApp components based on affinities, (ii) the forecasting of (micro-) datacenter resources utilization, (iii) and the multi-site placement of the (aggregated) vApp micro-service components. The RSO's performance is mainly evaluated in terms of the execution times of its submodules while varying their respective input parameters, and additionally, three selection policies are also compared. Experimental results aim to highlight the RSO behavior in both execution times and deployment costs, as well as the RSO interactions with other OSS submodules and network platform components, not only for multi-site vApp deployment but also for other network/services management operations.",

Along with the enabling technologies of its predecessor, namely edge computing and network slicing, AI will realize intelligent communication and networking, but at a high risk of severely increasing the demands on computing resources and the related carbon footprint. In order to avoid such a curse, this paper proposes an AI framework allowing to achieve tight proportionality between the workload produced by vertical applications and network slices, and the energy consumption induced in the infrastructure, and enabling beyond 5G stakeholders to become part of a green business model. The paper outlines a high-level architecture able to support the framework, as well as the role of the algorithms composing it.

      "abstract": "Digital services and digital service chains are the heart beating of the modern economy. Their composition involves several players, i.e., processes, software, devices, and many kinds of data exchanged among them. In such a scenario, it is important to guarantee data confidentiality, integrity, as well as authentication and authorization procedures between the communicating parties of a service chain. Cyber-security frameworks are explicitly designed for this purpose. They rely on the integration of different software modules, mutually interfaced to accomplish complex security tasks. Nevertheless, it is important to guarantee a high level of protection during data exchange among the modules. Currently, standardized authentication and authorization mechanisms are implemented through proprietary 'As-a-Service' products, but the deployment of a mature on-premise solution is still missing. To bridge this gap, this contribution proposes an authentication and authorization module that automatically protects the information flowing among the modules of cyber-security frameworks. It guarantees resource availability only to authenticated subjects. Thus, their operations are confined in what actions they are authorized for. The proposed module has been implemented and tested in a real cyber-security framework under development into the H2020 GUARD project. Experimental tests show that the proposed module enables authentication and authorization procedure delegation among GUARD modules, which eases their implementation, while maximizing the flexibility of the set of access control policies and an efficient protection of the services.",

      "abstract": "Beside increasing flexibility and programmability, the current network 'softwarization' trend is believed to be beneficial also in respect of energy efficiency, owing to the consolidation of resources made possible by virtualized networking components. However, the widespread use of general-purpose hardware may jeopardize energy saving, unless proper control strategies are put in operation. In this context, the paper addresses a 'smart sleeping' control problem, where computing resources in multi-core processors executing network functions are modelled as multi-server queues, and the number of active processing units (either physical or virtual) can be dynamically adjusted by parametric control over a time scale compatible with the long-term dynamics of the traffic flows that require processing. We show that, on average, up to 25% of processing capacity of a network node can be turned off in the presence of bursty traffic with low load without significantly affecting packet latency.",

      "abstract": "In order to fulfill the stringent requirements of 5G applications, measuring the performance of the VNFs composing the network slices is crucial to identify potential bottlenecks of the networks. However, since the VNF behavior is time varying and strongly depends on the infrastructure and hosting execution environment, the traditional traffic generators are not suited for the evaluation as their overhead, both in terms of deployment time and code complexity, may affect the results to the point of corruption. In order to overcome this issue, this paper presents a software traffic generator, based on TRex and executed in a VNF, which leverages on an automation framework to provide zero-touch as-a-Service active monitoring. Results show that the impact of this solution on the measured performance is negligible in terms of deployment time as well as required input lines.",

      "abstract": "Today, the digital economy is pushing new business models, based on the creation of value chains for data processing, through the interconnection of processes, products, services, software, and things across different domains and organizations. Despite the growing availability of communication infrastructures, computing paradigms, and software architectures that already effectively support the implementation of distributed multi-domain value chains, a comprehensive architecture is still missing that effectively fulfills all related security issues: mutual trustworthiness of entities in partially unknown topologies, identification and mitigation of advanced multi-vector threats, identity management and access control, management and propagation of sensitive data. In order to fill this gap, this work proposes a new methodological approach to design and implement heterogeneous security services for distributed systems that combine together digital resources and components from multiple domains. The framework is designed to support both existing and new security services, and focuses on three novel aspects: (i) full automation of the processes that manage the whole system, i.e., threat detection, collection of information and reaction to attacks and system anomalies; (ii) dynamic adaptation of operations and security tasks to newest attack patterns, and (iii) real-time adjustment of the level of detail of inspection and monitoring processes. The overall architecture as well as the functions and relationships of its logical components are described in detail, presenting also a concrete use case as an example of application of the proposed framework.",

DDoS attacks are currently on the rise due to the ease of execution and rental of distributed architectures such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud infrastructures, which could potentially result in substantial revenue losses. Therefore, the detection and prevention of DDoS attacks are currently topics of high interest. In this study, we use traffic flow information to determine if a specific flow is associated with a DDoS attack. We used traditional Machine Learning (ML) methods in developing our DDoS detector and applied an exhaustive hyperparameter search to optimize their detection capability. Using lightweight approaches is suitable for resource-constrained environments such as IoT to reduce computing overhead. Our evaluation shows that most algorithms provide satisfactory results, with Random Forests achieving as high as 99% of detection accuracy, which is similar to the performance of current deep learning solutions for DDoS detection.",

      "abstract": "Today's networks and services undoubtedly require a high level of protection from cyber threats and attacks. State-of-the-art solutions that implement Machine Learning (ML) have shown to improve the accuracy and confidence in threat detection compared to previous approaches, making it suitable for detecting today's sophisticated attacks such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS). However, in real-world deployments, input data streams take large bandwidth and processing capacity, especially for Deep Learning (DL) solutions that require extensive input data. On the other hand, deployment environments usually have limited bandwidth and computing resources, such as in the Internet of Things (IoT). Thus, a lightweight detection solution that satisfies such constraints is needed. In this paper, we utilize a feature reduction approach for our DL-based DDoS detector based on the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), which is used to identify important data features and reduce the data inputs needed for detection. Our result shows that we can reduce the data input needed by up to 84.21% while only reducing 0.1% detection accuracy. We also provide a detailed analysis of the characteristics of DDoS attacks using ANOVA and compared our work with recent DL-based DDoS detection systems to demonstrate that our results are comparable to existing approaches.",

      "abstract": "Since the adoption of virtualization paradigms is seen as a viable way to fulfil the requirements of next-generation applications in a sustainable way, this paper examines the virtualization of the Radio Access Network (RAN), focusing on the C-RAN architecture, in order to better understand the impact of NFV technologies on power consumption and costs in real networks. The evaluation compares the power consumption obtained by deploying the Base Band Unit (BBU) using commercial devices or pools of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs). Publicly available datasets describing the traffic and the eNodeBs have been used for the evaluation, as well as datasheets for both the commercial devices and the VNF pools. Results show that the usage of the virtualized BBU causes consumptions around 250% higher with respect to the commercial deployment, and operation and capital costs over 66% higher, contradicting the common belief of NFV being a 'green' technology. Further estimates conducted in this paper, however, highlight how the deployment of VNFs alongside specialized hardware solutions can represent a successful approach for telecom providers, with energy savings up to 20% and costs in line with the ones of dedicated hardware deployments.",

      "abstract": "The new generation of digital services are natively conceived as an ordered set of Virtual Network Functions, deployed across boundaries and organizations. In this context, security threats, variable network conditions, computational and memory capabilities and software vulnerabilities may significantly weaken the whole service chain, thus making very difficult to combat the newest kinds of attacks. It is thus extremely important to conceive a flexible (and standard-compliant) framework able to attest the trustworthiness and the reliability of each single function of a Service Function Chain. At the time of this writing, and to the best of authors knowledge, the scientific literature addressed all of these problems almost separately. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a novel methodology, properly tailored within the ETSI-NFV framework. From one side, Software-Defined Controllers continuously monitor the properties and the performance indicators taken from networking domains of each single Virtual Network Function available in the architecture. From another side, a high-level orchestrator combines, on demand, the suitable Virtual Network Functions into a Service Function Chain, based on the user requests, targeted security requirements, and measured reliability levels. The paper concludes by further explaining the functionalities of the proposed architecture through a use case.",

      "abstract": "Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) has recently gained much popularity in the research scene for the flexibility and programmability that it will bring with the software implementation of network functions on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware. To substantiate its roll out, a number of issues (e.g., COTS' inherent performance and energy efficiency, virtualization overhead, etc.) must be addressed, in a scalable and sustainable manner. Numerous works in the scientific literature manifest the strong correlation of network key performance indicators (KPIs) with the burstiness of the traffic. This paper proposes a novel model-based analytics approach for profiling virtualized network function (VNF) workloads, towards real-time estimation of network KPIs (specifically, power and latency), based on an M<sup>X</sup>/G/1/SET queueing model that captures both the workload burstiness and system setup times (caused by interrupt coalescing and power management actions). Experimental results show good estimation accuracies for both VNF workload profiling and network KPI estimation, with respect to the input traffic and actual measurements, respectively. This demonstrates that the proposed approach can be a powerful tool for scalable and sustainable network/service management and orchestration.",

      "abstract": "5G is designed to leverage on network softwarization technologies, like NFV and MEC, to expose customized network instances and resources at the edge of the infrastructure to vertical stakeholders. Most of the 5G success will depend on the ability to attract vertical stakeholders acting in the cloud, enabling them to smoothly port cloud applications to 5G, and to add performance and cognitive capabilities not supported in cloud environments. To this end, this article provides an insight into the possible architectural approaches to fully integrate vApps into the 5G infrastructure. The article follows a top-down approach. First, it provides an outlook on the state of the art in cloud application design, and on the new MEC and NFV capabilities. Then, on this basis, the analysis is devoted to identifying integration issues not yet fully addressed in standards specifications. Two alternative architectural approaches are discussed.",

      "abstract": "The Internet of Things paradigm will certainly be one of the main drivers of the tomorrow's 5th generation (5G) wireless networks. In order to support the algorithms required for real time exchange and analysis of great amounts of data among the involved smart devices, Virtual Objects (VO) have become a key component to improve the objects energy management efficiency, as well as to address heterogeneity and scalability issues. Following the research trend of exploiting on-demand cloud computing resources to augment the processing and storage capabilities of IoT devices, this paper addresses the design of a novel infrastructure and paradigm to support the deployment of new personal IoT services inside the infrastructure provider premises. The goal is to bring cloud-computing services much closer to the end-users and to be able to replace physical IoT devices with their “Virtual Images”. Among other benefits, this approach will ensure a longer lifetime to IoT constrained devices and enable the inclusion of new protocols making the development of logic and the configuration of IoT smart application environment technology-agnostic. To achieve this goal, we have developed an open-source software platform that exploits OpenStack APIs and leverages a web interface providing all the functionality typically available in a home gateway through the OpenWRT Linux distribution. Results show this approach brings a manifest reduction in the amount of data transmitted, with benefits in terms of reduced workload and power consumption as well as extended device lifetime.",

      "abstract": "An implementational model for the energy analyst to use in segmentation of the metropolitan area of telecommunications networks is proposed. The model is built to address the problem of inconsistent modelling in the energy literature (literature that contributes to knowledge about energy absorption in large public networks). Two aspects of this problem are dealt with. Firstly, existing models are classified in ascending order of resolution. Within each class, the models are reconciled where possible but otherwise filtered according to where the mass of substantial agreement lies. Secondly, we describe the models using reference points for interconnection to strike a balance between abstraction and implementation. We further address this need for balance through emphasis on the transport function of the network. To facilitate the model's use, we develop it in accordance with frameworks defined in international standards and recommendations. We consolidate reference points for interconnection from standards into a recognizable template that can be applied to simplify cross-comparison of analyses that adhere to the template. In doing so, we give an example of how such reference points can be used to eradicate inconsistency.",

      "abstract": "Edge computing is an effective paradigm for proximity in computation, but must inexorably face mobility issues and traffic fluctuations. While software orchestration may provide effective service handover between different edge infrastructures, seamless operation with negligible service disruption necessarily requires pre-provisioning and the need to leave some network functions idle for most of the time, which eventually results in large energy waste and poor efficiency. Existing consolidation algorithms are largely ineffective in these conditions because they lack context, i.e., the knowledge of which resources are effectively used and which ones are just provisioned for other purposes (i.e., redundancy, resilience, scaling, migration). Though the concept is rather straightforward, its feasibility in real environments must be demonstrated. Motivated by the lack of energy-efficiency mechanisms in cloud management software, we have developed a set of extensions to OpenStack for power management and Quality of Service, explicitly targeting the introduction of more context for applications. In this paper, we briefly describe the overall architecture and evaluate its efficiency and effectiveness. We analyze performance metrics and their relationship with power consumption, hence extending the analysis to specific aspects that cannot be investigated by software simulations. We also show how the usage of context information can greatly improve the effectiveness of workload consolidation in terms of energy saving.",

      "abstract": "Evolving business models, computing paradigms, and management practices are rapidly re-shaping the usage models of ICT infrastructures, and demanding for more flexibility and dynamicity in enterprise security, beyond the traditional \"security perimeter\" approach. Since valuable ICT assets cannot be easily enclosed within a trusted physical sandbox any more, there is an increasing need for a new generation of pervasive and capillary cyber-security paradigms over distributed and geographically-scattered systems. Following the generalized trend towards virtualization, automation, software-definition, and hardware/software disaggregation, in this paper we elaborate on a multi-tier architecture made of a common, programmable, and pervasive data-plane and a powerful set of multi-vendor detection and analysis algorithms. Our approach leverages the growing level of programmability of ICT infrastructures to create a common and unified framework that could be used to monitor and protect distributed heterogeneous environments, including legacy enterprise networks, IoT installations, and virtual resources deployed in the cloud.",

      "abstract": "The Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) paradigm is undoubtedly a key technological advancement in the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) community, especially for the upcoming 5G network design. While most of its promise is quite straightforward, the implied reduction of the power consumption/carbon footprint is still debatable, and not in line with the energy efficiency perspective forecasted by the ETSI NFV working group (WG). In this paper, we provide an estimate of the possible future requirements of this upcoming technology when deployed according to the virtual Evolved Packet Core (vEPC) use case specified by the ETSI NFV WG. Our estimation is based on real performance levels, certified by independent third-party laboratories, and datasheet values provided by existing commercial products for both the legacy and NFV network architectures, under different deployment scenarios. Obtained results show that a massive deployment of the current NFV technologies in the EPC may lead to a minimum increase of 106 % in the carbon footprint/energy consumption with respect to the Business As Usual (BAU) network solutions. Moreover, these values tend to increase at a very high pace when the most suitable software/hardware combination is not applied, or when packet processing latency is taken into account.",

      "abstract": "Several studies in the last decade have pointed out that many devices, such as computers, are often left powered on even when idle, just to make them available and reachable on the network, leading to large energy waste. The concept of network connectivity proxy (NCP) has been proposed as an effective means to improve energy efficiency. It impersonates the presence of networked devices that are temporally unavailable, by carrying out background networking routines on their behalf. Hence, idle devices could be put into low-power states and save energy. Several architectural alternatives and the applicability of this concept to different protocols and applications have been investigated. However, there is no clear understanding of the limitations and issues of this approach in current networking scenarios. This paper extends the knowledge about the NCP by defining an extended set of tasks that the NCP can carry out, by introducing a suitable communication interface to control NCP operation, and by designing, implementing, and evaluating a functional prototype.",

      "abstract": "The idea of proxying network connectivity has been proposed as an efficient mechanism to maintain network presence on behalf of idle devices, so that they can 'sleep.' The concept has been around for many years; alternative architectural solutions have been proposed to implement it, which lead to different considerations about capability, effectiveness and energy efficiency. However, there is neither a clear understanding of the potential for energy saving nor a detailed performance comparison among the different proxy architectures. In this paper, we estimate the potential energy saving achievable by different architectural solutions for proxying network connectivity. Our work considers the tradeoff between the saving achievable by putting idle devices to sleep and the additional power consumption to run the proxy. Our analysis encompasses a broad range of alternatives, taking into consideration both implementations already available in the market and prototypes built for research purposes. We remark that the main value of our work is the estimation under realistic conditions, taking into consideration power measurements, usage profiles, and proxying capabilities.",

      "abstract": "Overcoming the typical ossification of the traditional TCP/IP-based Internet infrastructure will allow opening the way for more flexible and energy efficient paradigms, able to provide a sustainable support to the constantly increasing number of devices and services. To this goal, the INPUT Project will overcome current limitations by introducing computing and storage capabilities to edge network devices in order to allow users/telecom operators to create/manage private clouds «in the network». In addition, these new capabilities will allow replacing smart devices, such as network-attached storage servers, set-top-boxes, video sensors etc. with their virtual images. Although this virtualization process can clearly bring to a reduction of the emissions, along with the lowering of capital (CAPEX) and operational (OPEX) expenditures, on the other hand it requires more computational capacity at server level, which may erase the savings produced by virtualization in the absence of a thorough management and planning. In this respect, this paper presents a mathematical model that analyzes the impact of different levels of virtualization on the overall energy efficiency by thoroughly outlining how the carbon footprint varies depending on the virtualization level of a device.",

The demonstrator reproduces a complete wire-line network chain from the core devices to the subscriber terminals, integrating quite a few green mechanisms able to interoperate efficiently and achieve significant reductions in energy consumption.

We set up a complex test-bed that allowed us to perform a large number of measurements of energy-And network-performance indexes on a general-purpose computing system with power management capabilities, and the Linux operating system. The performed measurements gave us a chance not only 1) to provide a complete energy profiling of TCP connections, but also 2) to analyze the role of underlying network protocols in detail, and 3) to identify specific situations where current network protocols may trigger high inefficiencies in networked hosts. Based on the obtained results, we also conducted further experiments for evaluating techniques for reducing the energy consumption induced by TCP data transfers under different scenarios.",

The main implication of this fact is that such devices are often left fully powered yet idle just to maintain their network presence, hence leading to large energy waste. This ultimately results in higher electricity cost for consumers. This paper tackles an effective mechanism to reduce energy waste of consumer electronics, by boosting the usage of lowpower states available in most devices. The main concept is to delegate background networking routines to home gateways, which are today available in most homes and offices. The paper describes the functionality and the software architecture to be implemented by home gateways and consumer electronics, reports performance evaluation on a working prototype, and provides estimation of potential benefits for consumers.",

      "abstract": "The continuing increase in demand for online and cloud services as well as the development of new more resource-intensive applications poses a significant challenge to the network infrastructure. The resulting rise in energy costs and ecological considerations have made it apparent that a future network infrastructure needs to be as energy efficient as possible, while at the same time flexible enough to handle the ever-changing traffic demands it is exposed to. This requires a flexible adaption of resources in the network devices themselves - the power management primitives - as well as a network-wide optimization of traffic loads. Software defined networking provides a way to introduce this flexibility into the network. This chapter illustrates how both approaches can be integrated to form an energy-efficient network management system.",

      "abstract": "The constant evolution and expansion of the Internet and Internet-related technologies has exposed the limitations of the current networking infrastructures, which are represented by the unsustainable power consumption and low level of scalability. In fact, these infrastructures are still based on the typical, ossified architecture of the TCP/IP paradigm. In order to cope with the Future Internet requirements, recent contributions envisage an evolution towards more programmable and efficient paradigms. In this respect, this paper describes the basic issues, the technical approaches, and the methodologies for the implementation of power management primitives in the context of the emerging Software Defined Networking. In detail, we propose to extend one of the most prominent solutions aimed at increasing networking flexibility, the OpenFlow Protocol, to integrate the energy-aware capabilities offered by the Green Abstraction Layer (GAL). However, the mere introduction of node-level solutions would be of little or no use in the absence of a network-wide management scheme to guarantee inter-operability and effectiveness of the proposed architecture. In this respect, this work also proposes an analytical model for the management of a network with these capabilities. The results will show how our solutions are well suited to provide a scalable and efficient network architecture able to manage the orchestration and consolidation of the available resources.",

      "abstract": "Smartphones have undergone a remarkable evolution over the last few years, from simple calling devices to full fledged computing devices where multiple services and applications run concurrently. Unfortunately, battery capacity increases at much slower pace, resulting as a main bottleneck for Internet connected smartphones. Several software-based techniques have been proposed in the literature for improving the battery life. Most common techniques include data compression, packet aggregation or batch scheduling, offloading partial computations to cloud, switching OFF interfaces (e.g., WiFi or 3G/4G) periodically for short intervals etc. However, there has been no focus on eliminating the energy waste of background applications that extensively utilize smartphone resources such as CPU, memory, GPS, WiFi, 3G/4G data connection etc. In this paper, we propose an Application State Proxy (ASP) that suppresses/stops the applications on smartphones and maintains their presence on any other network device. The applications are resumed/restarted on smartphones only in case of any event, such as a new message arrival. In this paper, we present the key requirements for the ASP service and different possible architectural designs. In short, the ASP concept can significantly improve the battery life of smartphones, by reducing to maximum extent the usage of its resources due to background applications.",

In order to promote a viable evolution towards new protocols and paradigms, modern network routers should become programmable to allow a flexible management of both traffic flows and power states. In this respect, Software Defined Networking (SDN) can represent the perfect support for the allocation of traffic flows and, at the same time, the management of the power states of the single nodes. To this purpose, this paper proposes to use the Green ion Layer (GAL) to integrate the exchange of power management data among network elements and the application of control strategies inside the SDN paradigm. Moreover, in order to clarify how our study would help overcoming scalability issues and promote energy efficiency at the same time, this paper defines and solves a consolidation problem where the network is described in terms of allocation of packet handling resources and power states.",

We assume a Forwarding Engine (FE) whose power can be scaled through Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) and Clock Gating (CG). In a typical architecture, data packets are always transferred at the maximum speed consuming the maximum power. We proposed to tradeoff energy efficiency and forwarding performance of the FE by acting on the power-delay product. To this purpose, we provide an optimization framework for dynamically adjusting the capacity of single server queuing system. Then, we design a practical AR policy, which can be easily extended for multi-core/multi-processor architectures. The performance evaluation revealed that a significant power reduction is experienced when using our policy, with a small increase of packet delays during low traffic condition and without compromising performance during peak hours.",

      "abstract": "This paper focuses on the energy efficiency of network-attached home devices, like PCs, tablets, and set-top boxes. These devices already include sophisticated power management schemes, which usually provide a good proportionality level between energy consumption and workload. However, they may become very inefficient in the presence of network-intensive applications and common residential access scenarios (e.g., DSL). As outlined by the experimental results obtained, the origin of this inefficiency fundamentally resides in the gap between (fast) working speeds of power management schemes, and (too slow) network packet inter-arrival times due to the limited bandwidth commonly deployed in residential access. Starting from these considerations, we designed, developed, and experimentally evaluated a simple traffic shaping mechanism, Burst2Save, aimed at mitigating this gap. The Burst2Save allows reducing the energy consumption induced by the network dynamics up to about an order of magnitude without affecting the Quality of Experience (QoE) of end-users under common realistic scenarios. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

      "abstract": "Multi-core processors optimized for networking applications typically combine general-purpose cores with offloading engines to relieve the processor cores of specialized packet processing tasks, such as parsing, classification, and security. Unfortunately, modern embedded operating systems still lack an effective and advanced hardware abstraction to exploit these aspects optimally. Based on these considerations, this paper proposes a novel framework, OpenFlow in the Small (OFiS), specifically designed to provide a flexible hardware abstraction layer for heterogeneous multi-core systems with advanced hardware accelerators for network offloading. OFiS represents such accelerators as standard OpenFlow switches inside the processor, moving the edge of the OpenFlow network management to the computational resources inside the end-boxes. As indicated in the experimental evaluation, OFiS exploits hardware parallelism and consolidates the software tasks at finer granularities.",

      "abstract": "Personal communication devices are extensively used for mobile computing thanks to ever increasing wireless coverage and processing capability. However, they are constrained in terms of both human interaction (screen size and resolution, keyboard) and lifetime; hence mobile computing often relies on the possibility to migrate applications and communication sessions among several (fixed or mobile) devices. Session migration is a challenging feature, especially when communication with other hosts is involved, and the current Internet architecture does not support natively this paradigm. In this paper, we address seamless and transparent session migration for the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) that maintains compatibility with current Internet; hence, our work keeps the remote TCP peer unaware of the migration process. We describe the latest features of the Linux kernel that allow the migration of a TCP session and a couple of aLTErnatives to divert network packets towards the new destination.",

Our main objective is to evaluate and to model the impact of power saving mechanisms, generally included in today's COTS processors, on the SR networking performance and behavior. To this purpose, we separately characterize the roles of both hardware and software layers through a large set of internal and external experimental measurements, obtained with a heterogeneous set of hardware platforms and SR setups. Starting from this detailed measure analysis, we propose a simple model, able to represent the SR performance with a high accuracy level in terms of packet throughput and related power consumption. The proposed model is thought to estimate how SRs behave under different network conditions and power management configurations. In fact, the model has been effectively applied inside a \"green optimization\" policy, which aims at minimizing power consumption, while maintaining a certain SR performance target. Finally, in order to provide an experimental evaluation of the proposed ideas, we apply such power management policies to a new generation software router platform, and we test their performance under real traffic traces. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

      "abstract": "With the aim of controlling power consumption in metro/transport and core networks, we consider energy-aware devices able to reduce their energy requirements by adapting their performance. In particular, we focus on state-of-the-art packet processing engines, which generally represent the most energy-consuming components of network devices, and which are often composed of a number of parallel pipelines to 'divide and conquer' the incoming traffic load. Our goal is to control both the power configuration of pipelines and the way to distribute traffic flows among them. We propose an analytical model to accurately represent the impact of green network technologies (i.e., low power idle and adaptive rate) on network- and energy-aware performance indexes. The model has been validated with experimental results, performed by using energy-aware software routers loaded by real-world traffic traces. The achieved results demonstrate how the proposed model can effectively represent energy- and network-aware performance indexes. On this basis, we propose a constrained optimization policy, which seeks the best tradeoff between power consumption and packet latency times. The procedure aims at dynamically adapting the energy-aware device configuration to minimize energy consumption while coping with incoming traffic volumes and meeting network performance constraints. In order to deeply understand the impact of such policy, a number of tests have been performed by using experimental data from software router architectures and real-world traffic traces. © 2013 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Current mobility protocols and architectures are mainly targeted to devices or applications and they usually lack the ability to support user-centric paradigms; moreover, they usually face a single aspect of the problem, i.e., terminal handover or session mobility. Full mobility support is only available to specific applications or protocols (e.g., SIP) but these approaches do not exploit all facilities for movement detection at the network/link layers and do not allow to use the same framework for different applications. This paper proposes a generic mobility framework for terminal handover and session migration. It pursues the user-centric paradigm and builds a cross-layer architecture, yielding to a high level of generality, applicability and flexibility. Unlike other approaches, it does not require any modification in correspondent peers and works with a minimal network infrastructure. Software implementations are described for two representative real-time multimedia applications, i.e., media streaming and interactive conference. The effectiveness of the framework was analyzed by means of both performance measurements in local and Internet testbeds and user evaluation during a live demo conducted at a national science exhibition. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",

Mobility management is a key issue in this context. The original IP specification does not account for mobility. Nevertheless, since the beginning of the Internet there has been a continuous interest in managing nomadic hosts; this has brought to a large number of approaches and protocols that have faced the problem from different perspectives.

      "abstract": "Recently, a number of approaches based on dynamic power management techniques have been proposed to reduce the energy consumption of telecommunication networks and devices. They are able to optimize the trade-off between network performance and energy requirements. It is possible to execute and extend these techniques to the whole network, by using local control policies together with energy-aware routing and traffic engineering. However, the lack of a standardized representation of the energy-aware capabilities of heterogeneous networking equipment makes their deployment confusing and impractical. To this aim, we have proposed a novel framework, the green abstraction layer (GAL), whose purpose is to define a multi-layered abstraction interface for the hardware and physical resources, where energy management actions are directly performed. Therefore, the GAL syntax can be exposed to the platform-independent logical representation commonly used in network control protocols. Given the internal architectural complexity and heterogeneity of many network devices, the GAL approach is based on a hierarchical decomposition, where each level provides an abstract and aggregated representation of internal components. © 1979-2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "We propose an analytical model able to accurately estimate both power consumption and network performance indexes of Energy Efficient Ethernet (EEE) links working at the three available speeds under various traffic load patterns and packet size distributions. The model is sufficiently flexible and accurate to consider different traffic parameters; among others, the packet size distribution, the average burst inter-arrival rate, the burst size distribution, etc. With relatively low complexity, since it addresses stationary queue behavior, the analysis allows obtaining the average energy consumption of the link and, unlike previous works, the mean latency time experienced by incoming packets in closed form, without any upper or lower bound approximations. This aspect makes the model suitable to be adopted in optimization frameworks for network design and control purposes. The numerical results of the model are validated against measurements on a real test bench. © 2013 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Dynamic power management techniques have been proposed in a number of recent approaches to reduce the energy consumption of telecommunication networks and devices. These techniques aimed at finding an optimal trade off between network performance and energy requirements. Control policies using energy-aware routing and traffic engineering can be used in order to extend these techniques to the whole network. However, the deployment of the energy-aware capabilities of heterogeneous networking is still unsystematic and impractical, as a standardized representation is still missing. To overcome such an issue, we introduce a novel framework, the Green Abstraction Layer (GAL), whose goal is to define a multi-layered abstraction interface for the hardware and physical resources. Within the GAL, energy management actions are directly performed. The GAL can be thus exposed to the platform-independent logical representation commonly used in network control protocols. Given the internal architectural complexity and heterogeneity of many network devices, the GAL approach is based on a hierarchical decomposition, where each level provides an abstract and aggregated representation of internal components. The general GAL architecture is currently under consideration for standardization in ETSI. © 2013 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Smart Grids provide an effective and efficient management of production, transmission, distribution and usage of electricity. One of the main issues in designing applications for Smart Grids is the need to cope with a plethora of different devices, communication protocols and data representations. This paper presents the design of a Home Energy Gateway (HEG) that abstracts heterogeneous devices and communication protocols and can be used to develop intelligent applications following a technology-agnostic approach. It is especially conceived to take over efficient energy management at home. Main design issues of our framework are the ability to automatically discover available devices and appliances, to track their operational status, to support different communication protocols and paradigms and to run concurrently multiple services. As an example of service, we address the implementation of a Network Connectivity Proxy (NCP), which save energy by letting unused ICT devices to remain into low-power states without losing their presence on the network. Further, some preliminary results based on the aforementioned service are also presented. © 2013 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Reducing the network energy waste is one of the key challenges of the Future Internet. Many Internet-based applications require preserving network connectivity for getting incoming remote service requests or confirming their availability and presence to remote peers by sending periodic keep-alive or heart-beating messages. Billions of dollars of electricity is wasted every year to keep idle or unused network hosts fully powered-up only to maintain the network connectivity. This paper describes a new approach to design and implement the cooperative Network Connectivity Proxy (NCP ) for reducing energy waste in the ever-growing future Internet. The NCP is implemented using Universal Plug and Play (UPnP ), that uses a set of protocols to allow seamless discovery and interaction between the network hosts and the NCP. The NCP allows all registered network hosts to transition into the low power sleep modes and maintains the network connectivity on their behalf. It handles basic network presence and management protocols like ICMP, DHCP, ARP etc on behalf of the sleeping network hosts and wakes them up only when their resources are required. Depending on the network hosts time usage model, the NCP can provide about 60 to 70% network energy savings. © The Author(s).",

To this purpose, we provide an optimization framework and a speed scaling policy for energy-aware packet forwarding engines. As shown by the results, our speed scaling policy allows saving about 18% of the power consumed by an entire network device without compromising performance during peak hours. © 2013 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "A network connected host generates/responds to routine applications and protocols heart-beat messages and is considered as disconnected when it fails to do this. Past studies have revealed that about 60-70% people leave their computers powered up 24/7 in the offices and at homes just to maintain the network connectivity. Huge amount of energy savings are possible if these computers can sleep during idle periods but still maintaining their network presence. Thus, a Network Connectivity Proxy (NCP) can be designed which is a software entity running on a low power network hardware such as switch or router and maintains the network connectivity for high power devices during their sleep periods. This paper describes the design, implementation and evaluation of a cooperative NCP that maintains the basic network and application level presence for the sleeping hosts. It also addresses the generic architecture of our NCP and its client softwares. © 2013 IEEE.",

Unfortunately, modern embedded operating systems still lack of an effective support and hardware abstraction for optimally exploiting the above mentioned aspects. Starting from these considerations, this paper proposes a novel framework, 'OpenFlow in the Small' (OFiS), specifically designed to provide a flexible hardware abstraction for a wide set of heterogeneous multi-core processors with advanced network off-loading capabilities.

      "abstract": "Improving energy efficiency of mobile devices is one of the main challenges to extend the battery life. The Wireless Network Interface Card (WNIC) or 3G is usually considered as primary source of energy consumption. To reduce the energy consumption, different proxying schemes have been proposed in literature mostly focusing on increasing WNIC idle periods through traffic shaping, reducing number of bits transmitted/received through compression techniques and putting WNIC or even the mobile device itself into sleep mode whenever possible. This paper presents the possible smart proxying schemes for mobile devices and particularly focuses on the Network Connectivity Proxy (NCP) which impersonates the mobile devices during their sleep periods and maintains their network presence. Till now the proxying schemes have only been considered for static networks without taking into account the mobility of mobile devices. This paper proposes possible proxy architectural designs in order to support host's mobility. Further, challenges and issues with each architectural design and possible solutions to tackle with those challenges have also been addressed. © 2013 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Numerous studies have shown that datacenter networks typically see loads of between 5% - 25% but the energy draw of these networks is equal to operating them at maximum load. In this paper, we propose a novel way to make these networks more energy proportional - that is, the energy draw scales with the network load. We propose the idea of traffic aggregation, in which low traffic from N links is combined together to create H < N streams of high traffic. These streams are fed to H switch interfaces which run at maximum rate while the remaining interfaces are switched to the lowest possible one. We show that this merging can be accomplished with minimal latency and energy costs (less than 0.1W) while simultaneously allowing us a deterministic way of switching link rates between maximum and minimum. Using simulations based on previously developed traffic models, we show that 49% energy savings are obtained for 5% of the load while we get an energy savings of 22% for a 50% load. Hence, forasmuch as the packet losses are statistically insignificant, the results show that energy-proportional datacenter networks are indeed possible.",

      "abstract": "In user-centric networking users become the endpoint of their communication sessions. This approach intrinsically accounts for mobility management, as terminal handovers and session migrations are expected when the user moves. However, effectiveness of session migration procedure is not trivial to assess, because it mainly concerns the subjective impressions that human users have about their interaction with the system, thus a common approach is to carry out user-evaluation at live demos. In this paper we describe the user evaluation of our dynamic user-centric networking framework, done at a national science exhibition through a Voice-over-IP application running on top of it. © 2012 ICST Institute for Computer Science, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.",

The overall idea is to introduce novel green network-specific paradigms and concepts enabling to reduce the energy requirements of wired network equipment by 50% in the short to mid-term (and by 80% in the long run). To this end, the main challenge will be to design, develop and test novel technologies, integrated control criteria and mechanisms for network equipment.

The pursued approach exploits two basic features already and largely present in today's networks and devices: the network resource virtualization and the modular architecture of nodes.

In this way, the emptied physical elements may be put in standby mode, while their logical services may continue to work elsewhere.

      "abstract": "The Internet connected edge devices require active participation by generating and responding to routine applications/protocols heart-beat messages. Failing to do this will result in loss of their presence over the Internet. A huge amount of energy is wasted every year to keep idle or unused network hosts powered-up 24/7 only to maintain the network presence for remote access, file sharing and other administrative management reasons. Thus, reducing the energy waste of ICT is becoming increasingly important due to rising costs of electricity, limited natural resources and environmental concerns. This extended abstract presents a new design of cooperative Network Connectivity Proxy (NCP) to reduce the network energy consumption. The NCP uses a low power entity that can maintain the network presence for the high power devices and smartly allows them to transition into low power sleep/active modes. The Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) protocol, that allows seamless discovery and communication between the network hosts can be well-suited approach for the design of NCP. All the hosts in the local network can seamlessly interact and use the services offered by the NCP. The UPnP based NCP includes a connectivity management service that implements the key network presence and management protocols like DHCP, ICMP, ARP etc. Thus, the NCP can reduce the network energy consumption by 60 to 70% depending on the network host's time usage model. © 2012 IFIP.",

We propose an extension of an analytical model to accurately represent the impact of green networking technologies - namely, low power idle (LPI) and adaptive rate (AR) - on network- and energy-related performance indexes. We focus on a packet-processing engine within a switching node, where LPI and AR are applied in the presence of multiple services that require different processing times of the packet headers. Given a discrete set of processing times with their probabilities, we extend our previous modeling framework based on an M<sup>x</sup>/D/1/SET queueing system to take into account the presence of multiple service times. We use the model to perform various numerical computations to evaluate energy consumption and packet delay. The results highlight how the proposed model can effectively be used to produce analytical estimates of performance indexes that can be the basis for the optimization of energy consumption-performance tradeoffs. © 2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Energy efficiency is well-known to have recently become one of the most important aspects for both today's and tomorrow's telecommunications infrastructures. To curb their energy requirements, next-generation hardware platforms of network devices are expected to include advanced power management capabilities, which may allow a dynamic trade-off between power consumption and network performance. At the same time, network protocols are going to evolve in order to carry energy-aware information, and to add them to classical performance indexes in network optimisation strategies. However, the question of how to map energy-aware indexes, often arising from low-level local hardware details, and the ones related to network performance is still an open issue. Starting from these considerations, we propose the Green Abstraction Layer (GAL), a device internal interface that provides a standard way of accessing and organising energy-aware information from the low-level hardware components to control processes. The GAL is specifically designed to hide the heterogeneous hardware implementation details, and to provide a simple, hierarchical, and common view of underlying power management capabilities to network control processes. © 2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Many network-based applications require full time connectivity of the hosts for fate sharing and responding to routine applications/protocols heart-beat messages. Past studies revealed that network hosts are most of the time unused or idle but still kept powered on just to maintain network connectivity. Thus, significant energy savings are possible if the network hosts can sleep when idle. Unfortunately, present low-power sleep modes cannot maintain network connectivity and results in applications state loss, thus preventing users from enabling power management features. A proxy-based solution was recently proposed in the literature that allows network hosts to sleep and still maintain their network standings over Internet while requiring minor changes to applications/protocols. The Network Connectivity Proxy (NCP) can handle some basic network presence and management protocols like ICMP, DHCP, ARP etc on behalf of sleeping hosts and wake them up only when it is truly necessary. This paper addresses NCP generic architecture and its requirements, main NCP responsibilities, different NCP types and their characteristics and some possible solutions to preserve open TCP connections for the sleeping hosts. It also describes key challenges in the design and implementation of NCP and proposes possible solutions. NCP can result in significant network energy savings up to 70% depending on the hosts time usage model. © 2012 Society for Modeling & Sim.",

      "abstract": "Numerous studies have shown that datacenter networks typically see loads of between 5% - 25% but the energy draw of these networks is equal to operating them at maximum load. In this paper, we propose a novel way to make these networks more energy proportional - that is, the energy draw scales with the network load. We propose the idea of traffic aggregation, in which low traffic from N links is combined together to create H < N streams of high traffic. These streams are fed to H switch interfaces which run at maximum rate while the remaining interfaces are switched to the lowest possible one. We show that this merging can be accomplished with minimal latency and energy costs (less than 0.1W) while simultaneously allowing us a deterministic way of switching link rates between maximum and minimum. Using simulations based on previously developed traffic models, we show that 49% energy savings are obtained for 5% of the load while we get an energy savings of 22% for a 50% load. Hence, forasmuch as the packet losses are statistically insignificant, the results show that energy-proportional datacenter networks are indeed possible. © 2012 Society for Modeling & Sim.",

We focus on state-of-the-art packet processing engines, which generally represent the most energy-starving components of network devices, and which are often composed of a number of parallel pipelines to divide and conquer the incoming traffic load. Our goal is to control both the power configuration of pipelines, and the way to distribute traffic flows among them, in order to optimize the trade-off between energy consumption and network performance indexes. With this aim, we propose and analyze a constrained optimization policy, which tries to find the best trade-off between power consumption and packet latency times.

      "abstract": "The energy consumption of the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector has been increasing recently; this sector is estimated to account for 2% of the total energy consumption. An even more aggressively increasing trend is the volume of Internet traffic and the number of connected devices. Thus, reducing the energy needs of the Internet is recognised as one of the main challenges that the ICT sector will have to face in the near future to reduce its overall energy footprint. Introducing energy-efficient techniques, both at the device level and the network level, is required. The main goal of this work is to quantitatively evaluate the potential energy savings from applying energy-efficient techniques, while examining the trade-off between network performance and the achieved energy savings. We introduce a categorisation of the energy-aware design space, focusing on the existing techniques in the device data plane, and contribute an analytical framework to represent the impact of energy-aware technologies and solutions for network devices. Our energy profile model represents the diverse energy-aware states of the network devices and is applied over two reference scenarios, one of a large-scale Telco (Telecom Italia) and one of a medium size Internet Service Provider (GRNET), to evaluate the impact of each energy-aware technology and the energy savings potential at the Home, Access, Metro/Transport and Core parts of each network. The results show the estimates of energy savings exceed 60% in many cases, while maintaining the same quality of service as in the energy-agnostic case. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

      "abstract": "The problem of reducing energy usage in datacenter networks is an important one. However, we would like to achieve this goal without compromising throughput and loss characteristics of these networks. Studies have shown that data-center networks typically see loads of between 5% - 25% but the energy draw of these networks is equal to operating them at maximum load. To this end we examine the problem of reducing the energy consumption of datacenter networks by merging traffic. The key idea is that low traffic from N links is merged together to create K ≤ N streams of high traffic. These streams are fed to K switch interfaces which run at maximum rate while the remaining interfaces are switched to the lowest possible rate. We show that this merging can be accomplished with minimal latency and energy costs (less than 0.1W total) while simultaneously allowing us a deterministic way of switching link rates between maximum and minimum. We examine the idea of traffic merging using three different datacenter networks flattened butterfly, mesh and hypercube networks. In addition to analysis, we simulate these networks and utilizing previously developed traffic models we show that 49% energy savings are obtained for 5% per-link load while we get 20% savings for a 50% load for the flattened butterfly and somewhat lower savings are obtained for the other two networks. The packet losses are statistically insignificant and the maximum latency increase is less than 3μs. The results show that energy-proportional datacenter networks are indeed possible. © 2012 ACM.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays people claim and expect pervasive communications, with continuous and seamless media access; that requires new communication paradigms beyond the legacy network- and device-centric approaches, and leads to the user-centric concept. Mobility is a key issue in pervasive communications, and session migration is the most related aspect with the usercentric vision; however, despite of the fact that the user should be at the center of the system, no evidence of user involvement in the design and evaluation phase can be found in the literature for this topic. In this paper we describe the user evaluation we carried out by a live demo open to a large heterogeneity of potential users at a national science exhibition. Our purpose was twofold: on the one hand, to evaluate users' feeling with our user-centric networking mobility framework based on the concept of Personal Address and, on the other hand, to figure out general indications for the whole research community about user's expectations and requirements for session migration. © 2012 Academy Publisher.",

      "abstract": "The energy management of computer hardware mainly relies on primitives defined in the ACPI industrial standard. Network devices can borrow the same concepts as a basis for their energy-efficient design; however, to effectively tailor network processors for their specific applications, the set of energy-aware states defined by the ACPI and their parameters should be carefully chosen. In particular when designing network hardware, one should address the problem of optimizing parameter values (most often chosen in a discrete set) to trade-off energy efficiency and network performance. In this paper, we provide a methodology for such choice, by investigating this trade-off over a continuous spectrum of parameter values. This approach will allow us to gain insight in the behavior of the optimal solutions that achieve different desired tradeoffs. © 2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The increased number of devices and links in today's backbones networks of Telecom, in order to maintain quality of service during busy or rush hour loads, has become in a critical factor for the power consumption in communication networks. Unfortunately, current network devices do not have power management primitives, and the energy consumption is largely independent of the load through the devices. Considering these points, we propose a viable approach to introduce and to support standby primitives in backbone network elements, which can be effectively used to almost halve the energy requirements of the whole Telecom core network. Periodic reconfiguration of nodes and links to meet incoming traffic volumes and operational constraints of real-world networks, such as reliability, stability, quality of service, and re-convergence times, is the main idea of the approach that we propose, exploring the main features of backbone device architectures, as well as the network protocol stack. © 2011 IIMC.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we consider energy-aware network devices (e.g. routers, switches, etc.) able to trade their energy consumption for packet forwarding performance by means of both low power idle and adaptive rate schemes. We focus on state-of-the-art packet processing engines, which generally represent the most energy-starving components of network devices, and which are often composed of a number of parallel pipelines to \"divide and conquer\" the incoming traffic load. Our goal is to control both the power configuration of pipelines, and the way to distribute traffic flows among them, in order to optimize the trade-off between energy consumption and network performance indexes. With this aim, we propose and analyze a constrained optimization policy, which try to find the best trade-off between power consumption and packet latency times. In order to deeply understand the impact of such policy, a number of tests have been performed by using experimental data from SW router architectures and real-world traffic traces. © 2011 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "More than a billion of new mobile phones are sold yearly, while nearly the same amount of older devices are being disposed, contributing to the e-waste challenge. Furthermore, old chargers, often not compatible with the new phones, are sent to dump too, adding up to the e-waste problem and increasing the costs for the end user. This paper reports an analysis performed on a wide number of mobile charger currently available in the market. In particular, such analysis gives the distribution of: output voltages and currents, type of connectors, efficiency, sizes, weights, etc. trying at same time to highlight the correlations (if present) among such variables and identifying the best available solution. Then, further studies based on LCA will also be presented, with the goal to analyze the mobile charger efficiencies and their related environmental impacts concerning the use phase as well as the manufacturing one. As a conclusion, the paper will provide some suggestions on the main features that a Universal Mobile Charger should have. © 2011 IEEE.",

Such high energy consumption can be mainly ascribed to networking equipment designed to work at maximum capacity with high and almost constant dissipation, independent of the traffic load. However, recent developments of green network technologies suggest the chance to build future devices capable of adapting their performance and energy absorption to meet actual workload and operational requirements. In such a scenario, this contribution aims at evaluating the potential impact on next-generation wireline networks of green technologies in economic and environmental terms. We based our impact analysis on the real network energy-efficiency targets of an ongoing European project, and applied them to the expected deployment of Telecom Italia infrastructure by 2015-2020. © 2011 IEEE.",

The achieved results demonstrate how the proposed model can effectively represent energy- and network-aware performance indexes. Moreover, also an optimization procedure based on the model has been proposed and experimentally evaluated.

      "abstract": "The concept of energy-efficient networking has begun to spread in the past few years, gaining increasing popularity. Besides the widespread sensitivity to ecological issues, such interest also stems from economic needs, since both energy costs and electrical requirements of telcos' and Internet Service Providers' infrastructures around the world show a continuously growing trend. In this respect, a common opinion among networking researchers is that the sole introduction of low consumption silicon technologies may not be enough to effectively curb energy requirements. Thus, for disruptively boosting the network energy efficiency, these hardware enhancements must be integrated with ad-hoc mechanisms that explicitly manage energy saving, by exploiting network-specific features. This paper aims at providing a twofold contribution to green networking. At first, we explore current perspectives in power consumption for next generation networks. Secondly, we provide a detailed survey on emerging technologies, projects, and work-in-progress standards, which can be adopted in networks and related infrastructures in order to reduce their carbon footprint. The considered approaches range from energy saving techniques for networked hosts, to technologies and mechanisms for designing next-generation and energy-aware networks and networking equipment. © 2011 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Today, backbone networks of telecom operators deploy a large number of devices and links. This is mainly due to both redundancy purposes for network service reliability and resource overdimensioning for maintaining quality of service during rush hours. Unfortunately, current network devices do not have power management primitives, and have constant energy consumption independent of their actual workloads. Starting from these considerations, we propose a viable approach to introduce and support standby modes in backbone network devices. This approach can be effectively used to almost halve the energy requirements of the whole telecom core network. Our main idea consists of periodically reconfiguring nodes and links to meet incoming traffic volumes and operational constraints of real-world networks, such as reliability, stability, quality of service, and reconvergence times. To this purpose, the approach we propose directly exploits the main features of both backbone device architectures and the network protocol stack. © 2006 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Internet population is growing quickly: 1.8 billion people were connected to the Internet at the end of 2009 [1] and this number is expected to grow to 2.2 billions within 2013. Right now, these people are, and will be even more surrounded by heterogeneous devices with advanced networking and rendering capabilities; in their daily life, they will demand a wide set of services and the opportunity to access more and more content in a fast, flexible and reliable way. Notwithstanding, the Internet infrastructure is showing more and more its architectural limitations for what concerns both advanced service provisioning and content fruition. The networking community is beginning to argue that one of the main issues of the current Internet is its own communication paradigm: despite users want to communicate with each other or retrieve content as fast as possible, the communication is still in terms of pair of devices that have to be located and connected to each other. There are two ways of coping with this sort of \"ossification\" of the Internet. The first one is a clean-slate re-thinking of the network layer aimed at the design of a new L3 protocol able to overcome most of the IP limitations. The second one is an incremental addition of functionalities, mainly at the application layer, on top of the current network infrastructure. In this paper we will focus on what we believe is the common element among these two approaches, namely Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs), able to offer distribution and replication of information, high levels of scalability, resilience and selfadaptation, fast access to time-critical information, and much more.",

      "abstract": "Due to the continuous growth of customer population, the spreading of broadband access, the increase in energy price, and the expanding number of services being offered by telecoms and providers, energy efficiency issue has become a high-priority objective for wired networks and services infrastructures. Current network devices are well-known to be over-dimensioned for rush-hour traffic loads, and to have Oat energy requirements with respect to their real utilization. Recent studies suggested to reduce the energy consumption of networks and networked devices through the introduction of adaptive capabilities, which allow to modulate energy requirements according to network-aware performance (i.e., delays, packet losses, etc.). However, at the today's state of the art, the real impact of these power management techniques is not clear, and requires further studies and researches. Based on this context, we focus on development of a new simulator called \"GreenSim\", that aims at analyzing and evaluating the impact of adaptive energy saving techniques both on network- and energy-sides in the presence of real traffic traces and data. The results achieved with the proposed simulator demonstrate that these green technologies, when applied to packet processing engines inside network devices, can save up more that 40% of energy consumption in the presence of real Internet traffic profiles, while maintaining an acceptable network performance level.",

      "abstract": "Mobility is a common issue in modern communications. Traditionally, terminal devices have been playing a leading role and thus the main interest has been targeted to terminal mobility. However, nowadays people claim and expect pervasive communications, with continuous and seamless media access, regardless of the device they are using. That requires new communication paradigms and mobility solutions, in order to overcome the legacy network- and device-centric approaches. In this paper we discuss our mobility framework for multimedia communications which accounts for both terminal handover and session migration implementing the user-centric paradigm in networking. It basically works at the network layer and requires only minimal application-specific operations, yielding to a high level of generality, applicability and flexibility. To prove this, we apply the mobility framework to the interactive multimedia communication, implementing a Video and Voice over IP application. The mobility framework has been deployed in a real test-bed and submitted to user judgment in a live demo at an Italian national science exhibition. We report the qualitative feedback got from users which clearly demonstrates both the feasibility of the proposed solution and the growing attractiveness of communicating in a user-centric fashion.",

      "abstract": "The rapid diffusion of wireless technologies for network access has fostered the expectation for enhanced forms of communication in the current and future Internet. To this aim, there is a large consent about pursuing user-centric and pervasive paradigms; that requires an integrated and uniform approach to mobility management, taking into account all the different aspects of this issue. However, current mobility protocols exhibit important limitations and drawbacks. Starting from these considerations, this paper sketches a mobility framework based on overlay infrastructures; we describe the main features it should exhibit and then we focus on the problem of keeping track of mobile node's location inside the network.

      "abstract": "Advances in wireless communications have driven an interest towards ubiquitous computing environments for nomadic users. This has led to a more user-centric vision of the network and to the concept of personal network: the user exploits his personal devices (both local and remote) and those in the surrounding environment to build dynamic ad hoc communication systems for the best experience in enjoying multimedia. In this paper, we propose a mobility framework for personal networks based on the idea of a 'personal mobile address' to bind a network address to the user rather than to a network interface, allowing the address to follow the user as he moves. We show how this mobility framework could be used for real-time interactive communications, in particular for voice-over-IP sessions managed by SIP. Moreover, we sketch a software architecture for this framework and evaluate its feasibility by means of a prototype. Copyright © 2010 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",

      "abstract": "Real-time multimedia traffic requires some minimum delivery guarantees to be effectively transmitted over packet-switched networks. This is even more necessary when interactive sessions (e.g., Voice-over-IP applications) are involved. Effective and timely packet delivery is sometimes achieved by overdimensioning network capacity. However, this is not the most practical and economic solution. Instead, providing a specific service to different traffic types may achieve better results without wasting network resources. Quality of Service (QoS) be implemented at different layers of the protocol stack, but tight control at the link layer is essential when the physical medium is shared among a number of devices. Wireless LANs are a typical example of that. The IEEE 802.11e amendment enhances the original version of the WiFi standard with new QoS functionalities. It maintains backward compatibility with legacy hardware, and this may cause the priority scheme to be ineffective in those deployments where non-QoS enabled hardware is present. In this paper, we analyze some widespread commercial 802.11 products to check the effectiveness of the QoS mechanisms. We show that all hardware under examination fails in providing effective QoS guarantees when legacy stations are present. © 2009 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The availability of a large number of personal, wireless multimedia devices enables the users to benefit multimedia content while moving. A further enhancement is given by the availability of context information (in terms of users' location, environment, etc.) that enables the adaptation of the multimedia content to the context and to the availability of alternative renderers. In this paper, we propose a context-aware mobility framework that supports context-dependent, multimedia interactive applications. This framework manages mobility of multimedia sessions by introducing the concept of Personal Address, that is a network identifier assigned to users and their sessions. The mobility framework also leverages on the concept of context server to interact with heterogeneous context sources on a wide area network. We describe the implementation of this framework for Voice-over-IP sessions and we report the performance results. Copyright © 2009 ACM.",

Mobility will be one of the key issues in such evolution. Current mobility protocols have a number of limitations and drawbacks; until now, there is not any general solution that could face all aspects of mobility. The only notable examples are targeted to specific applications. We believe that mobility could be effectively managed through overlay networks at the application layer.

The trend towards ubiquitous computing raises expectations from the users about enjoying multimedia contents everywhere and with any device. However, current protocols for streaming data (e.g., RTSP) have not been designed for this purpose, thus they fail in providing the user with a transparent and seamless media experience in nomadic life. In this paper we propose a framework for multimedia delivery and adaptation in mobile environments.

      "abstract": "Interesting research in the areas of traffic classification, network monitoring, and application-oriented analysis can not proceed without real traffic traces, labeled with actual application information. However, hand-labeled traces are an extremely valuable but scarce resource in the traffic monitoring and analysis community, as a result of both privacy concerns and technical difficulties. Hardly any possibility exists for payloaded data to be released, while the impossibility of obtaining certain ground-truth application information from non-payloaded data has severely constrained the value of anonymized public traces. The usual way to obtain the ground truth is fragile, inefficient and not directly comparable from one,s work to another. This paper proposes a methodology and details the design of a technical framework that significantly boosts the efficiency in compiling the application traffic ground truth. Further, a case study on a 30 minute real data trace is presented. In contrast with past work, this is an easy hands-on tool suite dedicated to save user,s time and labor and is freely available to the public. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2009.",

However this evolution will impact dramatically on the existing infrastructures since the fruition of 3D content in real time by a huge number of people poses new issues related to the system responsiveness and to the ability of managing context information. In this paper we observe that actions related to the acquisition of context from the physical and from the virtual worlds, as well as actuation in both worlds can be considered as a special case of context management and actuation. For this reason we propose an architecture for the management of such aspects within a unique framework, and an experimental testbed that validates the architecture.",

      "abstract": "The high coverage of the territory by cellular networks and the widespread diffusion of mobile terminals aboard vehicles allow one to collect information on the traffic behavior. The problem of selecting a dynamic model to describe the freeway traffic by using the information available from a wireless cellular network is addressed by assuming the distribution of mobile terminals aboard vehicles to be uniform along the carriageway. Two different nonlinear parametrized models of freeway traffic are investigated: the first is an extension to a well-established macroscopic model, while the second is based on a black-box approach and consists in using a neural network to approximate the traffic dynamics. The parameters of such models are identified off line by a least-squares technique. Traffic measurements obtained from a cellular network are employed to identify and validate the proposed models, as shown by means of simulations. © 2009 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Motivated by the importance of accurate identification for a range of applications, this paper compares and contrasts the effective and efficient classification of network-based applications using behavioral observations of network-traffic and those using deep-packet inspection. Importantly, throughout our work we are able to make comparison with data possessing an accurate, independently determined ground-truth that describes the actual applications causing the network-traffic observed. In a unique study in both the spatial-domain: comparing across different network-locations and in the temporal-domain: comparing across a number of years of data, we illustrate the decay in classification accuracy across a range of application-classification mechanisms. Further, we document the accuracy of spatial classification without training data possessing spatial diversity. Finally, we illustrate the classification of UDP traffic. We use the same classification approach for both stateful flows (TCP) and stateless flows based upon UDP. Importantly, we demonstrate high levels of accuracy: greater than 92% for the worst circumstance regardless of the application. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge of emergent properties of existing peer-to-peer file-sharing communities can be helpful for the design and implementation of innovative peer-to-peer protocols/services that exploit autonomicity, self-configuration, resilience, scalability, and performance. It is well known that the performance of this class of peer-to-peer applications depends on several parameters that represent the topological structure of the overlay network, the users' behavior, and resource dynamics. Estimation of these parameters is difficult, but it is crucial for analytical models as well as for realistic simulation of peer-to-peer applications. In this paper, we present an active measurement-based study designed to glean insights on the above parameters within the Gnutella network. The measurement software that we developed is able to collect topological information about the overlay network topology in a few minutes; in a second step, it contacts the users discovered during the topological measurement in order to acquire a novel dataset regarding the shared resources. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

However this rapid evolution gives rise to several issues related to the management of a large number of multimedia streams in the home communication infrastructure. An issue of particular relevance is how a context acquisition system can be used to support the management of such a large number of streams with respect to the Quality of Service (QoS), to their adaptation to the available bandwidth or to the capacity of the involved devices, and to their migration and adaptation driven by the users' needs that are implicitly or explicitly notified to the system. Under this scenario this paper describes the experience of the INTERMEDIA project in the exploitation of context information to support QoS, migration, and adaptation of multimedia streams. © 2008 IEEE.",

In this paper we look at analytical and simulation models, which can be used for quantifying volumes of P2P teletraffic at the network layer, to ease still existing difficulties associated with monitoring such teletraffic. We present an event-driven simulator, able to simulate P2P teletraffic both at the application and network layers in large overlay networks (we have successfully tested it in networks used by up to 500,000 peers). The simulation model was developed for studying the impact that P2P systems have on the network layer performance. We studied also the application layer dynamics by looking at time evolution of file-downloading processes and at the offered load generated in such networks. We report the results of several simulation scenarios, in which we focused on the consequences such teletrafflc has on the Internet access link of an enterprise network.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays the majority of Internet traffic is generated by peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing applications. As the popularity of these applications has been increasing dramatically over the past few years, it becomes increasingly important to analyze their behavior and to understand their effects on the network. The ability to quantify their impact on the network is fundamental to a number of network operations, including traffic engineering, capacity planning, quality of service, forecasting for long-term provisioning, etc. We present here a measurement study on the characteristics of the traffic associated with two different P2P applications. Our aim is to provide useful insight into the nature of P2P traffic from the point of view of the network. To achieve this, we introduce a novel meauserement, Content Transfer Index (CTI), to distinguish two classes of behavior associated with P2P traffic: the download and the signaling traffic profile. Next we apply the CTI to our data sets and show that it effectively offers a general characterization of P2P traffic. Finally, we present a number of statistical measurements that are significantly unbiased due to having considered the distinction between the two classes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to follow this approach. We believe such a study will help researchers better understand the impact of P2P applications on the network and how to improve their performance. © 2008 IEEE.",

Our aim is to offer useful insight into the nature of P2P traffic, which we consider a step toward building P2P traffic aggregates generators in simulative environments. We show that P2P traffic can be divided into two distinguished behavioral profiles, which, independently of the application protocol, present significant differences in the average and standard deviation of four measurements: arrival times, durations, volumes and average packet sizes of P2P conversations. These profiles well represent the typical behavior of signaling and download traffic. Based on our findings, we argue that, if such distinction is not taken into account, the statistical measurements needed to model P2P traffic aggregates would result biased, and potentially bring to misleading results. © 2008 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "A multiservice IP Virtual Private Network is considered, where Quality of Service is maintained by a DiffServ paradigm, in a domain that is supervised by a Bandwidth Broker (BB). The traffic in the network belongs to three basic categories: Expedited Forwarding (EF), Assured Forwarding (AF) and Best Effort (BE). Consistently with the DiffServ environment, the Service Provider's Core Routers (CRs) only treat aggregate flows; on the other hand, the user's Edge Routers (ERs) keep per-flow information and convey it to the BB. The latter knows at each time instant the number (and the bandwidth requirements) of flows in progress within the domain for both EF and AF traffic categories. A global strategy for admission control, bandwidth allocation and routing within the domain is introduced and discussed in the paper. The aim is to minimize blocking of the \"guaranteed\" flows (EF and AF), while at the same time providing some resources also to BE traffic. In order to apply such control actions on-line, a computational structure is sought, which allows a relatively fast implementation of the overall strategy. In particular, a mix of analytical and simulation tools is applied jointly, by alternating \"local\" decisions, based on analytical models, with flow-level simulation that determine the effect of the decisions on the whole system and provide feedback information. The convergence of the scheme (under a fixed traffic pattern) is investigated and the results of its application under different traffic loads are studied by simulation on three test networks. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

      "abstract": "From the birth of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) protocols, Internet traffic has changed its characteristics; the amount of traffic carried by the web has grown exponentially with strong effects on traffic matrixes, both for the distributed nature of P2P protocols and for their intense bandwitdh request. Many research works studied the features and the behaviors of such P2P protocols, simulating the overlay network topologies at the application layer. We present a scalable P2P model, which is particularly focused on file popularity, considered as the level of interest that a file arouses in the system. The work has the aim of describing the effects that such a quantity generates in the query behavior, assuming that it is strongly linked to marketing procedures. For this reason we make use of the product life cycle in marketing environment to model such level of interest. The model can represent huge overlay networks, up to 500000 peers. The properties of such a model are studied considering the resulting file query distribution, by running multiple independent replications for every simulation. The number of queries performed by every peer and the peer' uptime are also considered, in order to validate the model, comparing simulation output with the measurement results in Gnutella network. © ECMS 2007.",

In this contest, our aim is to customize, to analyze and to optimize a Linux based architecture for an exclusive networking use. In particular, the objective of this work is to study, to evaluate the performance and to optimize the IP lookup mechanism included in the Linux kernel.

      "abstract": "The goal of this paper is that of reporting the results obtained in the identification of a macroscopic dynamic model that can describe the freeway traffic using the information available from a wireless cellular network. To this end, we need to assume that the distribution of mobile terminals aboard cars be uniform along the freeway and to deal with the cells of the cellular network as the sections in which a freeway stretch is divided. The information on the mobile terminals concerns their positions and speed. Two different approaches are investigated. The former is an extension to quite a standard freeway macroscopic model, while the latter is a black-box approach that consists in using a neural network to represent the traffic dynamics. The parameters of the former and the neural weights of the latter are identified off line by a least-squares approach. Numerical results obtained after identification and validation are reported using the data generated by a microscopic simulator. © 2007 IEEE.",

P2P traffic stresses network infrastructures with highly dynamic and distributed traffic matrices, whose vertices heavily depend on the overlay network and on the query mechanism adopted. Two of the most important characteristics of real P2P systems are the huge number of peers and their very dynamic behavior. In this respect, our aim is to propose a simulation approach capable to represent the peers' and files' dynamics in very scalable way. This approach is able to give indications about the file distribution behavior and queries' success percentage along time and to support network managers or traffic modeling tools in determining the impact of P2P applications on transport networks.

      "abstract": "Scarceness of bandwidth is a common problem to all radio networks. The cellular structure with frequency reuse has been the solution for many years in the past; however, decreasing cell sizes results in increasing handoff requests and this could be critical in high mobility environments. Moreover, the cellular structure cannot ensure the best utilization of resources when the distribution of the users inside the system is not constant in time. In this paper we focus on handoff protection and efficient dynamic bandwidth allocation for multi-service networks in high-mobility environments, in presence of very simple strategies for the Call Admission Control, in order to assure scalability. We propose to find an optimal solution by using a new simple heuristic which exploits the prediction of the system behaviour made by some suitable network model; moreover, a more traditional approach based on a stochastic algorithm is derived from the Montecarlo methods for comparison. Simulation results show that the proposed heuristic approach performs better, especially in critical situations. © 2006 IEEE.",

The link bandwidth allocation in the network is based on a hybrid combination of analytical and simulation models. The allocation tool works in three phases: phase 1 and 2 deal with the assessment of the capacities needed to satisfy requirements for QoS and BE traffic individually; the effects of multiplexing gains arising from traffic mixing are taken into account in phase 3. There are two analytical parts, based on a simplified version of call-level traffic models, derived from teletraffic theory of circuit-switched networks, and on an algorithmic procedure to compute the distribution of average values of BE traffic flows, respectively. The same algorithm is used inside a fast simulation model, adopting a fluid representation of TCP traffic aggregates.

      "abstract": "A multiservice IP network based on the DiffServ paradigm is considered, composed by Edge Routers (ER) and Core Routers (CR), forming a DiffServ domain that is supervised by a Bandwidth Broker (BB). CRs only treat aggregate flows while ERs keep per-flow information (from external sources or other network Domains), and convey it to the BB, which knows at each time instant the number (and the bandwidth requirements) of flows in progress within the domain for both Expedited Forwarding (EF) and Assured Forwarding (AF) traffic categories. A global strategy for admission control, bandwidth allocation and routing within the domain is introduced and discussed in the paper. The aim is to minimize blocking of the \"guaranteed\" flows (EF and AF), while at the same time providing some resources also to Best Effort (BE) traffic. As the main objective is to apply the above mentioned control actions on-line, a computational structure is sought, which allows a relatively fast implementation of the overall strategy. In particular, a mix of analytical and simulation tools is applied jointly: \"locally optimal\" bandwidth partitions for the traffic classes are determined over each link (which set the parameters of the link schedulers in the CRs, the routing metrics and admission control thresholds); a \"high level\" simulation, based on the fluid approximation (involving no packet-level operation description), is performed, to determine the per-link traffic flows that would be induced by the given allocation; then, a new analytical computation is carried out, followed by a simulation run, until the allocations do not significantly change.",

      "abstract": "Dynamic-routing in a packet-switched telecommunication network with Quality of Service (QoS) capabilities is addressed. The problem is posed in an informationally decentralized (team) setting, where routing and scheduling decisions are combined. Such decisions are taken at the network nodes, on the basis of local information and possibly of some data received from the neighboring nodes, with the common goal to minimize the expected total delay, spent by packets in traversing the network. Stationarity of the control strategies over an infinite optimization horizon (in the presence of no changes in the traffic parameters and network topology) is achieved by considering an approximation based on a receding-horizon approach. Optimal strategies in this setting are in turn approximated by means of feed-forward neural networks. The problem is posed and a computationally decentralized algorithm for its numerical solution is described. A specific numerical example is also considered, where the neural approximators are tuned, and then used in constructing dynamically varying routing tables and scheduling coefficients in a network simulation based on ns-2, where the gain of the dynamic strategies is evaluated, over an adaptive routing approach based on the measurement of aggregate traffic parameters. © 2005 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Wireless communications have always faced the scarceness of bandwidth and until today the cellular division has solved this problem by making radio cells always smaller. However, as cell size is reduced, more users will probably require handoffs, and signaling can overload the system. Further, the decrease in cell dimension cannot ensure the best utilization of system resources, because user density in the cell is not constant over the time. Dynamic allocation might be the solution, but it is a complex task, basically due to complexity of the models for the mobility prediction, especially in those environments where users move very fast (e.g. highways). This last one is a typical environment where high mobility of vehicles does not allow small cell sizes and thus system capacity is intrinsically bounded. In this paper, we deploy an analytical model for a cellular network operating in a high mobility environment. Such a model is capable of representing and forecasting wireless system evolution in terms of channel occupancy, starting from the current state of the mobile network and road traffic. This model has been defined by integrating a vehicular traffic model with a wireless cellular communication one. With such approach the dynamic behaviour of the most critical mobile terminals, those associated with vehicles, are described in a very precise and specific way with respect to mobility. Many results obtained with specific simulation tools and herein reported show the good behaviour of our proposal. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

      "abstract": "The dynamic-routing problem in a packet-switching telecommunication network is addressed by a receding-horizon approach. The nodes of the network must accomplish the following tasks: i) generating routing decisions to minimize the expected total delay, spent by messages in the network, on the basis of local information and possibly of some data received from the neighboring nodes; ii) computing their routing strategies by measuring local variables and exchanging a small amount of data with other nodes. The first task leads to regard the nodes as the cooperating decision makers of a team organization. The second task calls for a computationally distributed algorithm. To solve this team optimal control problem two main approximating choices have been done: 1) the use of a receding-horizon framework, and 2) the use of a given structure for each decision maker, in which a finite number of parameters have to be determined to optimize the packet routing. Among the various possible fixed-structure functions, feed-forward neural networks have been chosen for their powerful approximation capabilities. The neural approximation of such team-optimal routing strategies is computed in a numerical example, and used in network routing simulations performed by means of NS-2, in order to show the feasibility and effectiveness of the methodology.",

      "abstract": "Pricing for the use of telecommunication services is an issue widely treated in the literature. In the last years it has received a growing attention in order to establish various fairness criteria in the bandwidth allocation for each type of traffic class. A number of pricing models have been proposed and analyzed in the context of Quality of Service (QoS) guaranteed networks (e.g. ATM, IP Integrated Services, IP Differentiated Services) and more recently, also for Best Effort (BE) environments. In the context of QoS networks the pricing scheme can influence the Call Admission Control (CAC) rules. On the contrary, for a BE service, users accept a variable bandwidth allocation, they are not subject to CAC and their pricing policies, according to the Proportional Fairness Pricing, are integrated within the flow control. In this paper we investigate the condition where both BE traffic and traffic explicitly requiring QoS (Guaranteed Performance, GP) are present. We propose three CAC rules for the GP traffic. The aim is to maximize the Internet Service Provider's overall revenue and to establish a bound over the GP traffic prices. Numerical results are presented to show the good performance of the proposed techniques. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

      "abstract": "A multiservice IP network based on the DiffServ paradigm is considered, composed by Edge Routers (ER) and Core Routers (CR), forming a domain that is supervised by a Bandwidth Broker (BB). The traffic in the network belongs to three basic categories: Expedited Forwarding (EF), Assured Forwarding (AF) and Best-Effort (BE). Consistently with the DiffServ environment, CRs only treat aggregate flows; on the other hand, ERs keep perflow information (from external sources or other network Domains), and convey it to the BB, which knows at each time instant the number (and the bandwidth requirements) of flows in progress within the domain for both EF and AF traffic categories. A global strategy for admission control, bandwidth allocation and routing within the domain is introduced and discussed in the paper. The approach adopted is based on the combination of analytical and simulation models of traffic with service guarantees and of TCP aggregated traffic. The global scheme (under different traffic patterns) is investigated and the results of its application under different traffic loads are studied on a test network with a ns-2 simulation tool.",

      "abstract": "Pricing for the use of telecommunication services has received in the last years a growing attention. The main objective is to establish various fairness criteria in the bandwidth allocation among different traffic classes. In the context of Quality of Service (QoS) networks (e. g. ATM, DiffServ, IntServ) the pricing scheme influences the Call Admission Control (CAC) rules. While, for Best Effort (BE) services, users accept a variable bandwidth allocation and are not subject to CAC and the pricing policies, according to the Proportional Fairnes Pricing, are integrated within the flow control. In this paper we consider both BE traffic and traffic explicitly requiring QoS (Guaranteed Performance, GP) and we propose three Call Admission Control rules for the GP traffic. The aim is to maximize the Internet Service Provider s overall revenue and to establish a bound over the GP traffic prices. Numerical results are presented to show the good performance of the proposed techniques.",

      "abstract": "Starting from the mid-1990s, a growing attention has been devoted to more and more sophisticate pricing models for telecommunication services. A number of pricing models have been proposed and analyzed in the context of quality or service (QoS) guaranteed networks and, more recently, also for best effort (BE) environments. Concerning QoS networks, the optimization often influences the call admission control (CAC). In a BE network, where users do not declare QoS parameters and there is no CAC, the pricing policies should be integrated within the flow control and they are different from those adopted in the QoS environments. In this paper we investigate the condition where both BE traffic and traffic explicitly requiring QoS (guaranteed performance, GP) are present. We propose three mechanisms that influence both GP CAC and BE flow control and that are aimed at maximizing the overall revenue for all traffic classes. Moreover, we want to investigate the influence of the BE Pricing scheme on the GP traffic in order to establish a bound for the Internet Service Provider on the prices imposed to the GP users. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

      "abstract": "This paper analyzes the performance of some dynamic routing algorithms for ATM and IP-over-ATM networks. The main algorithm, named AR-DLCP (Alternate Routing - Distributed Least Congested Path), is based on a distributed computation, where the \"best\" route is chosen node-by-node in the call set-up phase, by taking decisions on the basis of a cost function, composed of a local part and an aggregate part. The local cost is constructed for each outgoing link on the basis of the knowledge of the current and the maximum number of connections that the link can support, while still ensuring the required Quality-of-Service at the cell level. The aggregate cost is aimed at reflecting the congestion situation of a node and is computed through an information exchange mechanism among adjacent nodes. In a fully connected core network, only direct and two-hop paths are considered; in the general meshed topology case, paths are organized in a two-level hierarchy. Static and dynamic trunk reservation schemes that guarantee enough bandwidth to direct paths are discussed. The performance of the two alternatives is evaluated by simulation under various traffic load situations. In particular, AR-DLCP is compared with other algorithms already in the literature as DLCP, Learning Automata and RTNR (Real Time Network Routing). In the general topology case, the algorithm is also combined with a bandwidth allocation mechanism and IP routing, by taking into account the presence of best-effort traffic, in an IP-over-ATM context. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.",

      "abstract": "Among several models that are available to represent the aggregate cell flow generated by on-off sources at an ATM multiplexer (either at an access or a switching node), the Interrupted Bernoulli Process (IBP) is characterized by particular simplicity and analytical tractability. The superposition of sources individually modeled as an IBP, whose cells enter a common buffer, is considered in this paper. The main goal is to compute approximations of two basic Quality of Service (QoS) indicators, namely, cell loss rate, whose analytical computation has been already presented in previous works, and the rate of cells exceeding a specified delay, whose presentation constitutes the theoretical novelty of the paper. Analytical expressions of these two quantities are given for homogeneous sources, i.e., possessing the same statistical parameters and QoS requirements. The analytical formulation is carefully evaluated by comparing the results obtained with others presented in the literature and with simulation results; in the latter, the actual cell arrival process is generated by means of a Markov Modulated Deterministic Process (MMDP) model of the on-off sources. Several comparisons are performed for different offered loads and by varying the buffer length, which show the effectiveness and the limits of the technique under investigation. © 2001 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",

      "abstract": "In the context of an IP-over-ATM access and transport network, carrying guaranteed quality (CBR, rt-VBR) services as well as IP datagrams (as ABR or UBR traffic classes), we consider the joint problems of Call Admission Control (CAC), bandwidth allocation and routing. The presence of distributed access multiplexers is assumed, which are both geographically dispersed (e.g., at the user premises) and hierarchically structured. Such multiplexers are intelligent devices with decision making capabilities that operate jointly, in order to make the best possible use of the transport capacity of the access network and to maintain the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of different users and service classes. Following the physical system organization, a hierarchical control structure is defined, where the admission of calls for real-time traffic classes (or different users) is performed by independent controllers; the latter are parametrized by the bandwidths allocated by a common link agent, playing the role of a \"link coordinator\" in the hierarchical control scheme. This decision maker aims at minimizing a general cost that captures QoS requirements both at the call-level (call blocking probability) for QoS-aware, connection-oriented services and at the cell-level (cell loss probability) for connectionless, best-effort, ones. The control architecture also reflects the multilayer hierarchy introduced by the presence of multiple teletraffic time scales, by essentially decoupling the above problem from that of ensuring QoS at the cell-level for services of the first type. We derive the optimal parameters' setting from the numerical solution of a mathematical programming problem. Then, the same structure is applied to link multiplexers of the transport network nodes, which are supposed to possess both ATM and IP switching/routing capabilities. Routing strategies at both ATM and IP levels are defined, which are combined with the above described CAC and bandwidth allocation scheme. The performance of the whole structure is tested by simulation. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2001.",

      "abstract": "The paper proposes two alternative bandwidth allocation schemes suited for the Ka-band satellite environment. The aim is to provide a control mechanism to compensate rain fade. The main idea is considering the effect of the attenuation as a reduction of the bandwidth 'seen' by a single land station and using a supplementary portion of bandwidth to guarantee a rain margin. One of the earth stations involved plays the role of master. It monitors the available resources and contains the Centralized Network Control Center, which manages the bandwidth allocation. Both schemes are organized in two hierarchical levels. The upper level, located in the master station, assigns a portion of the overall bandwidth to the earth stations. At each of these, the lower level shares the received portion between guaranteed anal non-guaranteed traffic. The allocation mechanisms are aimed at keeping the call blocking probability of the guaranteed traffic below a given threshold and at reducing the packet dropping probability of the nonguaranteed, best-effort traffic. An extensive performance analysis has allowed investigating the behavior of the two strategies and to evidence the differences between them.",

      "abstract": "A cellular wireless network is considered, where multi-class call admission control is exerted locally in a number of cells. Cells are in turn organized into clusters, which play the role of a higher hierarchical control level. The whole capacity (in number of channels) available in a cluster is distributed among its cells, according to variations in traffic parameters and user mobility, with the goal of minimizing the average blocking probability for the whole system. At the same time, on the basis of a temporarily assigned capacity, cell controllers regulate the admission of new calls and the handoff flow, by setting thresholds on the maximum number of new calls that prevent the blocking probability of the handoff calls to exceed a given upper bound. The overall resource allocation mechanism is described and numerical results are presented and discussed, in relation with different user mobility patterns.",

      "abstract": "The paper proposes a bandwidth allocation scheme adapted for satellite networks. The traffic considered is divided into two categories: guaranteed traffic and non-guaranteed best-effort traffic. The control scheme is aimed at keeping the call blocking probability of the guaranteed traffic below a given threshold and at minimizing the packet discarding probability of the best-effort portion in case of degradation of the satellite channel. In that way a minimum grade of service should be guaranteed for both traffics. The allocation scheme is designed as a two-level hierarchical mechanism: the upper level allocates a portion of the overall bandwidth to each station, the lower level shares the received portion between guaranteed and non-guaranteed traffic. The results show the behaviour of the algorithm and its performance.",

For every picture or for each group of contiguous pictures (GOP), the encoder generates an information set organized in a hierarchical layered structure. The base layer contains the information needed to a low quality video; the other layers contain data, which, if received and decoded, can enhance the video quality. The basic idea is to reserve bandwidth only to grant the transmission of base layer information, and modify the MAC scheme to manage the video enhancement data together with voice/data streams, by adaptively transmitting the incremental video information only if the performances of other traffic classes will not drop below a certain threshold. The aim of this proposal is the improvement of the video stream quality in low load conditions, without a significant reduction of other traffic classes performance during high load periods.

      "abstract": "An advanced system of driving assistance is considered, which is based on a network of radar (and, in some situations, infrared) sensors alongside the motorway. The system is capable of tracking each single vehicle in the coverage area individually and to transmit the picture of vehicle positions and velocities to a control center in real time. The latter processes the received data, in order to detect possible dangerous situations or anomalies in the traffic flow and to correlate them to specific vehicles (slower or stopping vehicles ahead, queues, and the like), and it retransmits the appropriate pieces of information to receiving devices on-board the vehicles, through a dedicated digital radio channel. In this way, drivers can be advised by the system on the road situation in front of them, and become aware of danger conditions in real time, even in the case of scarce or almost null visibility. The paper presents the characteristics of the tracking and prediction mechanisms used for updating the traffic picture at the control center, as well as to reduce the flow of information that is fed back to the on-board devices. © 1999 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "A solution for the routing problem in ATM Virtual Circuits at call set-up level is considered, by combining Call Admission Control (CAC) and routing decisions in a hop-by-hop fashion at the nodes along a route. Service separation is assumed, and the overall traffic flows are divided into classes, homogeneous with respect to performance requirements and statistical characteristics. The bandwidth of each link in the network is shared among the classes according to some specified policy that also determines the CAC rule. At each node traversed, a call request of a certain class is first assigned a subset of outgoing links towards the destination, upon which the resources necessary to maintain the required level of Quality of Service are available; then, a routing decision is taken, by choosing the least `cost' link, according to a specific criterion. The link costs are dynamically updated for all traffic classes, by means of local information and aggregate information exchanged among neighbouring nodes. Costs are based on a measure of the link saturation, in terms of some `distance' from the boundary of the load region in call-space that the multiplexer serving the link can support. Five different strategies are described and compared, which essentially differ in terms of the way the link bandwidth is allocated among the traffic classes (and, accordingly, the CAC operation is performed).",

      "abstract": "We consider the problem of multimedia service distribution over an integrated services broadband access network, based on the transport of fixed-size traffic units (ATM cells). In general, the presence of distributed access multiplexers is assumed, which are both geographically dispersed and hierarchically structured. Such multiplexers are intelligent devices with decision making capabilities that operate jointly, in order to make the best possible use of the transport capacity of the access network and to maintain the quality of service (QoS) requirements of different users and service classes. Following the physical system organization, a hierarchical control structure is defined, where each service class is served by an independent controller, parametrized by the bandwidth allocated to it, and a central agent, playing the role of a coordinator in the hierarchical control scheme, decides upon the bandwidth partitions. This decision aims at minimizing a global cost that captures QoS requirements both at the call-level (call blocking probability) for QoS-aware, connection-oriented services and at the cell-level (cell loss probability) for connectionless, best-effort, ones. The control architecture also reflects the multilayer hierarchy introduced by the presence of multiple teletraffic time scales, by essentially decoupling the above problem from that of ensuring QoS at the cell-level for services of the first type. The cost functions used in the optimization and the control strategies are described, and numerical results are reported, which indicate the effectiveness of the method.",

      "abstract": "A congestion control mechanism is presented, aimed at increasing performances for multimedia traffic in \"best effort\" networks. A source-destination point-to-point video communication is investigated. The control algorithm dynamically varies the encoder configuration on the base of some feedback information from the destination. The selection of the proper configuration is performed by a control block called \"smart coder\" which, after receiving the feedback information, can change the transmission rate to optimize the level of Quality of Service (QoS) perceived by the user for a certain network status. The change of the transmission rate is performed by acting on coding parameters as the type of video coder, the spatial resolution, the frame rate and so on, formally defined in the paper. Feedback information is based on the measure of the average rate of the lost packets, but since this measure cannot give information about underload condition, a specifically designed probing mechanism, based on the introduction of a redundancy in the video flow, is used. A relevant part of the paper is dedicated to the analysis of the results: the efficiency of the control scheme is tested in a local environment based on the Ethernet protocol.",

      "abstract": "An access multiplexer is considered, serving a TDM output channel with a hybrid structure, characterized by the presence of both isochronous (circuit-switched) and asynchronous (packet-switched) traffic. The isochronous traffic is, in turn, subdivided into several classes, which are distinguished according to their speed, in order to model a multirate, multitraffic environment. The aim of the paper is to define a control scheme for the allocation of the output link bandwidth, in order to realize two objectives: 1) minimize call blocking probability for the isochronous traffic and packet loss probability, and 2) meet quality of service requirements for both traffic types as closely as possible. The proposed scheme is based on a hierarchical control structure, where the description of the dynamics of the isochronous traffic is given in terms of continuous-time Markov chains and the packet rejection rate is approximated by means of the stationary distribution of an M/Pareto/1/K queue by exploiting the large difference in time scales between the isochronous flows and the asynchronous one. There are two control levels: 1) a \"fast\" one acting on the admission of isochronous calls by means of distributed decisional agents (one for each traffic class) which operate with the time scale of the connection request process dynamics, and 2) a slower one, playing the role of a coordinator in the hierarchical scheme, which periodically recomputes a set of parameters (related to the bandwidth allocation) by numerically solving a parametric optimization problem, where real-time information as well as traffic statistics are taken into account.

The global control system is organized into two blocks: the “coding agent” and the “congestion controller”. This latter detects a congestion situation and decides the bit rate to use for the transmission. The choice is based on some feed-back information from the receiver and is aimed at preventing the future congestion. The “coding agent” chooses the transmission characteristics corresponding to the highest MOS among the ones offering the selected bit/rate.

      "abstract": "A node-by-node admission control and routing scheme for ATM networks is devised. The scheme is based on the subdivision of traffic into a number of classes, characterized by different performance requirements. At each network node, for all outgoing links, link capacity partitions are periodically assigned to the traffic classes, as the result of an optimization problem over a fixed time interval. Local access control rules compute the maximum number of connections of each class that a link can accept within the assigned capacity. Incoming call connection requests are forwarded in a hop-by-hop fashion. Each node traversed, first checks the presence of resources needed to accept a new connection and guarantee all quality of service (QoS) requirements. This is done by using the local access control rule. Then, it chooses the next node along the path on the basis of a distributed routing strategy. This minimizes a cost function accounting for local instantaneous information, as well as for aggregate information that is passed periodically among adjacent nodes. Two routing strategies are introduced. In the first scheme, a new call is rejected if, at a certain node along the path, there are not enough resources to guarantee QoS requirements, and no recovery mechanism is implemented. In the second scheme, an alternative path is looked for after the first failure. Simulation results are presented which show a comparison between the two proposed routing strategies. Comparison is also made between the proposed scheme and the other approaches. © 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

      "abstract": "A multiple access protocol, based on a Reservation Random Access (RRA) scheme, is derived for a wireless cellular network carrying real-time and data traffic. Given a TDMA framed channel and a cellular structure, the aim of the protocol is that of maximizing the one-step throughput over an entire frame. This is achieved by deciding on the access rights at the cell base station, which then broadcasts this information at the beginning of the frame. The decision is made on the basis of binary channel feedback information (collision/no collision) over the previous frames, as well as of long term averages of packet generation rates at the mobile stations, assuming independence in the presence of packets at the latter. The resulting protocol has therefore been termed Independent Stations Algorithm (ISA), and the overall scheme RRA-ISA. As in other RRA protocols, time constrained (e.g., voice) traffic operates in a dynamic reservation mode, by contending for a slot in the frame with the first packet of a burst, and then keeping the eventually accessed slot for the duration of the burst; packets of the time constrained traffic unable to access a slot within a maximum delay are dropped from the input buffer. No such constraint is imposed on data traffic. Together with the \"basic\" version of the access algorithm, three other variants are presented, which exploit three simple different priority schemes in the RRA-ISA \"basic\" structure, in order to give a prominence to the voice service. The aim of these variants is to improve the performance in terms of the maximum number of stations acceptable in the system, by slightly increasing the data packets delay. All the proposed schemes are analyzed by simulation in the presence of voice and data traffic. Several comparisons show a relevant performance improvement (in terms of data delay and maximum number of voice stations acceptable within a cell) over other protocols that use ALOHA as a reservation mechanism (RRA-ALOHA or PRMA schemes).",

The predictive content of sequences of Meteosat half-hourly images is exploited in this work, aiming at the development of storm identification and cloud tracking procedures suitable for operational use in flash flood forecasting applications. Though relying essentially on image processing techniques, the cloud tracking approach seems quite useful in the short term prediction of the dynamics of MCCs as the resolution scale of the temporal sampling provided by the satellite sensor is short enough to ensure that abrupt changes in the cloud characteristics are not likely to occur between two subsequent images. Some studies are presented to show the potential of the procedure and the evidence of strong interactions between the synoptic atmospheric dynamics and local enhancing factors (e.g. thermal effects and orography) in triggering convection. It is concluded that, in the case of small size catchment hydrology, cloud tracking techniques play a role in supporting the assessment of the risk of flooding, provided that no quantitative rainfall estimates are addressed, but cloud cover and cloud dynamics parameters are used within a probabilistic approach to flood hazard assessment at the regional scale.",

The traffic is considered to be divided into classes, characterized by statistical parameters like peak and average bandwidth, and by Quality of Service (QoS) requirements that allow us to define a 'feasibility region' where such requirements are guaranteed. A model to describe the 'call admission' is proposed. Then, three alternative strategies to get the maximum number of acceptable connections, by taking into account the probability of blocking a call at the call set-up level, are described. The first one is intended to minimize the overall call blocking probability; the second one is aimed at balancing the probability among the different traffic classes; while the last one allows us to enforce a constraint on the call blocking probability. The efficiency of the proposed strategies is tested by simulation and verified by comparing it with other admission control schemes that appear in the literature.",

      "abstract": "In this paper a CAC scheme is considered and different alternatives to compute the maximum number of acceptable calls for each traffic class involved are evaluated. The traffic is considered divided in traffic classes, characterised by statistical parameters like peak and average bandwidth and burstiness, and by specific performance requirements. A ‘feasibility region’ where performance requirements are surely satisfied is defined and a model to describe the call acceptance method is presented. Then, three alternative strategies to get the maximum number of acceptable connections, by taking into account the probability of blocking a call at the call set-up, are described. The first one is intended to minimise an overall measure of the call blocking probability, the second is aimed to balance the probability between the different traffic classes while the last one allows to have a constraint on the call blocking probability. All the strategies are tested by simulation and compared with other mechanisms already in the literature.",

The traffic is divided into classes, characterized by statistical parameters and by Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, as the rates of lost and delayed cells. At connection set-up, a strategy decides if a connection request has to be accepted or rejected and which is the best route that all the cells of that connection have to follow. The decision about acceptance guarantees the QoS requirements for each class, while the routing strategy is aimed at minimizing the number of blocked calls in the network. The whole system provides also a mechanism to achieve a fair and adaptive bandwidth allocation for each traffic class; the bandwidth allocation control has a longer intervention period than the admission and routing control. In fact, the global strategy can be regarded as a hierarchical one. Several simulation results are reported, to verify the effectiveness both of the admission and routing mechanism and of the allocation strategy.",

Given a TDMA framed channel and a cellular structure, the aim of the protocol is that of maximizing the one-step throughput over an entire frame. This is achieved by deciding on the access rights at the base station, which then broadcasts this information at the begInning of the frame. The resulting protocol has been termed Independent Stations Algorithm (ISA), and the overall scheme RRA-ISA. As in other RRA protocols, time constrained (e.g., voice) traffic operates in a dynamic reservation mode, by contending for a slot in the frame with the first packet of a burst, and then keeping the eventually accessed slot for the duration of the burst; packets of the time constrained traffic unable to access a slot within a maximum delay are dropped from the input buffer. No such constraint is imposed on data traffic. The three different variants which are presented, aim at improving the maximum number of stations acceptable in the system, taking into account the quality constraint. This improvement is achieved by applying three different priority schemes which give a prominence to the service of the voice traffic. The different schemes are analyzed by simulation in the presence of voice and data traffic. Several comparisons show a relevant performance improvement (in terms of data delay and maximum number of voice stations acceptable within a cell) of ISA schemes over other protocols that use ALOHA as a reservation mechanism (RRA-ALOHA or PRMA schemes), as well as the gains achievable over basic RRA-ISA by applying the modified strategies.",

The last step concerns the motion prediction of processed clouds.

      "abstract": "We consider a DQDB network carrying both isochronous and asynchronous traffic flows. Different classes of isochronous traffic are distinguished, according to their speed and originating user site, and their dynamics is modelled by continuous time Markov chains; the asynchronous packet traffic is represented by a single class. The allocation of slots in each frame to the various traffic classes is dynamically decided by means of two control levels: a distributed one, acting on the admission of isochronous connection requests independently for each class; and a centralized one, periodically adjusting two sets of parameters that affect the admission control functions. One such set represents upper bounds on the number of slots that may be assigned to each isochronous traffic class, i.e. its maximum capacity; the remaining bandwidth is shared by the asynchronous packets by means of the distributed queue algorithm. The capacity assignment is performed by minimizing a cost function that takes into account call blocking probabilities and packet delay. The control problem, which is characterized by multiple time scales, is discretized with respect to events occurring in an equivalent overall embedded Markov chain. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the method in ensuring quality of service requirements. © 1995.",

      "abstract": "A combined multiple access protocol is investigated, based on the ISA algorithm, which was first introduced for a slotted unframed channel, and later modified to fit a cellular wireless network with distributed handoff [13, 14]. ISA manages the access rights at the beginning of each slot in order to maximize the success probability (one step throughput), based on an independence assumption on the presence of packets at the stations. We extend this concept in the context of a framed channel that has the same basic structure as Packet Reservation Multiple Access (PRMA) [1]. In this case, it is possible to see the frame as a whole bunch of 'parallel channels', over which the overall success probability must be maximized at the beginning of the frame for all free slots. The combined PRMA-ISA algorithm has been developed and investigated by means of simulations, using models previously proposed for data and voice (phone calls) traffic.",

      "abstract": "A hierarchical control structure is proposed to ensure performance requirements and to maintain load balancing among different traffic classes at an ATM node. A two‐level control hierarchy is defined, where one level performs fixed class‐selective call admission control strategies that are periodically dynamically coordinated by a higher level bandwidth allocation controller. The call admission control rules are designed to maintain a certain grade of service, in terms of cell loss probability, given the buffer space and bandwidth (percentage of cells) assigned to each class. The assignment of buffers is performed off‐line, whereas bandwidth shares are periodically recomputed on‐line by the allocation controller, that attempts to minimize a cost function, accounting for overall cell loss and refused traffic. The bandwidth assignments obtained are passed to the call admission controllers, where they are used as parameters affecting the admission rules until the next intervention. The control structure, the strategies and the optimization algorithm used are described in detail, as well as the assumptions underlying the choices that have been made.

      "abstract": "A proposed model of an ATM access node is extended to describe a network featuring a node by node admission control and routing strategy. A hierarchical dynamic resource allocation scheme is periodically applied at each node to every outgoing link, in order to reassign link capacity partitions among various service classes. Local access control rules compute the maximum number of connections of each class that a link can accept, by using the assigned capacity. A call request packet is generated with every connection request, and it is sent along a path from the source to the destination node. Each node traversed checks the presence of the resources needed to accept a new connection, by using the local access control rule. A connection is accepted only if every node on the path has enough resources to support it (also maintaining the quality of service for connections in progress), and it is refused otherwise. The path of the request packet is chosen by using a distributed routing strategy. At every node traversed, an output link is chosen by minimizing a cost function composed by two terms: a 'local' and a 'global' one. The local term takes into account the situation of the node by using a simple calculation, whereas the global term holds the aggregate information about the situation of the network, and it is updated and passed along periodically by every node. A complete description of the global scheme and simulation results are reported and discussed.",

At the lower level, call admission control rules are applied that maintain a certain grade of service, in terms of cell loss probability and cell delay, given the buffer space and bandwidth assigned to each class; unlike those used in previous works, these rules are derived on the basis of homogeneous (based on similar quantities) measures of the performance requirements. At the higher level, bandwidth shares are periodically recomputed on-line by an allocation controller, whose goals reflect overall cell loss and refused traffic, as well as overall average delay. These goals are expressed by an optimization problem that is solved by numerical techniques. The whole control system should provide a dynamic feedback controller, capable of reacting in real time to changes in the traffic patterns. Simulation results are presented and discussed, regarding the efficiency of the admission controllers, the performance of the overall scheme, and the capability of reacting to sudden changes in the load of some traffic class.",

Conflicts occur whenever two or more packets are sent through the same output port. An algorithm to solve such situations is stated. It yields a suboptimal solution for the combinatorial local decision problem. A coordination among the local decision problems is performed by making each node pass aggregate information regarding the congestion of the downstream portion of the network to its predecessors.",

      "abstract": "An admission control and bandwidth allocation strategy is applied to several traffic classes entering an ATM (asynchronous transfer mode) network through a statistical multiplexer. At the call level, incoming virtual calls are either accepted or refused on the basis of a class-selective control rule designed to maintain a certain grade of service. Each class is assigned a buffer partition and a virtual capacity share, which affect the parameters of the acceptance controller. Buffer space is assigned statically with an offline procedure; on the other hand, bandwidth shares are periodically recomputed online at the cell level, by means of the (parametric) constrained minimization of a cost function, which takes cell loss probability and refused traffic into account. These quantities are computed by observing the number of refused, accepted, and active (i.e., possibly generating bursts) calls within the previous decision interval, and are assumed to be slowly varying with respect to the cell dynamics. In turn, the results of the optimization are used to adaptively adjust the parameters of the access controller.",

Local access controllers at the users' sites independently decide on the acceptance of each new isochronous call by applying a randomized decision rule. A central controller periodically reassigns bandwidth partitions (in slots/frame) between isochronous and asynchronous traffic, as well as upper bounds on the isochronous slots assigned on a per-user basis. This assignment is obtained by means of a parametric optimization that acts on a number of parameters characterizing the local decision rules, in order to minimize a suitable cost function, and depends on the overall system's state at the intervention time. The problem is formalized, and the application of a gradient projection method is considered, with cost functions spanning a finite or even infinite future time horizon.",

Each user is assigned a portion of the total available bandwidth, in terms of slots/frame, which is dynamically allocated between the two traffic types at the user premises, by means of a local randomized decision rule. The users's bandwidth shares (capacities) are allocated by a centralized agent, whose goal is to minimize a global cost function that accounts for packet delays and call blocking of the entire process over an infinite time horizon (i.e., in the stochastic steady state). In order to track possible slow variations of the traffic generation parameters, periodic interventions of the central agent are effected. This gives rise to a parametric optimization problem with time-varying constraints, whose specific characterization is discussed.",
