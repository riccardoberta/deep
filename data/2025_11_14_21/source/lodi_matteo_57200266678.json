The inverters interfacing the RES with the grid are equipped with dedicated controllers that set a power reference proportional to the rate of change of the electrical frequency (RoCoF) of the grid. In the grid following configuration, the RoCoF must be evaluated in real-time, but measurement noise and delays make the real provided inertia deviate from the imposed one. This work aims to quantify the effects of measurement noise and delays on the synthetic inertia provided by a grid-following inverter equipped with a virtual hidden inertia emulator, connected to a wind farm. Both simulations and experimental tests exploiting a hardware prototype and a real-time simulator are carried out in different scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Enhancing power density is a primary objective in electronic power converters. This can be accomplished by employing smaller inductors operating in partial magnetic saturation. In this study, an embedded digital controller is proposed, based on nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC), for the regulation of a DC–DC boost converter, exploiting a partially saturating inductor. The NMPC prediction model exploits a behavioral inductor model that accounts for magnetic saturation and losses and allows the converter regulation while enforcing constraints. The NMPC controller is implemented on a field programmable gate array (FPGA), demonstrating its real-time feasibility while successfully controlling a boost converter operating at switching frequencies up to 80 kHz. Hardware–software co-simulation results show accurate voltage regulation and constraint satisfaction, even under partial magnetic saturation.",

      "abstract": "In power supplies, inductors operating in partial magnetic saturation are increasingly exploited, to increase power density and efficiency. The design and simulation of converters exploiting nonlinear magnetic components require accurate models, able to predict their voltage/current characteristics and power losses under different operating conditions. In practical applications, inductors are subjected to either square-wave or sinusoidal voltages with different amplitude, frequency, and duty cycle. We focus on amorphous-core inductors, characterized by an extremely soft magnetic behavior and reduced magnetic losses, with a weak temperature dependence. We propose a novel behavioral circuit model with some temperature-dependent parameters, composed of two coupled nonlinear inductors and linear resistors; a capacitor is also included to account for parasitic capacitances occurring at higher frequencies for the winding. The model is tested on two amorphous-core inductors. Good accuracy is obtained in reproducing the inductor current (with different dc biases) and power loss, for sinusoidal, square, and triangular voltages with different amplitudes (also leading to magnetic saturation), frequencies (from 25 to 200 kHz), and temperatures (from 23 to 100 ^{\\circ }C).",

We employ the stability analysis proposed in a recent paper, based on the formulation of a master stability function, to study cluster synchronization in adaptive networks with neural plasticity. We investigate how adaptation affects multistability in the network, where each stable solution encodes an archetypal pattern for auto-associative memories. This analysis is carried out with respect to the overall coupling strength, the adaptation rule, the number of nodes of the network, and the number of coexisting stable solutions. In particular, the coupling strength can be tuned to determine the maximum cluster size and the variability in the cluster sizes.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a black-box method for generating surrogate data from measurements taken on inductors working up to magnetic saturation. The proposed method is based on a sequential neural network architecture, optimized through the Python Tensorflow framework and the Keras API, which accurately predicts the inductor flux dynamics under varying operating conditions. The generated data can be useful to fit existing circuit models to a limited set of physical measurements (easy-to-measure quantities, i.e., inductor voltage and current), complemented by the obtained surrogate data. The proposed black-box model performs well in predicting flux across different frequencies and amplitudes. This research is a first proof of concept (we focus on zero-bias sinusoidal inputs and amorphous-core inductors at fixed temperature); anyway, it highlights the potential of combining deep learning with robust optimization and pre-processing techniques to improve predictive accuracy in circuit models of inductors working up to magnetic saturation. These models can be used for simulating and designing high-power-density switch-mode power supplies.",

      "abstract": "Synchronization of coupled oscillators is a fundamental process in both natural and artificial networks. While much work has investigated the asymptotic stability of the synchronous solution, the fundamental question of the transient behavior toward synchronization has received far less attention. In this work, we present the transverse reactivity as a metric to quantify the instantaneous rate of growth or decay of desynchronizing perturbations. We first use the transverse reactivity to design a coupling-efficient and energy-efficient synchronization strategy that involves varying the coupling strength dynamically according to the current state of the system. We find that our synchronization strategy is able to synchronize networks in both simulation and experiment over a significantly larger (often by orders of magnitude) range of coupling strengths than is possible when the coupling strength is constant. Then, we characterize the effects of network topology on the transient dynamics towards synchronization by introducing the concept of network syncreactivity: A network with a larger syncreactivity has a larger transverse reactivity at every point on the synchronization manifold, independent of the oscillator dynamics. We classify real-world examples of complex networks in terms of their syncreactivity.",

      "abstract": "Adaptive networks with time-varying connectivity, often called plasticity, provide a fundamental paradigm to model complex dynamical systems. In these systems, different groups of elements frequently exhibit different yet synchronized dynamics within each group. Here we propose a framework to study patterns of synchronous solutions in a large class of plastic networks and derive a general approach to analyze the stability of these solutions. This approach decouples the role of the network topology from that of the dynamic, thus leading to a dimensionality reduction of the stability problem and allowing us to investigate how adaptation affects the emergence of multi-stable patterns of synchronized activity. To illustrate its potentialities, we apply our method to three networks of oscillators, with distinct topology, dynamics, and adaptation rules. Our working framework encompasses a large class of heterogeneous multi-layer dynamical networks, connected (even with delays) via different plastic links, and can have a broad impact on the analysis of complex plastic networks.",

      "abstract": "The inertia of a power grid measures the system's ability to counteract frequency changes, remaining synchronized and stable when triggered by external disturbances. Renewable energy sources (RES) are interfaced with the grid through power converters without the intrinsic (mechanical) inertia of synchronous machines; therefore, a strong presence of RES reduces the global inertia of the system, compromising its stability and reliability. Thus, it is fundamental to develop power converter controllers that provide synthetic inertia by mimicking the electro-mechanical behavior of a synchronous machine. This paper investigates the performances of three different power converter control techniques that generate virtual inertia. As a case study, we consider a 4-bus power network to analyze the grid reaction to a rapid load increase.",

      "abstract": "Central pattern generators are small networks that contribute to generating animal locomotion. The models used to study gait generation and gait transition mechanisms often require biologically accurate neuron and synapse models, with high dimensionality and complex dynamics. Tuning the parameters of these models to elicit network dynamics compatible with gait features is not a trivial task, due to the impossibility of inferring a priori the effects of each parameter on the nonlinear system's emergent dynamics. In this paper we explore the use of global optimization strategies for parameter optimization in multigait central pattern generator (CPG) models with complex cell dynamics and minimal topology. We first consider an existing quadruped CPG model as a test bed for the objective function formulation, then proceed to optimize the parameters of a newly proposed multigait, interlimb hexapod CPG model. We successfully obtain hexapod gaits and prompt gait transitions by varying only control currents, while all CPG parameters, once optimized, are kept fixed. This mechanism of gait transitions is compatible with short-term synaptic plasticity.",

      "abstract": "The dynamics of the brain results from the complex interplay of several neural populations and is affected by both the individual dynamics of these areas and their connection structure. Hence, a fundamental challenge is to derive models of the brain that reproduce both structural and functional features measured experimentally. Our work combines neuroimaging data, such as dMRI, which provides information on the structure of the anatomical connectomes, and fMRI, which detects patterns of approximate synchronous activity between brain areas. We employ cluster synchronization as a tool to integrate the imaging data of a subject into a coherent model, which reconciles structural and dynamic information. By using data-driven and model-based approaches, we refine the structural connectivity matrix in agreement with experimentally observed clusters of brain areas that display coherent activity. The proposed approach leverages the assumption of homogeneous brain areas; we show the robustness of this approach when heterogeneity between the brain areas is introduced in the form of noise, parameter mismatches, and connection delays. As a proof of concept, we apply this approach to MRI data of a healthy adult at resting state.",

      "abstract": "Several software tools are available in the literature for the design and embedded implementation of linear model predictive control (MPC), both in its implicit and explicit (either exact or approximate) forms. Most of them generate C code for easy implementation on a microcontroller, and the others can convert the C code into hardware description language code for implementation on a field programmable gate array (FPGA). However, a unified tool allowing one to generate efficient embedded MPC for an FPGA, starting from the definition of the plant and its constraints, was still missing. The MOBY-DIC2 toolbox described in this brief bridges this gap. To illustrate its functionalities, the tool is exploited to embed the controller and observer for a real buck power converter in an FPGA. This implementation achieves a latency of about 30μ s with the implicit controller and 240 ns with the approximate explicit controller.",

This aim can be achieved by using smaller inductors operating at partial magnetic saturation. In this work, a partially saturating ferrite core inductor is exploited in a switching DC-DC boost converter, regulated through nonlinear model predictive control. A nonlinear behavioral inductor model, identified through experimental measurements, accounts for both magnetic saturation and losses. The simulation results show that the converter output voltage is correctly regulated and the imposed current constraints are fulfilled, even when partial magnetic saturation occurs. Comparisons with traditional control techniques are also presented.",

We start from the description of MCCs in the flux-charge domain and the state space decomposition in invariant manifolds and then we apply three different techniques, of numerical and analytic nature, for finding the synchronization condition in terms of a circuit parameter. Two of these techniques provide conditions to guarantee synchronization on any manifold and for any attractor on a manifold, while a third technique allows analyzing synchronization for each specific attractor on a fixed manifold through more precise conditions. The pros and cons of the three techniques are discussed and an application to a more realistic memristor model is provided.",

However, integrating photovoltaic and wind power plants in traditional power grids threatens the stability of the system if no additional synthetic inertia is provided by control systems. Due to the intermittent nature of RES, the inertia of the power plants and of the entire grid is time-varying, calling the need for online monitoring methods. In this paper, we implement on a microcontroller an algorithm for online estimation of the inertia constant and damping coefficient of individual energy sources. The behavior of this embedded implementation is analyzed with respect to some key parameters and tested on the IEEE 14-bus power system.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we study the network pinning control problem in the presence of two different types of coupling: (i) node-to-node coupling among the network nodes and (ii) input-to-node coupling from the source node to the \"pinned nodes.\"Previous work has mainly focused on the case that (i) and (ii) are of the same type. We decouple the stability analysis of the target synchronous solution into subproblems of the lowest dimension by using the techniques of simultaneous block diagonalization of matrices. Interestingly, we obtain two different types of blocks, driven and undriven. The overall dimension of the driven blocks is equal to the dimension of an appropriately defined controllable subspace, while all the remaining undriven blocks are scalar. Our main result is a decomposition of the stability problem into four independent sets of equations, which we call quotient controllable, quotient uncontrollable, redundant controllable, and redundant uncontrollable. Our analysis shows that the number and location of the pinned nodes affect the number and the dimension of each set of equations. We also observe that in a large variety of complex networks, the stability of the target synchronous solution is de facto only determined by a single quotient controllable block.",

Inertia estimation during normal operating conditions of the network is still an open problem, since most algorithms rely on post-fault data or injection of probing signals in the grid. Here we extend a previously proposed algorithm for online inertia estimation to account for the presence of turbine governors in the power grid. The algorithm was tested on the IEEE 14-bus power system and it was successful in tracking the inertia of generators with and without turbine governors.",

      "abstract": "Switch-mode power supplies (SMPSs) are widely exploited to interface electrical energy sources to motors and other electrical loads. Inductors are usually the biggest and heaviest components in SMPSs, limiting their overall power density. Therefore, there is an increasing interest in designing SMPSs with partially saturating inductors, because this significantly reduces their weight and size, thus increasing power density. This paper provides a review of nonlinear behavioral models (based on easy-to-measure quantities) of the inductance, power loss, and temperature rise of inductors working, at least partially, in magnetic saturation. This survey discusses the pros, cons, and ranges of validity of these models, with a glimpse at their application to SMPS simulation, design, monitoring, and control.",

      "abstract": "Cluster synchronization in networks of coupled oscillators is the subject of broad interest from the scientific community, with applications ranging from neural to social and animal networks and technological systems. Most of these networks are directed, with flows of information or energy that propagate unidirectionally from given nodes to other nodes. Nevertheless, most of the work on cluster synchronization has focused on undirected networks. Here we characterize cluster synchronization in general directed networks. Our first observation is that, in directed networks, a cluster A of nodes might be one-way dependent on another cluster B: in this case, A may remain synchronized provided that B is stable, but the opposite does not hold. The main contribution of this paper is a method to transform the cluster stability problem in an irreducible form. In this way, we decompose the original problem into subproblems of the lowest dimension, which allows us to immediately detect inter-dependencies among clusters. We apply our analysis to two examples of interest, a human network of violin players executing a musical piece for which directed interactions may be either activated or deactivated by the musicians, and a multilayer neural network with directed layer-to-layer connections.",

To this end, a new hybrid inversion procedure exploiting a qualitative delay-and-sum method together with a conjugate-gradient-like scheme developed in Lebesgue spaces has been used. The feasibility of the approach has been assessed by means of a prototype of measurement system equipped with ten bowtie-like antennas and using a simplified phantom.

      "abstract": "The increasing presence of renewable energy sources (RES) in a power grid tends to reduce its inertia constant, which quantifies the grid's ability to contrast the frequency changes due to external disturbances. This led to the development of control strategies that interface the RES to the grid providing synthetic inertia, but these strategies cannot avoid oscillations of the overall system inertia, thus requiring algorithms for the online inertia constant estimation under normal operating conditions of the power grid. In this paper, we consider one of these algorithms, which exploits the data measured online through phasor measurement units, and critically analyze it, in order to efficiently apply it to the estimation of the inertia constant in the IEEE-14-bus power system, also with the addition of a PV power plant. The obtained results point out an increased efficiency of the online estimation of the network inertia.",

      "abstract": "We study networks of coupled oscillators and analyze the role of coupling delays in determining the emergence of cluster synchronization. Given a network topology and a particular arrangement of the coupling delays over the network connections, different patterns of cluster synchronization may emerge. We focus on a simple ring network of six bidirectionally coupled identical oscillators, for which with two different values of the delays, a total of eight cluster synchronization patterns may emerge, depending on the assignment of the delays to the ring connections. We analyze stability of each of the patterns and find that for large enough coupling strength and specific values of the delays, they can all be stabilized. We construct an experimental ring of six bidirectionally coupled Colpitts oscillators, with delayed connections obtained by coupling the oscillators via RF cables of appropriate length. We find that experimental observations of cluster synchronization are in essential agreement with theoretical predictions. We also verify our theory in a fully connected network of fifty nodes for which connections are randomly assigned to be either undelayed or delayed with a given probability.",

      "abstract": "The presence of synchronized clusters in neuron networks is a hallmark of information transmission and processing. Common approaches to study cluster synchronization in networks of coupled oscillators ground on simplifying assumptions, which often neglect key biological features of neuron networks. Here we propose a general framework to study presence and stability of synchronous clusters in more realistic models of neuron networks, characterized by the presence of delays, different kinds of neurons and synapses. Application of this framework to two examples with different size and features (the directed network of the macaque cerebral cortex and the swim central pattern generator of a mollusc) provides an interpretation key to explain known functional mechanisms emerging from the combination of anatomy and neuron dynamics. The cluster synchronization analysis is carried out also by changing parameters and studying bifurcations. Despite some modeling simplifications in one of the examples, the obtained results are in good agreement with previously reported biological data.",

In this paper we introduce a new model (with design criteria) of a generalized half-center oscillator, (pools of) neurons reciprocally coupled by fast/slow inhibitory and excitatory synapses, to produce either alternating bursting or other rhythmic patterns, characterized by different phase lags, depending on the sensory or other external input. We also show how to calibrate its parameters, based on both physiological and functional criteria and on bifurcation analysis. This model accounts for short-term neuromodulation in a biophysically plausible way and is a building block to develop more realistic and functionally accurate CPG models. Examples and counterexamples are used to point out the generality and effectiveness of our design approach.",

      "abstract": "This article is concerned with the design of synthetic central pattern generators (CPGs). Biological CPGs are neural circuits that determine a variety of rhythmic activities, including locomotion, in animals. A synthetic CPG is a network of dynamical elements (here called cells) properly coupled by various synapses to emulate rhythms produced by a biological CPG. We focus on CPGs for locomotion of quadrupeds and present our design approach, based on the principles of nonlinear dynamics, bifurcation theory, and parameter optimization. This approach lets us design the synthetic CPG with a set of desired rhythms and switch between them as the parameter representing the control actions from the brain is varied. The developed four-cell CPG can produce four distinct gaits: walk, trot, gallop, and bound, similar to the mouse locomotion. The robustness and adaptability of the network design principles are verified using different cell and synapse models.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, a nonlinear observer is proposed for the estimation of the current ripple in a ferrite-core inductor working in partial saturation, mounted on a boost converter. The estimator is based on a recently proposed nonlinear inductance model, which expresses the inductance as a function of the inductor current, taking into account also the non-negligible effects of the core temperature. The proposed observer is implemented on a low-cost microcontroller and tested, both offline and online, on a real boost converter with different operating conditions. The offline tests show a satisfactory estimation accuracy both during the electrical (fast) and thermal (slow) transients. Due to the high microcontroller latency, some delays and inaccuracies occur during electrical transients in the online tests. This work suggests that, in order to exploit the observer for control purposes, the target architecture should be a high-performance microcontroller, a system-on-chip, or a field programmable gate array, where parallelism can be exploited to speed-up the computations. The proposed implementation can be instead suitable for switch-mode power supply (SMPS) monitoring purposes.",

      "abstract": "More compact Switch-Mode Power Supplies (SMPSs) satisfying typical design specifications can be obtained by exploiting ferrite core inductors working in partial saturation. In this case, the inductance is no longer a constant parameter, since it exhibits a sharp drop as the inductor current increases. A behavioral model was recently proposed, which provides the inductance at steady state as a function of easy-to-measure quantities. Here, a generalization of this model is presented, in order to capture the inductance behavior also during thermal transients. The model fitting to experimental measurements relies on an iterative optimization procedure grounding on accurate SMPS simulations based on shooting analysis. The model validation exploits the envelope analysis method, particularly suitable for slow-fast systems. The obtained fitting results show a good agreement with experimental data both in transient conditions (after sudden variation of the SMPS operating condition) and at steady state. Finally, by partially re-identifying the model based on data measured when the inductor is cooled with a fan, we still obtain a good matching between model and experimental data.",

      "abstract": "This paper is concerned with modeling of smart textiles, aimed at compensating their intrinsic nonlinearities. In particular, a new model is proposed to compensate for hysteresis and relaxation in strain sensors made of Electrolycra. These sensors are increasingly employed in emerging areas such as wearable electronics and soft robotics for their simple transduction mechanism and low cost. However, being intrinsically nonlinear, the signals measured from these devices need some processing, in order to increase their sensing accuracy. Here, we propose a new model for the compensation of the main distortions intrinsic to these soft sensors, which are mainly caused by hysteresis and relaxation, whose combined effect produces rate-dependent hysteresis. The model capabilities are tested on experimental data measured on Electrolycra. The comparisons with the results obtained with two different models witness the good behavior of the proposed model.",

The choice of a specific component depends on many factors, often requiring a trade-off between conflicting needs. In this paper a nonlinear inductance model for a whole family of ferrite-core inductors is proposed. An inductor family includes components with the same magnetic core and a different number of windings, which determines the nominal inductance. The proposed model, which includes magnetic saturation and dependence on the average inductor power loss, is exploited to evaluate the impact of the nominal inductance on the current ripple and power loss, in the SMPS design. A Pareto frontier is identified, which allows selecting optimal values of the nominal inductance, by trading off power loss and current ripple.",

Unlike conventional thermal modeling approaches, which require information on core temperature, the proposed behavioral model relies only on easily measurable quantities.

In this case, the inductance is no longer a constant parameter, since it exhibits a sharp drop as the inductor current increases.

In this paper, a generalization of this model is presented, in order to capture the inductance behavior also during the thermal transient. The model inputs are the the inductor current and the SMPS load current, both measurable quantities. The model fitting to experimental measurements relies on accurate SMPS simulations performed with the envelope analysis method, particularly suitable for fast-slow systems. The simulations are also used to validate the model reliability, through comparisons with the experimental results on a boost converter.",

In addition, we analyze an enhanced locomotion system that incorporates a neuromechanical model for each leg and includes mechanisms of sensory feedback. We demonstrate how the proposed CPGs produce the desired gaits, which remain robust with respect to external perturbations.",

In particular, the paper is focused on synthetic CPGs made up of few basic elements and governing quadrupeds' gaits and gait transitions, under the control of an external drive. The method combines the principles of bifurcation theory, geometric properties of symmetry, and numerical analysis based on the recently proposed toolbox CEPAGE. The method is applied to two CPGs, one bio-inspired and one purely synthetic. In both the cases, the method provides a way to obtain a desired sequence of gaits by continuously changing a bifurcation parameter related to the external drive.",

Two dual approaches are presented, based on the local and global characterization of the inductor under small- and large-amplitude current ripple conditions. The resulting curves provide inductor current prediction in agreement with experimental data.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel method for design and circuit implementation of approximate controllers for constrained hybrid or piecewise affine (PWA) systems, through switched model predictive control technique. The PWA solution (discontinuous, in general) provided by this method is approximated by another PWA function composed of continuous patches defined over regular simplices. Two circuit architectures for the implementation of this approximate controller are proposed, which allow achieving reduced complexity and shorter latency, with respect to the circuits implementing the exact controller. This makes it possible the control of systems with smaller sampling times. The performances of the approximate controller are shown through hardware-in-the-loop testings of the closed-loop system. © 2013 TU Dresden.",
