      "abstract": "Many of the recovery and renovation interventions of the existing heritage conducted today in Europe are the result of urban policies careful to reduce land consumption and improve safety, comfort, and quality according to the needs of users. A substantial historical building heritage characterizes the Italian territory. Historical centres' regeneration is one of the constant and recurring themes of extreme complexity and importance due to the extension, the peculiarities, and the conformation in some cities. The contribution presented deals with the redevelopment and reactivation of a historic district of Genoa, which has one of the largest historical centres in Europe. Innovation, together with the three pillars of sustainability (environmental, social, and economic), are the engines of this pilot project to trigger virtuous processes for the district's reactivation. It is an area of the historic centre with high potential in its proximity to essential activities of the city, the port, and infrastructure. The proposed plan for the regeneration of the area resulted from an in-depth analysis of the territory's state and existing practices and was carried out in close collaboration with the reference bodies and actors involved. This preliminary analysis made it possible to identify the strengths and weaknesses that were the starting point for the pilot project. The article then focuses on two specific aspects. Some of the university's buildings are in the district, and this is the starting strength for creating a \"diffuse\"university campus with areas to serve students. On the other hand, the open spaces are the point of weakness on which we have worked with outdoor lighting to increase the degree of security of the neighbourhood and enhance the peculiarities and value of existing spaces.",

      "abstract": "Model-based control techniques have been gaining more and more interest these days. These complex control systems are mostly based on theories, such as feedback linearization, model predictive control, adaptive and robust control. In this paper the latter approach is investigated, in particular, sliding mode (SM) control is analyzed. While several works on the description and application of SM control on single-input single-output systems can easily be found, its application on multi-input multi-output systems is not examined in depth at the same level. Hence, this work aims at formalizing some theoretical complements about the necessary conditions for the feasibility of the SM control for multi-input-multi-output systems. Furthermore, in order to obtain the desired performance from the control system, a method for parameter tuning is proposed in the particular case in which the relative degree of the controlled channels is equal to one. Finally, a simple control problem example is shown with the aim of stressing the benefits derived from the application of the theoretical complements described here.",

      "abstract": "The article is focused on the \"demonstration\" activities carried out by the University of Genoa at Savona Campus facilities in order to implement the \"Living Lab Smart City\". The idea is to transform the Savona Campus in a Living Lab of the City of the Future: smart technologies in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and energy sectors were installed in order to show a real application of the Smart City concept to population and external stakeholders. Moreover, special attention was given to the environment, personal wellbeing, and social equalities. The sustainable energy Research Infrastructures (RIs) of Savona Campus allowed enhancement of the applied research in degree programs and the collaboration with several companies. In particular, an important partnership with the Italian electric Distribution System Operator (DSO), ENEL S.p.A., started in 2017 to test the capability of these RIs to operate disconnected from the National Grid, relying only on the supply of renewables and storage systems. The \"Living Lab Smart City\" is an important action to reduce the carbon footprint of the Savona Campus and to increase the awareness of students, teachers and researchers towards Sustainable Development in Higher Education Institutes.",

The present paper describes a probabilistic risk-based DSA, which provides instability risk indicators by combining an innovative probabilistic hazard/vulnerability analysis with the assessment of contingency impacts via time domain simulation. The tool implementing the method can be applied to both current and forecast PS states, the latter characterized in terms of renewable and load forecast uncertainties, providing valuable results for operation and operational planning contexts. Some results from a real PS model are discussed.",

The entire system is already installed on the distribution MV network of Sanremo, in the North of Italy, within the Smartgen research project. The acquisition architecture consists of a SCADA system, which allows the data exchange from meters installed in the MV-LV substations. In order to satisfy the system observability conditions and to perform the State Estimation (SE) algorithm, real-time measures need to be integrate with the pseudo-measures of the non-monitored substations. The paper investigates a load modeling technique, based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Fourier decomposition, that allow the generation of pseudo-measurements starting from the historical database of the monitored substations.",

      "abstract": "The great attention of research initiatives to sustainable energy systems calls for contributions in modeling new small size generation plants exploiting innovative technologies. In such a context, the paper presents detailed models of the components and controls forming the thermo-mechanical and electric subsystems of a microturbine power plant. The modeled thermo-mechanical subsystem includes different control loops: a speed controller for primary frequency control (droop control), an acceleration control loop, which limits the rotor acceleration in case of sudden loss of load or in case of start-up, and a controller to limit the temperature of the exhaust gases below the maximum admissible temperature. The modeling of control schemes in the electric subsystem is another key issue of the paper in view of providing efficient energy production from distributed generation: an active power-voltage (PV) control is adopted for the inverter in case of the operation of a microturbine connected to the grid. This control scheme provides an innovative contribution with respect to the usually adopted active power-reactive power (PQ) control scheme. The adoption of the PV control scheme allows to evaluate the contribution of micro-turbines to voltage support in electric distribution grids. In case of isolated operation of the generation source a voltage-frequency (VF) control scheme is proposed. A test grid is set up for model validation and the simulation results are described and discussed. © 2010 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The increase of DG penetration in the distribution networks makes more and more interesting the investigation of security issues which are typical of the large transmission grids (transient stability, voltage stability and small signal stability) as well as the study of the DG responses to load changes in the grid. This paper presents the model of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) dedicated to perform dynamic simulations on MV distribution networks. In particular in the present paper transient stability and load following issues are tackled. The first part of the paper is aimed at describing the model of the SOFC which is then used in the test system. As also a gas turbine is inserted into the test system, a brief look at the gas turbine model is mandatory. The aforementioned models include both the slow dynamics (GT prime mover, electrochemical system time constants for SOFC) necessary to study the DG response to load variations and the fast dynamics (e.g the power converter control and protection systems for SOFCs) necessary to study the transient stability related issues. The results of the analysis (carried out on a test MV distribution network) are reported and some conclusions are drawn. © 2009 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The interconnection of distributed generators in low voltage (LV) networks, together with storage systems, could cause a substantial change in grid operational practice: currently a rising idea proposes to treat generators, storage systems and even loads as distributed energy resources (DER), able to supply services to the grid and accept on-line requests. To emphasise the advantages of Distributed Generation (DG) it is necessary to face the problem with a system approach. In this work both type of services, namely those provided by each generator and those deriving from the co-ordination of different resources, have been investigated. The option represented by a complex master-slave configuration has been discarded in order to avoid its fast communication and control requirements. Instead a prototype based on a centralised resource management solution and a somewhat plug-and-play functionality for each generator has been developed. For this purpose, different control systems have been implemented in order to act during fast transient dynamics due to random load or configuration changes, or to manage the slow modifications of the system conditions due to daily, weekly and seasonal load variations. The regulators of every distributed resource are requested to give response to fast and unpredictable transient dynamics, i.e. to participate to voltage and frequency regulations, harmonic compensations and phase balancing, while a central dispatcher has been conceived as to periodically update the regulators set-points in order to exploit the capabilities of each distributed resource either for present and foreseen grid operating conditions. For voltage and frequency regulations, a specific droop control algorithm has been designed so to be implemented on board of generators connected to the LV grid by an inverter device. In the conceived scenario, each machine, working in parallel with the others, takes on part of the regulation according to its capabilities. For the optimal update of the distributed resources' operating conditions, the developed central dispatcher incorporates the following main functions: short-term forecast of the power produced by renewable energy sources (RES), short-term load forecast and day-ahead load profile prediction, distribution system state estimation, day-ahead economic dispatching and on-line scheduling of the optimal distributed resources' operating conditions. The developed regulators and central dispatcher prototypes have been installed in a test facility set up at Cesi, where several distributed generators of different technologies, storage devices and loads have been interconnected with secondary LV network that can be arranged in different configurations. Some preliminary experiments have been carried out in order to assess the system performances. In particular, according to the view that the high penetration of DG could become an opportunity rather than a problem, as it is frequently considered, the results of this experimental activity show that distributed resources could be suitably used in order to control grid voltage profiles, power flows, and to handling intentional and unintentional islanding condition after separation of the LV grid from the MV distribution grid. The research activity described in this paper was supported in the framework of a National Research Project named GENDIS 21 - Distributed Generation for the Improvement of Power Quality and Environment.",

Although their duration is very short, they can represent a critical problem for industrial plants, especially for those characterized by the presence of Adjustable Speed Drives or, more generally, of sensitive loads, like Power Electronics devices. In this paper, a Static Series Compensator (SSC) has been connected in a radial network feeding a thyristor bridge rectifier controlled load, for the compensation of voltage sags. The whole system has been simulated with the aid of the electromagnetic code PSCAD-EMTDC and the obtained results show that it is particularly suitable for those cases where the unsymmetrical faults are the responsible for the failure of the thyristor pulse logic, thus resulting in a substantial decrease of the DC voltage.",

Thus, it is necessary to find out new resources to reduce price spikes and volatility, to improve transient stability and congestion management, to increase transfer capacity and to provide ancillary services. Loads that can be interrupted and/or controlled may prove to be profitable for each one or these: purposes. This paper presents and discusses the potential benefits provided by the so-called Interruptible loads (IL) to the electric system.

The guidelines for the realization of a load-shedding scheme for industrial electrical plants based also on advanced artificial intelligence tools such as expert systems are proposed. The expert system is used online to prepare lookup load-shedding tables capable of accounting for actual process conditions. Offline validation of the proposed shedding is then operated by static and/or dynamic simulation. The use of a prototype rule-based expert system is expected to permit the achievement of a better flexibility in the realization of load-shedding schemes for improving the process continuity and management.",

      "abstract": "In the context of power system restructuring, the maintaining of adequate levels of security and reliability will be operated also through direct load control, thus considering load as the potential provider of ancillary services such as Regulation, Load-following, Frequency Responsive Spinning Reserve. In any case load-shedding still remains the ultimate resource for emergency conditions. In the paper several load-shedding schemes for under-frequency operation are examined. Both traditional schemes, based only on frequency thresholds, and adaptive schemes, based on frequency and on its rate of change, are considered. An IEEE test system for reliability analysis is used to compare the behavior of the proposed schemes when selecting different thresholds and percentages of load to be disconnected. Results are reported into detail and considerations on possible advantages and drawbacks also related to the framework provided by the electricity market are presented.",

LFC is an essential ancillary service for maintaining system security and reliability. Two possible approaches can be considered: the implementation of LFC schemes for centralized, hierarchical and pluralistic control with the derivation and inclusion of autonomy operating conditions for each control area and the adoption of dynamic bilateral contracts between generation and distribution companies. The former approach is the object of this paper. The guidelines of the UCTE Organism have been considered in implementing the LFC schemes. A three area, 73 bus test system has been used for comparing the different LFC schemes.

      "abstract": "The increasing complexity of power systems due to their growth, operation close to technical limits, economical constraints and new regulations, calls for the inclusion of dynamic security assessment (DSA) into energy management systems where the overall system control is performed. Recent researches on DSA have shown a significant interest in the accuracy of tools based on hybrid methods, a combination of time domain simulation and transient energy functions. A synthetic review of a hybrid method based procedure, implemented by the authors using a suitably adapted simulation code, is first recalled. Successively the possible application of a tool based on artificial neural networks (ANN) for operating a contingency pre-screening by identifying stable and unstable situations is proposed. The ANN capability of identifying the stable and unstable clusters which may originate after a perturbation is also investigated. The proposed ANN structure has been trained and validated by simulating properly arranged scenarios from a test system constituted by a real size HV network of the Mediterranean area.",

While the former ones are based on the power flow equations, the latter use system algebraic and differential equations; there might be a correlation between the two forms if linearized models are examined. In this paper, several load flow Jacobians are defined and correlated to the linearized system state matrix to show under which conditions there might be contemporaneous singularity. Several cases related to simple electrical systems including elements (static loads under LTC transformers, induction motors and aggregate dynamic loads) that may prove critical for system voltage stability are analytically considered, evidencing how these relationships can be achieved.",

      "abstract": "Advanced Series Compensation made up of thyristor controlled reactors and fixed capacitors takes full advantage from high speed operation of power electronic devices. In this paper, active power flow regulation on a connection between electric areas is examined, so as to wheel exchanges between utilities, improve transmission capacity, and avoid connection overloads; moreover, a control system is proposed to improve damping of electromechanical oscillations between neighbouring areas. Both interventions affect, in different time frames, the connection reactance through thyristor controlling facilities. The two control loops have been tested on sample power systems using a transient stability program.",
