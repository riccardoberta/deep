      "abstract": "Non-active current in the time domain is considered for application to the diagnostics and classification of loads in power grids based on waveform-distortion characteristics, taking as a working example several recordings of the pantograph current in an AC railway system. Data are processed with a deep autoencoder for feature extraction and then clustered via k-means to allow identification of patterns in the latent space. Clustering enables the evaluation of the relationship between the physical meaning and operation of the system and the distortion phenomena emerging in the waveforms during operation. Euclidean distance (ED) is used to measure the diversity and pertinence of observations within pattern groups and to identify anomalies (abnormal distortion, transients, …). This approach allows the classification of new data by assigning data to clusters based on proximity to centroids. This unsupervised method exploiting non-active current is novel and has proven useful for providing data with labels for later supervised learning performed with the 1D-CNN, which achieved a balanced accuracy of 96.46% under normal conditions. ED and 1D-CNN methods were tested on an additional unlabeled dataset and achieved 89.56% agreement in identifying normal states. Additionally, Grad-CAM, when applied to the 1D-CNN, quantitatively identifies the waveform parts that influence the model predictions, significantly enhancing the interpretability of the classification results. This is particularly useful for obtaining a better understanding of load operation, including anomalies that affect grid stability and energy efficiency. Finally, the method has been also successfully further validated for general applicability with data from a different scenario (charging of electric vehicles). The method can be applied to load identification and classification for non-intrusive load monitoring, with the aim of implementing automatic and unsupervised assessment of load behavior, including transient detection, power-quality issues and improvement in energy efficiency.",

      "abstract": "Unlike Li-ion batteries, supercapacitors (SCs) do not use rare or polluting metals, have a life cycle even two orders of magnitude higher than that of batteries, and do not suffer from either runaway effects or extreme temperatures. They therefore represent an eco-friendly and reliable technology, which can replace batteries or accompany them in high power density applications. To support the growing use of SCs in real and real-time applications, accurate characterization even under operating conditions is required. Furthermore, validated circuital and software models are needed to identify the SCs behaviour in dynamic applications. Along slower but highly accurate methods, novel quick, traceable, and effective measurement techniques are required to evaluate SCs’ State of Charge (SoC) and State of Health (SoH) and to promote the uptake of SC and banks in consumer, energy, transport, aerospace and in many other applications. The MetSuperCap project aims to improve the characterisation of SCs and SC banks by providing an accurate and reliable identification of their parameters in the laboratory and in operation.",

A new Radio-Seismic Indicator (RSI) is proposed, with the magnitude-distance relationship physically justified by path-loss expressions of the transverse magnetic mode. Classification performances of past and proposed RSIs are assessed calculating confusion matrices and on those the balanced accuracy and Matthews’ coefficient: the RSI performs significantly better reducing fall-outs and increasing precision for both classes, positive and negative precursors. Performance improvement is inherently limited by the overlap of the classes.",

Such converters are all fed by a common DC grid, representing a promising architecture to allow the increase of EV penetration while better controlling distortion and stability. A network of three WPT converters is analysed under varying alignment, load, and synchronization conditions. The analysis demonstrates that the aggregation of emissions from multiple converters can be effectively managed through careful design of the DC grid, minimizing interference and maintaining overall system stability. Additionally, the results emphasize the significance of accounting for both the coupling coefficient and load conditions to reduce distortion and enhance the performance of the system.",

      "abstract": "Accurate grid impedance measurement is essential for managing modern electrical grids, especially regarding compliance with CISPR standards for EMC emissions. This article presents a network impedance measurement method using a vector network analyzer (VNA) cooperating with two coil probes placed on a section of the tested grid. The method has potential applications for real-time network monitoring and EMC compliance; hence it can be used to detect faults in real grids. A minimally sized artificial network is proposed to test the correctness of this method. This artificial network can also be used to optimise the measurement system, including selecting coils for operation in a given frequency range.",

      "abstract": "This work proposes an application of unsupervised deep learning (DL) on 2-D images containing VI diagrams of measured railway pantograph quantities to find patterns in operating conditions (OCs) and waveform distortion. Measurement data consist of pantograph voltage and current measurements from a Swiss 15 kV 16.7 Hz commercial locomotive and a French 2x25 kV 50 Hz test-dedicated locomotive, containing more than 4000 records of 5-cycle snippets for each system. The variational autoencoder (VAE), followed by feature clustering, finds patterns in the input data. Each cluster captures patterns from the VI diagrams, which contain information from current and voltage waveshapes and sub-second variations. The time-domain admittance allows inference about the rolling stock (RS) operation and the waveform distortion spectra, including harmonics and supraharmonics characteristics from both RS and traction supply. The VAE successfully performs data embedding using only 16 channels in the latent space. The effectiveness of the method is quantified by means of the mean square reconstruction error (never larger than 1.5% and equal to 0.31% and 0.33% on average for the Swiss and French case, respectively). The t-SNE visualization confirms that overlapping of clusters is negligible, with a percentage of “misplaced” cluster points of 2.18% and 2.50%, again for the Swiss and French case, respectively. The computation time for the VAE prediction could be brought to some tens of ms representing a performance reference for future implementations. The proposed VI diagram assessment covers emissions for different OCs, rapid changes in power supply conditions, and background distortion caused by other trains on the same line, including line and impedance changes due to the moving load. In this perspective physical justification is found by domain knowledge integration for the identified clusters. A concluding discussion regarding advantages, limitations, and potential improvements or diversification is also included.",

      "abstract": "Estimating line impedance is relevant in transmission and distribution networks, in particular for planning and control. The large number of deployed PMUs has fostered the use of passive indirect methods based on network model identification. Electrified railways are a particular example of a distribution network, with moving highly dynamic loads, that would benefit from line impedance information for energy efficiency and optimization purposes, but for which many of the methods used in industrial applications cannot be directly applied. The estimate is carried out onboard using a passive method in a single-point perspective, suitable for implementation with energy metering onboard equipment. A comparison of two methods is carried out based on the non-linear least mean squares (LMS) optimization of an over-determined system of equations and on the auto- and cross-spectra of the pantograph voltage and current. The methods are checked preliminarily with a simulated synthetic network, showing good accuracy, within 5%. They are then applied to measured data over a 20 min run over the Swiss (Formula presented.) Hz railway network. Both methods are suitable to track network impedance in real time during the train journey; but with suitable checks on the significance of the pantograph current and on the values of the coefficient of determination, the LMS method seems more reliable with predictable behavior.",

Diagnostic and prognostic programs are thus quite useful and this work shows a novel approach based on the analysis of spectra of an autoregressive (AR) model to recognize a wide range of faulty devices, including incipient faults, when deviations from nominal parameters begin to manifest. AR modeling provides cleaner and easier to interpret spectra, where only the salient features remain, and they are more sensitive to variations in the corresponding time domain waveforms. A log spectral distance is calculated that successfully separates healthy and faulty states of the feeding single-phase inverter, even in challenging scenarios of poor signal-to-noise ratio.",

      "abstract": "The demonstration of compliance of rolling stock against disturbance limits for railway signaling, and in particular track circuits, is subject to a large deal of variability, caused by the diverse values of the electrical parameters of the railway line and resulting transfer functions, as well as the operating conditions of the rolling stock during tests. Instrumental uncertainty is evaluated with a type B approach and shown to be much less than the experimental variability. Repeated test runs in acceleration, coasting, cruising, and braking conditions are considered, deriving both max-hold (spread) and sample (or experimental) standard deviation curves compared to the respective mean values (type A approach to the evaluation of uncertainty, as defined in of the Guide to the Uncertainty in Measurement. The major source of variability affecting a significant portion of the spectrum is caused by the superposed oscillations of the onboard LC filter, for which different choices of the transformation window duration are discussed. The test runs and the acquired data covered, overall, 1 day of tests along about 300 km of the Italian 3 kV DC railway network.",

      "abstract": "The phenomenon of high-frequency distortion (HFD) in the electric grids, at both low-voltage (LV) and medium-voltage (MV) levels, is gaining increasing interest within the scientific and technical community due to its growing occurrence and the associated impact. These disturbances are mainly injected into the grid by new installed devices, essential for achieving decentralized generation based on renewable sources. In fact, these generation systems are connected to the grid through power converters, whose switching frequencies are significantly increasing, leading to a corresponding rise in the frequency of the injected disturbances. HFD represents a quite recent issue, but numerous scientific papers have been published in recent years on this topic. Furthermore, various international standards have also covered it, to provide guidance on instrumentation and related algorithms and indices for the measurement of these phenomena. When measuring HFD in MV grids, it is necessary to use instrument transformers (ITs) to scale voltages and currents to levels fitting with the input stages of power quality (PQ) instruments. In this respect, the recently released Edition 2 of the IEC 61869-1 standard extends the concept of the IT accuracy class up to 500 kHz; however, the IEC 61869 standard family provides guidelines on how to test ITs only at power frequency. This paper provides an extensive review of literature, standards, and the main outputs of European research projects focusing on HFD and ITs. This preliminary study of the state-of-the-art represents an essential starting point for defining significant waveforms to test ITs and, more generally, to achieve a comprehensive understanding of HFD. In this framework, this paper provides a summary of the most common ranges of amplitude and frequency variations of actual HFD found in real grids, the currently adopted measurement methods, and the normative open challenges to be addressed.",

      "abstract": "Since the integration of electronic devices and intelligent electronic devices into the power grid, power quality (PQ) has consistently remained a significant concern for system operators and experts. Maintaining high standards of power quality is crucial to preventing malfunctions and faults in electric assets and connected loads. Recently, PQ studies have shifted their focus to a specific frequency range, previously not considered problematic—the supraharmonic 2 kHz to 150 kHz range. This range is not populated by easily recognizable harmonic components of the 50 Hz to 60 Hz mains fundamental, but by a combination of intentional emissions, switching non-linearities and byproducts, and various types of resonances. This paper aims to provide a detailed analysis of the impact of supraharmonics (SHs) on power network operation and assets, focusing on the most relevant documented negative effects, namely power loss and the heating of grid elements, aging of dielectric materials, failure of medium voltage (MV) cable terminations, and interference with equipment and power line communication (PLC) technology in particular. Under some shareable assumptions, limits are derived and compared to existing ones for harmonic phenomena, providing a clear identification of the primary issues associated with supraharmonics and suggestions for the standardization process. Strictly related is the problem of grid monitoring and assessment of SH distortion, discussing the suitability of normative requirements for instrument transformers (ITs) with a specific focus on their accuracy.",

      "abstract": "Conducted emissions are strongly dependent on the grid and EUT impedance, to measure in live conditions. A portable system based on a low-cost VNA and two internal or external current probes is presented. It was verified in the lab against various calibration standards (50 Ω, mismatched termination, 150 Ω coupling-decoupling network and 100 pF capacitor) using a Agilent E5061B as reference. Results of calibration and the effects of probes non-linearity are provided, having considered both saturation (with an external bias circuit) and signal-to-noise ratio (by injecting external noise). The maximum observed spread of impedance magnitude is 1% for matched condition (50 Ω) and 10% in mismatched conditions. Performance can always be improved by using a more expensive and bulkier VNA.",

      "abstract": "Modelling converters in DC grids for supraharmonic emissions is crucial for understanding their impact on power quality. These emissions, occurring at frequencies above traditional harmonics, can disrupt grid stability and require accurate representation. Models must capture the behaviour of converters for different operating conditions, accounting their non-linearities and interactions with the grid. This involves characterising primary and secondary emissions, as well as their propagation through the network. Advanced simulation techniques are employed to assess the combined effects of multiple converters and evaluate mitigation strategies. By accurately modelling converter emissions, researchers can develop effective measures to ensure the reliability and efficiency of DC grids.",

The analysis for harmonics, interharmonics and supraharmonics up to 25 kHz is carried out using Fryze’s power theory and separating active and non-active current signals. Larger non-active components in the harmonic interval are found at low power levels, whereas active current becomes prevalent when tractioning at high power. Supraharmonics instead have a prevalence of active current, that is relevant to the estimate of power losses and energy efficiency. The current signals were also subject to clustering using unsupervised deep learning, synthesizing the behavior of more than 5000 current snapshots of 300 ms duration with only 5 distinct patterns.",

To support the increasing use of SCs, accurate characterization is required under operating conditions. In addition, validated circuital and software models are needed to identify the SCs behavior in dynamic applications. Along with slower but highly accurate methods, novel quick, traceable, and effective measurement techniques are required to evaluate SCs State of Charge (SoC) and State of Health (SoH) and to promote the uptake of SCs in consumer electronics, energy, transport, aerospace and in many other applications.

The project goals are aimed to cover several charging modes, such as direct DC charging at low and high power, smart charging and specialised bi-directional charging. The European research project “Metrology for Electric Vehicle Charging Systems”, which will start in July 2024, will support the industry needs through the development of a pan-European infrastructure for traceable testing of EVCSs, which remains a major bottleneck at the moment. The project will also provide input to OIML/TC12, WELMEC/WG11 and the European Commission Working group WgMI E01349 for uptake in their guidelines and regulations, which will, in turn, support the EV charging industry through standardisation.",

      "abstract": "Stray currents can cause very rapid degradation and material loss at the points where the current leaves the metal and enters the electrolyte. Nowadays, many resources are invested in the protection of jeopardized structures, such as buried pipelines, from stray current corrosion. This paper describes the measures that need to be considered in the design and construction of track structures to ensure high rail-to-ground resistance and consequently reduce stray currents. The main conclusions from existing guidelines and standards for reducing and controlling stray currents that are applied by various track operators are presented in the paper. Rail-to-ground resistance in different types of tracks structures and rail fastening systems is analyzed, and the optimal type of the track and type of the fastening system is defined. The grounding schemes used on the tracks and their influence on stray current values are described, as well as the influence of traction power stations (TPS) and rail cross bonding on stray current. Since it is not necessary to apply all the measures described to the same track structure, the paper gives recommendations on which measures to apply when building tracks with continuously fastened rails and which to apply when building tracks with discretely supported and fastened rails.",

      "abstract": "Stray current is a relevant phenomenon in particular for DC electrified transportation systems, affecting track and infrastructure within the right of way and other structures and installations nearby. It worsens with time and the level of protection depends on timely maintenance, as well as correct design choices. The assessment of track insulation is the starting point for both stray current monitoring systems and at commissioning or upon major changes. Standardized methods (ref. EN 50122-2 or IEC 62128-2) have been almost unchanged in the last 20 years but suffer from accuracy issues and variability due to parameters and conditions not under the operator’s control. The uncertainty of test methods is increasingly important now that contractual specifications require a high level of insulation for new systems. A critical discussion and analysis of the sources of variability and practical constraints is proposed, followed by an evaluation of uncertainty, with the objective not only to assess the accuracy of the provided results, but also to foster research on innovative, more flexible and accurate methods.",

      "abstract": "A contactless position sensor based on an array of magnetically coupled resonators and an external single coil cell is discussed for both stationary and dynamic applications. The simple structure allows the sensor to be adapted to the system in which it is installed and can be used to detect the positions of objects in motion that bear an external resonator coil that does not necessitate a supply. By exploiting the unique behaviour of the array input impedance, it is possible to identify the position of the external resonator by exciting the first array cell with an external voltage source and measuring the resulting input current. The system is robust and suitable for application in harsh environments. The sensitivity of the measured input impedance to the space variation is adjustable with the definition of the array geometry and is analysed. Different configurations of the array and external resonator are considered, and the effects of various termination conditions and the resulting factor of merit after changing the coil resistance are discussed. The proposed procedure is numerically validated for an array of ten identical magnetically coupled resonators with 15 cm side lengths. Simulations carried out for a distance of up to 20 cm show that, with a quality factor lower than 100 and optimal terminations of both the array and external coil, it is possible to detect the position of the latter.",

      "abstract": "Energy efficiency is more and more important for modern electrified transportation systems, requiring an understanding of the various indexes of performance (regenerability, receptivity, and energy losses, thus including braking recovered energy and energy loss in catenary) and of the influence of the main system parameters (headway, line voltage, substation separation, etc.). By means of electromechanical simulation, the most relevant parameters and system conditions are identified as influencing the efficiency performance and optimization capability. Besides the assessment of such efficiency performance indexes, identifying their typical ranges of variation, one further outcome is the identification of characteristic system parameter combinations that lead to extreme variations in the system energy efficiency itself. Such peculiar variations are caused by occasionally synchronized patterns of trains along the line and result in a significant local increase or decrease in efficiency. Efficiency drop scenarios in particular should be taken into consideration for worst-case analysis and to devise effective mitigations. To this aim, the effect of differently distributed passenger stations is considered.",

      "abstract": "Electromagnetic emissions from earthquakes are known as precursors and are of considerable importance for the purpose of early alarms. The propagation of low-frequency waves is favored, and the range between tens of mHz to tens of Hz has been heavily investigated in the last thirty years. This work describes the self-financed Opera 2015 project that initially consisted of six monitoring stations over Italy, equipped with electric and magnetic field sensors, among others. Insight of the designed antennas and low-noise electronic amplifiers provides both characterization of performance (similar to the best commercial products) and the elements to replicate the design for our own independent studies. Measured signals through data acquisition systems were then processed for spectral analysis and are available on the Opera 2015 website. Data provided by other world-known research institutes have also been considered for comparison. The work provides examples of processing methods and results representation, identifying many exogenous noise contributions of natural or human-made origin. The study of the results occurred for some years and led us to think that reliable precursors are confined to a short area around the earthquake due to the significant attenuation and the effect of overlapping noise sources. To this aim, a magnitude-distance indicator was developed to classify the detectability of the EQ events observed during 2015 and compared this with some other known earthquake events documented in the scientific literature.",

      "abstract": "Electric arcing is an unavoidable consequence of the current collection process by sliding contact in railways and metros, and in general in many electrified transportation systems (ETSs). The most relevant consequences in an electrical perspective are: the occurrence of transients triggering resonant behaviour and transient responses, reduction of the energy efficiency of the system, conducted and radiated disturbance, in particular for the new radio systems widely employed for signalling and communication. The involved parameters are many (type of materials, current intensity, DC and AC supply, relative speed, temperature), as well as the studied characteristics (arc instability and lifetime, dynamic behaviour, electrical system response, radiation efficiency and coupling to external radio systems). This work reports the state of the art in arc modelling, arcing experimental characterisation, interaction with the supply system, radiated emissions and disturbance to radio systems, providing a complete description of phenomena and of reference data, critically discussing similarity and differences between sources. Proposed arc models are many with different assumptions and simplifications for various applications, so that a critical review and discussion are a necessity, considering the many different approaches and not-so-obvious applicability. The comparison with experimental results highlights unavoidable discrepancies, also because of intrinsic arc variability and for the many involved parameters and operating conditions. The impact of the arc as embedded in the railway system is then considered, speaking of conducted and radiated phenomena, including interference to radio communication systems and arc detection. The most prominent effect for conducted emissions is the excitation of system resonances, including the LC filters onboard rolling stock and substations in DC railways, with consequences for disturbance and energy efficiency, and this is discussed in detail. Conversely, for high frequency emissions, the attenuation along the line circuit is significant and the effective distance of propagation is limited; nevertheless radiated electromagnetic field emissions are a relevant source of disturbance for radio systems within the ETS premises and outside (e.g., at airports). The published approaches to quantify performance reduction are discussed with emphasis on experimental methods.",

      "abstract": "An investigation of noise interference caused by waveform distortion in lineside railway systems has been performed. The measurements used to perform the assessment are from rolling stocks operating in 15 kV 16.7 Hz grids, both from Switzerland and Germany. This work assesses pantograph measurements from different rolling stocks using “psophometric” indices covering the range of 16 2/3 Hz to 25 kHz. The main proposal is to calculate the psophometric current variation using different ITU-T K.68 and C-message curves that qualify the human ear sensitivity. The contribution of separated waveform distortion (harmonics, interharmonics, and supraharmonics) is estimated through the weighted spectra. The outcomes highlight the differences between indices and a framework of evaluation for the interference to lineside systems caused by waveform distortion in railways, including statistical/probabilistic evaluation.",

One major factor affecting the reliable assessment of emissions in the supraharmonic frequency interval (2 kHz to 150 kHz) is the definition of the supply conditions namely the feeding impedance; in addition, emissions in this frequency range are a mix of differential- and common-mode emissions, with prevalence of the former. It is demonstrated that supply impedance values at the EV charger connection may be highly variable depending on network loading and location of the other connected EV chargers: some scenarios of small and medium extension of the DC network are evaluated, showing peculiar frequency intervals where emissions could vary by as much as 20 dB simply as the consequence of connection and disconnection of other EVs.",

      "abstract": "More and more often overall energy efficiency of an electrified transportation system appears as a target of new constructions, sometimes with incomplete definitions of performance indexes to assess that target has been reached. A worked out example is based on the introduction of reversible substations. Reversible substations are a method to improve energy efficiency, whose application in an existing system can be progressive and does not require large traffic intensity to be effective. Their effectiveness depends on some system parameters (nominal catenary voltage in particular). A simulation model fed with experimental data from a line section of Metro de Madrid is used to demonstrate the operation and optimization of reversible substations. Background: The ambitious reduction of CO<inf>2</inf> greenhouse gas emission within 2050 declared by the European Commission also involves transportation systems. In this context an optimum recovery of the electric braking energy produced by railway vehicles is more and more relevant. Several strategies to completely recover the braking energy are being developed and applied. A methodology that allows the accurate determination of the amount of recovered energy in real operating conditions becomes then a valuable tool. Objective: Reversible substations are one of the braking energy recovery methods that are widely applicable. Their effect is analyzed in a system perspective, considering them integrated into the transportation system with its dynamics and various operating points. The effectiveness and consequences of the operation of one or more reversible substations are evaluated by identifying relevant system conditions and scenarios. Methods: An electric network model is provided, fed by measured timetable and traction current. Simulation results are analyzed and compared with some experimental results: simulation configurations will be selected to match those of the available experimental data. Results: The selected substation's no-load output voltage level has a significant effect on the efficiency and performance of reversible substations. A reduction of 50 V, from 1700 V to 1650 V produces a decrease of the energy dissipated by the braking rheostat on-board trains of about 13%. The voltage increase caused during braking phases is kept under control better for track positions close to reversible substations: tests show that line voltage increase is 2.5% of nominal value with a reversible substation and only 0.5% when it is operated. Trimming the thresholds that trigger the operation of the on-board braking chopper (intermingling regenerative and dissipative braking) has a dramatic effect on regenerability: a reduction of 50 V causes an improvement of 19%. Conclusion: The paper presents a methodology that merges measurements and circuital model to investigate the energy saving provided by reversible substations supplying railway system. The methodology has been applied to a real case. Preliminary results regarding the impact of supply voltage level, reversible module position and threshold levels of the braking chopper control system on the dissipated braking energy and power quality has been carried out.",

      "abstract": "The FSV method is a recognized validation tool that initially assesses the similarity between data sets for electromagnetic measurements and models. Its use may be extended to many problems and applications, and in particular, with relation to electrical systems, but it should be characterized in terms of its uncertainty, as for measurement tools. To this aim, the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM) is applied for the propagation of uncertainty from the experimental data to the Feature Selective Validation (FSV) quantities, using Monte Carlo analysis as confirmation, which ultimately remains the most reliable approach to determine the propagation of uncertainty, given the significant FSV non-linearity. Such non-linearity in fact compromises the accuracy of the Taylor approximation supporting the use of first-order derivatives (and derivative terms in general). MCM results are instead more stable and show sensitivity vs. input data uncertainty in the order of 10 to 100, highly depending on the local data samples value. To this aim, normalized sensitivity coefficients are also reported, in an attempt to attenuate the scale effects, redistributing the observed sensitivity values that, however, remain in the said range, up to about 100.",

      "abstract": "Power converters for wireless power transfer (WPT) and, in general, for electrical vehicle charging are evolving in terms of nominal power and performance, bringing along non negligible emissions in the supraharmonic range (2 kHz to 150 kHz). The large installed power and the high concentration with a relatively short separation distance can be addressed by feeding the converters through a DC grid for better dynamic response and lower impedance. The prediction of conducted emissions in real supply conditions requires carrying out measurements with low impedance values, lower than those available in line impedance stabilization networks (LISNs) for AC grids. This work proposes an approach to extrapolate converter emissions in an ideal 0 Ω condition, that together with the input impedance curve (determined by a least mean square approach) form a Norton equivalent circuit of the converter. The interaction of the converters with the DC grid and superposition of emissions can be then thoroughly evaluated by means of a general ladder grid scheme to which the Norton equivalents are connected. Such a grid model is suitable for Monte Carlo simulation aimed at assessing the degree of compensation between sources of emissions and the overall network distortion. Results using a Simulink model are provided considering emissions aggregation and compensation under random phase conditions for the following cases: close-by and separated sources (5 m and 100 m cable separation, respectively); increased number of sources studying scenarios with 3 and 10 sources; and using different resolution bandwidth values (200 Hz and 500 Hz) against a random change of the frequency of the emission components.",

This work studies the applicability and effectiveness for AC railways, considering the highly dynamic behavior of rolling stock as an electric load, immersed in varying contexts of moving loads. Both voltage–current diagrams and harmonic spectra were considered for identification and extraction of features relevant to classification and clustering. Principal components were extracted, approaching the problem using principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least square regression (PLSR). Clustering methods were then discussed, verifying separability performance and applicability to the railway context, checking the performance by means of the balanced accuracy index. Based on more than one hundred measured spectra, PLSR has been confirmed with superior performance and lower complexity. Independent verification based on dispersion and correlation were used to spot relevant spectrum components to use as clustering features and confirm the PLSR outcome.",

      "abstract": "Electric vehicle (EV) charging represents a relevant electric load with a rapid evolution in terms of number, power rating and distortion, in particular, considering the connection to the low-voltage public grid: available short-circuit power may be limited and particularly susceptible loads may co-exist in the same grid portion. Standards can partially address the problem cover-ing only the harmonic interval, but they necessitate significant extension and improvement in the supraharmonic range. In addition, EV chargers have been observed to violate in some scenarios the applicable harmonic limits, so that the mechanisms of emission and distortion should be better understood and evaluated, including phenomena of mutual influence between EV chargers and with pre-existing grid distortion. Although models can help simulate large-scale scenarios in terms of fundamental frequency phenomena, such as power flow, voltage fluctuation and imbalance, sub-stantial and reliable information can come from experimental results, providing measured harmonic and supraharmonic emissions, accompanied by details on loads mix, grid characteristics and EV charger operating conditions. This work thus defines the applicable constraints in terms of limits and compatibility levels for public and light industrial low-voltage grids, discusses the available experimental results and datasets, analyzing the typical distortion behavior and providing indication of sources of information for further studies.",

Given the peculiar emission waveform (mixing impulsive components and switching components), assessment should be carried out with care to select parameters that guarantee both the detection of the maximum level of emissions and a high level of repeatability and reproducibility. A range of cases based on six different SMPS products was considered, exploring both time-and frequency-domain characteristics, and identifying the most relevant phenomena and advisable parameters choices. Typical behavior and suitable settings were exemplified with a range of measured emission records: the Fourier time window length and EMI receiver dwell time were considered, as well as the relevance of loading conditions to include in a comprehensive test program. Such records were made available in a linked dataset to allow for replication of the experiments and foster further findings and discussion.",

      "abstract": "In areas where urban tracks are used as public transportation, dynamic stray currents cause high maintenance costs for the tracks and metal structures near the tracks. Stray currents caused by rail vehicles depend on many factors (traffic density, vehicle speed, acceleration and deceleration, soil and track moisture), so it is very difficult to get a clear picture of the harmfulness of the stray current based on the results of a single field measurement. However, there are several measurement methods that can be used to determine the presence of stray currents and predict appropriate track maintenance actions. Some of these methods are described in this article, namely the use of stray current mapper, measurement of rail potential and rail current, measurement at the stray current collection system, and the use of non-destructive sensors. In track construction, measuring the electrical potential between rail and ground is one of the most common methods of detecting the damaging inf luence of stray current.",

This requires long and complicated measures to ensure all the transient components to be correctly assessed. The analysis and classification of SMPS CE is addressed by employing an artificial neural network (ANN), with the aim of discriminate the part of the measured disturbance that is strongly affected by transient components and highlight the most relevant features of the CE spectrum.

      "abstract": "The reported higher levels of conducted emissions in DC grids in the 2-150 kHz range are caused by the spectral aggregations resulting from the converter's switching harmonics. The dominant influence for these spectral aggregates is the impedance correlation between the DC-link capacitor and the converters. This paper analyses the impedance interaction & comparability between the DC-link and the DC/DC converters at the point of common coupling in the DC grid. Simulations with four DC-link capacitors and forty parallel DC/DC converters are conducted, with full (non-linear) and equivalent-source (linear) models for comparison. The dBµV values for the first spectral aggregate decrease as the augmenting DC-side impedance becomes comparable with the smaller DC-link impedance, lowering the electromagnetic interference in the DC grid. This understanding may provide insights into the DC-link capacitor design from an electromagnetic compatibility perspective, and towards developing a framework for DC power quality standards in the 2-150 kHz range.",

      "abstract": "Waveform distortion in general represents a widespread problem in electrified transports due to interference, service disruption, increased losses, and aging of components. Given the multitude of moving sources and the extremely variable operating conditions, short-time records must be considered for analysis, and this increases in turn its complexity, from which the need for effective automated processing, as offered by a deep learning (DL) approach. This article proposes an application of unsupervised DL to measurements of railway pantograph quantities to identify waveform distortion patterns. Data consist of pantograph current from a Swiss 15-kV 16.7-Hz railway system. Three DL input types are considered: waveforms, harmonic spectra, and supraharmonic spectra. The applied DL method applied is the deep autoencoder (DAE) followed by feature clustering, using techniques to define a suitable number of clusters. Short-term distortion is evaluated over sub-10-min intervals of harmonic and supraharmonic spectra down to subsecond intervals. Results are explained among others by connecting the distribution of the clusters (determined by the self-supervised method) to the dynamic operating conditions of the rolling stock. The resulting DAE performance is superior in terms of accuracy and comprehensiveness of spectral components compared to a more traditional principal component analysis (PCA) that was chosen as a reference for comparison.",

      "abstract": "The measurement of conducted emissions of switched mode power supplies (SMPSs) is discussed for the 2-1000-kHz frequency range, analyzing variability caused by setup elements and test conditions. The tested SMPSs have 12-VDC output and about 20-W nominal power. They are fed by a controlled ac power supply, instead of mains, through a line impedance stabilization network and various loading levels are applied. Identified causes of variability (supply voltage and frequency variations, thermal stabilization influencing internal mechanisms of emissions) indicate a relevant impact on the spread of measured conducted emissions, ranging from a fraction of decibels to about 10 dB (sample standard deviation). Such phenomena represent a cause first of all of systematic error, but also of increased uncertainty. No EMC standards are known to take them into account, nor the scientific literature reports extensive quantification, as in the present case. The shift of the line spectrum of emission consequential to a mains frequency change revealed to be exploitable also for better identification of internal sources of emission.",

The paper considers the issue of stray current mitigation discussing what can be done for design and existing systems, sticking to applicable standards and consolidated protection practice. Mitigation measures may be devised for a new constructed system, such as the optimization of traction substation positions, reducing the longitudinal resistance of the running rails and return circuit, and using an additional stray current collection system (to be included in the track bed during construction). As for an existing system, besides increasing the total cross section of the aforementioned return circuit and stray current collection system by adding parallel conductors or cross-bonds, it is recommended to employ static converter units (e.g. negative resistance converters) to control the stray current in the return circuit. These units can be deployed in specific points where analysis or measurement indicates the large rail potential or incipient corrosion is spotted out.",

      "abstract": "This work addresses the problem of power quality (PQ) metrics (or indexes) suitable for DC grids, encompassing low and medium voltage applications, including electric transports, all-electric ships and aircrafts, electric vehicles, distributed generation and microgrids, modern data centers, etc. The two main pillars on which such PQ indexes are discussed and built are: (i) the physical justification, so the electric phenomena affecting DC grids and components (PV panels, fuel cells, capacitors, batteries, etc.), causing, e.g., stress of materials, aging, distortion, grid insta-bility; and (ii) the existing standardization framework, pointing out desirable coverage and exten-sion, similarity with AC grids standards, but also inconsistencies. For the first point, each phe-nomenon is discussed with quantitative conclusions on relevant thresholds: in many cases some percentage of distortion (ripple) is acceptable (stress on capacitors and storage, impact on fuel cells, and PV panels), whereas in other cases, much higher levels may be tolerated (interference to protection and monitoring devices). Standards are reviewed for indications not only of low-order harmonics and voltage fluctuations typical of old DC grid schemes, but also for high-frequency noise, including thus supraharmonics and common-mode disturbance, and filling the gap with the electromagnetic compatibility domain. However, phenomena typical of EMC and electrical safety (such as various types of overvoltages and fast transients) are excluded. Suitable PQ indexes are then reviewed, suggesting integrations and modifications, to cover the relevant phenomena and technological progress, and to better follow the normative exigencies: ripple is considered in time and frequency domain, in particular with a band limited implementation; for transients and pulsed loads, more traditional indexes based on area, energy, and half duration are confronted with indexes evaluating the power trajectory and its derivative.",

      "abstract": "Electromagnetic field emissions of modern power systems have increased in complexity if the many power conversion forms by means of power electronics and static converters are con-sidered. In addition, the installed electric power has grown in many everyday applications such as wireless charging of vehicles, home integrated photovoltaic systems, high-performance electrified transportation systems, and so on. Attention must then be shifted to include harmonics and com-mutation components on one side, as well as closer interaction with humans, that concretizes in impact on physiological functions and interference to implantable medical devices and hearing aids. The panorama is complex in that standards and regulations have also increased significantly or underwent extensive revisions in the last 10 years or so. For assessment, the straightforward application of the limits of exposure is hindered by measurement problems (time or frequency domain methods, positioning errors, impact of uncertainty) and complex scenarios of exposure (multiple sources, large field gradient, time-varying emissions). This work considers thus both the clarification of the principles of interaction for each affected system (including humans) and the discussion of the large set of related normative and technical documents, deriving a picture of requirements and constraints. The methods of assessment are discussed in a metrological perspec-tive using a range of examples.",

The range was selected to cover supraharmonics and the most relevant RF conducted emissions. Tests were carried out on a 220 VAC/ 12 VDC SMPS fed by a Line Impedance Stabilization Network and varying the loading conditions. The most significant aspects are resolution bandwidth (which is still currently not completely standardized), the stability of the mains fundamental frequency and the dependency of the mechanisms of emission from the thermal transients inside the SMPS, as well as for the applied load. Short-and long-Term variability are thus analyzed to verify the minimum conditions for thermal stabilization.",

      "abstract": "Harmonic resonances are part of the power quality (PQ) problems of electrified railways and have serious consequences for the continuity of service and integrity of components in terms of overvoltage stress. The interaction between traction power stations (TPSs) and trains that causes line resonances is briefly reviewed, showing the dependence on infrastructure conditions. The objective is monitoring of resonance conditions at the onboard pantograph interface, which is new with respect to the approaches proposed in the literature and is equally applicable to TPS terminals. Voltage and current spectra, and derived impedance and power spectra, are analyzed, proposing a compact and efficient method based on short-time Fourier transform that is suitable for real-time implementation, possibly with the hardware available onboard for energy metering and harmonic interference monitoring. The methods are tested by sweeping long recordings taken at some European railways, covering cases of longer and shorter supply sections, with a range of resonance frequencies of about one decade. They give insight into the spectral behavior of resonances, their dependency on position and change over time, and the criteria needed to recognize genuine infrastructure resonances from rolling stock emissions.",

Passengers may interact with PSDs and platforms while boarding, leaving, and waiting for trains. Typical contractual requirements and applicable standards are discussed, identifying touch voltage scenarios suitably defining electrical circuits and parameters. The dc voltage limits are at all clear and unambiguous in the range of relevant touch voltage values. The evaluation of exposure is, thus, carried out with the help of body impedance and body current models. Solutions are then discussed for the protection of PSDs and passengers, including stray current limitations as a constraint. A novel PSD bonding arrangement is proposed, which reconciles insulation for utmost electrical safety level and bonding for traction fault protection.",

The identification of regulatory limits for PPL integration and DC grid response and the assessment of PPL impact necessitate suitable Power Quality (PQ) metrics. Existing indexes and limits (e.g. ripple and distortion, voltage fluctuation) are compared to other metrics, derived from control methods and knowledge of the peculiar characteristics of PPL and interaction with DC grids in some examples. The objective is a unified approach for PQ metrics suitable for a wide range of DC grids and in particular to the behavior of PPLs.",

Emissions are substantially impulsive and oscillatory superposed to the mains signal, possibly featuring multiple switching fundamentals and their harmonics with unstable or purposely changing fundamental frequency. Fourier analysis (namely Discrete Fourier Transform) is commonly used to characterize the spectrum of emissions from time-domain data, but the influence of its settings should be verified for accuracy and systematic errors, so to establish the uncertainty of spectral estimates. After an initial theoretical and practical discussion of characteristics, objectives and weak points, a verification is carried out with the help of several measurements performed in different operating conditions on a set of six different SMPSs, evaluating systematic error and uncertainty, and defining a set of recommendations.",

Herein, it is shown that correlation and clustering can separate distortion terms of internal and external origin also without a priori information. The use of harmonic power terms (product of voltage and current components) shows improved robustness with respect to the analysis of the voltage and current components alone.",

      "abstract": "Accurate and comprehensive methods for the assessment of radiated electromagnetic emissions in modern electric transportation systems are a necessity. The characteristics and susceptibility of modern victim signaling and communication radio services, operating within and outside the right-of-way, require an update of the measurement methods integrating or replacing the swept frequency technique with time domain approaches. Applicable standards are the EN 50121 (equivalent to the IEC 62236) and Urban Mass Transport Association (UMTA) with additional specifications from project contracts. This work discusses the standardized methods and settings, and the representative operating conditions, highlighting areas where improvements are possible and opportune (statistical characterization of measurement results, identification and distinction of emissions and line resonances, and narrowband and broadband phenomena). In particular for the Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) assessment with new Digital Communication Systems, the characterization of time distribution of spectral properties is discussed, e.g., by means of Amplitude Probability Distribution and including time distribution information. The problem of determination of site and setup uncertainty and repeatability is also discussed, observing on one hand the lack of clear indications in standards and, on the other hand, the non-ideality and intrinsic variability of measurement conditions (e.g., rolling stock operating conditions, synchronization issues, and electric arc intermittence).",

      "abstract": "Running rails in electrified transportation systems are the interface element for several phenomena related to system performance, electromagnetic compatibility and safety: useful voltage at rolling stock, short circuit current, induced voltage, stray current, and track circuit operation. This work presents the physical and mathematical groundings of rail electrical parameters (DC and AC resistance, AC internal and external inductance) and experimental results available in the literature, discussing variability and reliability for each interface. The results consist thus of the identification of the relevant rails longitudinal electrical parameters, the presentation of a set of reliable experimental values, and the discussion of the best approach to manage their variability and uncertainty.",

      "abstract": "Switched-Mode Power Supplies (SMPSs) are a relevant source of conducted emissions, in particular in the frequency interval of supraharmonics, between 2 kHz and 150 kHz. When using sampled data for assessment of compliance, methods other than Fourier analysis should be considered for better frequency resolution, compact signal energy decomposition and a shorter time support. This work investigates the application of the Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT) and the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) to measured recordings of SMPS conducted emissions, featuring steep impulses and damped oscillations. The comparison shows a general accuracy of the amplitude estimate within the variability of data themselves, with very good performance of WPT in tracking on stationary components in the low frequency range at some kHz. WPT performance however may vary appreciably depending on the selected mother wavelet for which some examples are given. EMD and its Ensemble EMD implementation show a fairly good accuracy in representing the original signal with a very limited number of base functions with the capability of exploiting a filtering effect on the low-frequency components of the signal.",

      "abstract": "Electrified transportation systems (ETSs) are affected by stray current problems impacting within and outside the right of way on reinforcement, buried metal structures and foundations. Stray current protection systems have recently been integrated in the track structure. Track electrical quantities are, thus, usually measured to assess track insulation and protection efficiency but should be backed up by additional measurements at the affected structures and installations, in order to assess their exposure and risk of corrosion. Ideally, a stray current monitoring system proceeds from the measurement of these quantities, to data collection and archival, to data presentation, analysis and prediction. Feasible sensors and probes, the impact of environmental conditions and uncertainty are considered for the measurement at the physical level. Data analysis is critically reviewed considering the variability of operating conditions and the effectiveness of each quantity as indicator of track insulation and protection efficiency. Given the normal spread of values, for data presentation and interpretation, suitable techniques are considered based on averaging, curve similarity and feature extraction, and also for the task of assessing compliance to limits or reference values and establishing a trend that may drive informed maintenance decision.",

The available line voltage is reduced if the train is in traction condition, the arc itself is characterized by ohmic power losses, and the triggered oscillating transient responses are characterized by a net power loss. In addition, if arc occurs during braking the arc voltage suddenly increases the pantograph voltage and may interfere with the dissipative braking chopper, reducing the recovered energy. This work presents the model and analysis of these phenomena with experimental results for arcs measured on a 3 kV dc line in traction and braking conditions.",

The experimental data obtained from the lab set-up is analysed using Fast Fourier Transform and low frequency sinusoidal disturbance indices for input DC voltage and current are calculated. The results show that power quality of a DC/DC converter with varying loads does get affected by the conducted emissions, but the indices obtained cannot be quantified due to lack of standards for DC power quality. The indices decrease with increasing load and have a non-zero value at no-load condition. Further, the calculated results from amplitude probability distribution are in agreement with the indices as well.",

      "abstract": "DC railways are characterized by particularly intense arcing caused by pantograph detachment, due to the large current intensity and the general implementation of onboard resonant filters, whose transient response is triggered by electric transients including electric arcs. Electric arc depends on the train speed (the relative speed between the sliding contact over the pantograph and the hot spot on the catenary system), the intensity of the collected pantograph current and the line voltage level. Electric arcs are broadband in nature and can trigger the system transient response dominated by the resonant filter, besides interfering with the operation of onboard equipment (such as for energy conversion and metering).",

Similarly do the charging of onboard filter and other related inrush events.

The paper considers the relevance of the harmonic power terms in order to identify distortion sources in a single-point perspective, in line with the approach of EN 50463 for the quantification of the power and energy consumption. Some single-point Harmonic Producer Indicators (HPI) based on harmonic active power direction and nonactive distortion power terms are reviewed and evaluated using pantograph voltage and current measured during several hours of runs in two European AC railways (operated at 16.7 and 50 Hz). The HPI based on active power shows to be consistent and provides detailed information of rolling stock characteristic components under variable operating conditions; those based on nonactive distortion power are global indexes and hardly can operate with complex harmonic patterns in variable operating conditions.",

The results show the relevance of a reduced set of components and the strong correlation with train operating conditions. The relevance is significant for ac systems, and in particular 16.7 Hz systems.",

      "abstract": "The electrical arc occurring in the sliding contact between the supply contact line and the current collector (pantograph) of an electrical locomotive is a fast transient phenomenon able to degrade progressively the line-To-pantograph contact quality and, consequently, the continuity of operation. In order to increase the energy efficiency of the railway system, an inexpensive solution is constituted by the detection of the arc event by the analysis of voltage and current measurements already available on-board train. An essential activity to reach this objective is to set up a reliable electrical model of the railway system in which the arc events originate. To this end, this paper presents a combination of experimental and simulation analysis for the development of an electrical model of a direct current (dc) 3 kV railway system, which is aimed at better understanding the propagation of conducted effects generated by arc events. First, a laboratory experimental activity is carried out to investigate the electrical dynamic characteristics of the arc in a controlled environment. Then, a model of the dc railway system is derived and validated by using the experimental data collected in a measurement campaign on-board train. Finally, a sensitivity analysis of the main model parameters is carried out.",

      "abstract": "Power quality (PQ) phenomena characterizing the voltage and current signals of railway electricity networks differ from those present in transmission and distribution electricity grids. Presently, there are no standardized procedures focused on PQ measurement techniques explicitly for railway applications. This paper evaluates whether the standard power quality measurement algorithms used in monitoring 50 Hz electrical grids are sufficient for an accurate evaluation and classification of PQ parameters of voltage dips, swells and interruptions present in 25 kV AC railways. An algorithm is presented to better characterize different types of interruption, distinguishing between causes due to network configuration or by other factors. For voltage dips and swells it is also shown that a smaller window size (less than 1 cycle) produces a more accurate estimate of the disturbance magnitude and duration. The two methods are verified against recorded signals of pantograph voltage and current. Recommendations are therefore provided for PQ measurement algorithms for AC railways.",

A reliable tool for the arc event detection installed on each locomotive could allow a predictive maintenance of both contact line and locomotive pantograph, with a consequent improvement of the continuity of operation of the railway system. This paper represents the first step in the development of such a monitoring system. In detail, it provides a first electrical characterization of the sliding contact and, through an electrical model, it investigates the conductive effects on the overhead contact line.",

The design objective is to minimize the current leakage from the railway return path (the running rails for a dc-electrified railway, with possibly additional conductors in parallel for ac-electrified systems). For this objective to be met, the design needs to account for foreseeable misuse during the construction phase (i.e., the lack of independence between the earthing system and the stray current collection system, due to space and construction exigencies in a viaduct) and degradation of insulation due to ageing and poor maintenance. Perhaps, more importantly, other influences, such as the train characteristics, time tabling, headway, multiple train movement, etc., need consideration to determine the worst case leakage current and, thus, the ability to define appropriate mitigations with respect to stray current management. In this paper, we describe the implementation of an integrated model for the assessment of stray current for a dc-electrified railway, in which these factors are considered. We provide an analysis of the stray current magnitude under worst case train operating conditions (i.e., multiple trains with a 90-s headway accelerating) and highlight factors that determine the efficiency of the stray current collection system. The integrated model presented enables a detailed assessment of all factors impacting the stray current magnitude, as well as an assessment of the overall performance of the stray current collection system.",

      "abstract": "An accurate electric model of the earth is important for many applications related to electric traction and distribution systems like the stray current. As the DC electrified traction system is the potential source of the stray current, the operation of traction vehicles such as trains and trams makes the emergence of stray currents in the area of rails and under the rails. These leakage currents can adversely affect pipelines or cable lines near the rail [7][11]. There exist numerous models which have been modeled this phenomena [2][4][11], all models are based on one Dimensional earth structure, actually the nature of the earth underneath of the railways could not be represented as a homogeneous medium. The characteristics of the soil vary depending on the location and locally with depth, and a homogeneous earth model might be inadequate. [1] shows that even the multi-layered earth models are not reliable to be the base of the calculation of several applications related to the earth and grounding systems and it is required an accurate earth model which can give a better overview of whole structure of the underneath ground. In this work after a general presentation of the existing and proposed earth model, it is presented a comparison between the calculation of the stray current propagation based on one and 3-Dimensional earth model.",

      "abstract": "The propagation channel aboard trains is investigated with reference to the propagation path loss within cars, the delay spread and the coherence bandwidth. Results show that the path loss exponent is slightly smaller than in free space, possibly due to reflections by metal walls, and that it does not depend significantly on the position of transmitter and receiver. The delay spread and coherence bandwidth depend on both the polarization and distance between transmitter and receiver while the effect of interaction is not statistically significant. The best fit for both delay spread's and coherence bandwidth's experimental distribution is also investigated. Results show that it does not always match models suggested in the literature and that the fit changes with the values of the input parameters. Finally, the functional law between coherence bandwidth and delay spread is determined. Results typically match expectations although the specific measurement configuration effects the model parameters.",

      "abstract": "Validation of a simulation model is among other things the evaluation of accuracy against experimental data; quantitative judgment is based on performance indexes that measure various kinds of distances between simulation and data vectors: amplitude, slope, peaks, etc. Different indexes may privilege different characteristics always giving a somewhat biased judgment. For this reason three performance indexes that proved to be effective, robust and reliable are used on a complete test case, which allows verifying which system characteristics may have the most significant impact on validation results. The used performance indexes are Theil, Modified Pendry and FSV (the latter reported in the IEEE Std. 1597.2). The overall judgment of the simulator is “very good”, ranging between good” and “excellent” for various positions and configurations, with the three indexes in substantial agreement, and some minor differences.",

One of the most effective methods of reducing energy consumption in a rail transit system is optimizing the speed profile of the trains along the route. A genetic algorithm (GA) based approach is proposed to search for the optimal train speed trajectory, given a journey time constraint, and its effectiveness is shown by simulation results. The proposed approach includes realistic system modeling using an integrated electromechanical simulation model to calculate train energy consumption and travelling time under different operating conditions, inter-station distances, track profiles.",

      "abstract": "When evaluating track circuits (TCs) interference, the latest normative approach indicates the use of band-pass filters that emulate the TC receiver response. The rms value of the output, when compared to the interference limit, indicates whether a specific signal might create interference or not. The implementation of the filter has some degrees of freedom and needs thus to be characterized in terms of added uncertainty to the interference evaluation process. The latter is relevant to safety, strictly related to the incorrect assignment of the status of the track section monitored and protected by the TC itself. When giving a definitive answer about the immunity of a specific TC and the compatibility with the tested rolling stock, it is thus necessary to completely evaluate the uncertainty associated to the chosen model and to the related signal processing operations, even if - it is recognized - their influence may be considered of second order with respect to infrastructure and rolling stock non-idealities.",

      "abstract": "The Global System for Mobile communications-Railways (GSM-R) is being deployed in different countries to develop an efficient communication-based train control (CBTC) system. GSM-R participates to achieve railways interoperability, replacing noninteroperable CBTC on existing networks and, thus, facilitating cross-border train circulations. GSM-R ensures voice and data transmissions between trains and control centers and also between trains. As any radio equipment, it is subject to electromagnetic (EM) disturbances present in the railway environment. Therefore, the quality of GSM-R transmissions can deteriorate. It is then important to evaluate and predict the effect of these disturbances in order to avoid any loss of train operational capacity. After an overview of the methods used for the characterization of the EM environment, we describe the GSM-R and the EM disturbances that can affect its operation. The reasons why the existing characterization methods are not fully adapted to the GSM-R are highlighted. The general principle of classification is briefly recalled. The rest of this paper develops the methodology proposed to perform the classification of transient EM noises and the presentation of a test bench and its associated experimental results. Finally, an application to an add-on electromagnetic compatibility supervising equipment installed on board the train is described. © 2013 IEEE.",

The stray current intensity depends on several factors (such as traction current, rail insulation, concrete mat and pier resistance) that need to be accounted for in any model for the estimation of stray current. The effect of an uniform or multilayer soil in such predictive model is of equal importance. In practice, there are numerous models that have been developed to investigate railway stray current phenomena; these models can be categorized into two - namely distributed parameter model and lump parameter model - based on the parameter model used.

      "abstract": "The GSM-R (Global System for Mobile communications-Railways) is a communication system under deployment in Europe to transmit voice exchanges and data signalling information between the trains and the control centres. This system consists in a network of Base Transceiver Stations (BTS) located on the track side and the trains are equipped with an antenna on the locomotive connected to an embedded mobile. The GSM-R antenna receives the signals sent by the BTS but can also receive in-band electromagnetic (EM) interferences present above the train. These interferences have therefore to be controlled to verify that their levels do not affect the quality of the GSM-R reception. This paper is focused on the research of observables and measurement methods efficient to control the EM disturbances produced on board the trains, in order to warrant the protection of the GSM-R communications. © 2012 IEEE.",

The Power Quality phenomena affecting traction voltage are many, steady and transient, depending on the converter operations at substations and on-board vehicles. A classification is proposed and a discussion follows of the correct methods for their quantification, with reference to related standards and to the vast background related to ac networks. The characterization of PQ is related on one side to ripple and fluctuation of the pantograph variables for supply purposes, and on the other side to the appearance of specific components relevant for interference to signaling on the track. Considerations and conclusions are based on a large amount of measured waveforms, recorded on the Italian railway networks, and are aimed at contributing to the forthcoming standards on traction supply quality.",

      "abstract": "The increasing implementation of Light Rail Transit System (LRTS) as an integrated form of public transportation, with the rail corridor running through city centers and connecting major commercial centers, presents a unique electromagnetic coupling scenario between sensitive installations and the dc magnetic field propagated from the LRTS. It is not surprising therefore, that there has been increasing interest in the prediction and mitigation of the magnetic fields propagated from such light rails. Numerous measurements have been performed, such as those by Lowes [1], Hsaio and Lin [2] and Yamazaki [3, 4] with the view of quantifying the magnetic field from dc railways, however differences in Light Rail Vehicles restrict the use of measurement data across differing LRTS. Measurement data however has contributed to the development of numerical and computational analysis as applied to dc electrified railway. Waki et al. [5] investigated the use of magnetic shields, installed along the alignment, to attenuate the magnetic field propagated by the railway; this solution is feasible where the railway does not share the right of way with an existing road network. Schepper and Rabl [6], analysed a Compensation Conductor (CC) arrangement using a resistance network approach and reported a 42% improvement in the magnetic field due to the CC. Mariscotti and Ogunsola in [7] investigated the effectiveness of a mitigating technique based on the installation of CCs that can either be installed to be at the same potential of either the Overhead Contact Wire (OCW) or Running Rail (RR); the authors were able to demonstrate a 10 dB attenuation of the propagating magnetic field. In this paper, the work of Mariscotti and Ogunsola is furthered by optimising the CCs arrangement with a view of maximising the attenuation of the propagated magnetic field. The approach to optimization is based on the minimization of either the mutual impedance term in the loop impedance expression or the weighted sum of magnetic field intensity in selected points. Computational results of the induction field computation is reported by means of contour curves, showing the achieved attenuation of the propagated magnetic field.",

This electromagnetic environment is rather new and is characterized by abundance of reflecting and diffracting elements, so that a significant difference with respect to more common residential and office environments was found. The measurement setup is simple and easy to position and operate; the measurement results were validated by comparison with another independent measurement setup. The results indicate that the power losses for corridors are not a power law of distance, due to scattering; even in large environments such as restaurant halls the presence of reflecting and scattering objects and installations largely affects the received power. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

      "abstract": "In modern electric traction systems, the calculation of induced voltage on internal and external conductors is always required for both interference and people and equipment safety. The International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee (CCITT) method is based on simplified relationships, which are integrated by suitable screening factors (representing and hiding the traction system complexity). Focus is on the determination of these factors and the accuracy, which are evaluated with simulation and experimental data. The considered systems are rail return, return conductor, and autotransformer (AT) 2 × 25-kV traction systems with victim cables of various lengths; the influence of the most relevant electric parameters (soil resistivity and conductance to earth of the return circuit conductors) is considered. The results confirm the relevance of the conductance to earth and of the position of the current injection point. The induced voltage is approximately proportional to the length, with a slight increase for shorter victim cables. The calculated AT screening factor is always smaller than the values suggested by the standards by a factor of 2 in the worst case. For the influence of separation of the inducing and victim circuits, the adopted methods agree in finding a critical distance around 68 m; at larger distances, CCITT values are slightly optimistic. Measured results confirm that the CCITT coefficients are all conservative by a factor of 24 (except the AT coefficient for total length exposure), whereas the multiconductor transmission line (MTL) results agree with a worst-case margin of 13%. © 2010 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The problem of electrical parameters identification in complex systems, and in particular in electric railway traction systems, is considered. Parameters are determined by an indirect approach: only the terminal variables (voltages and currents and, impedance and admittance, which can be readily calculated) are measured and the per-unit-length electrical parameters are determined using a multiconductor transmission line model of the track section under test. It will be shown that some parameters cannot be measured directly, that they are not constant with frequency and that they may depend on other external conditions. An indirect method for parameters identification is proposed through an adaptive algorithm (AA), so that the calculated terminal variables match the measured ones. The AA is based on a genetic algorithm (GA) approach, with details on pattern generation (through mutation and recombination) and determination of the degree of fitness and, as a consequence, of matching and stop criteria. There is a general accordance with model previsions, within common variations of the most critical properties of the test track. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The data recorded during two measurement campaigns are used to prove the analysis methods and to better describe the measurement procedures. The following important factors are considered: 1) the reactive behavior of the field, site attenuation, and antenna factor determination; 2) the physical dimensions of the source of the emissions and its impact on the correction factor uncertainty; 3) the EM environment; and 4) the ambient EM noise.

The conductors' arrangement is that of the new European High Speed Railway Line (HSRL) under construction: The overhead supply conductors in contact with the train pantograph are connected to a symmetrical circuit (the feeder) with the purpose of current balancing; the traction return current flows from the rolling stock axles back to the supply (i.e., substation) through the traction rails and additional return conductors. The test campaign carried on the Rome-Naples HSRL allowed the validation of the multiconductor transmission line model used for system analysis.

      "abstract": "The industrial prototype of a superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES), sized to deliver 1 MW for 1 s, was designed and constructed as the result of a research project, partly funded by the Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research. After successfully undergoing factory tests, the SMES was installed at the Elettra Synchrotron Light facility in Trieste-I and is there under commissioning and testing as protecting device from temporary voltage dips and interruptions, the most frequent grid malfunctions causing faults of the beam magnetic confinement system. The innovative part of the prototype, which also includes several sophisticated power electronics items, is a 2.6 MJ stored energy magnet, wound with a new low-losses Nb Ti cable, cooled by liquid helium at 4.2 K and adopting an electric insulation design solution to withstand 8 kV and obtain very close contact between coolant and coil. New design hybrid current leads, made of a resistive copper stage and a high temperature super-conducting one, cooperate together with a set of three cryocoolers and a multi-shield cryostat to keep the helium loss amount negligible. Electrical insulation of the most critical components and the quench detection system is extremely accurate, because the voltage at coil-ends rises up to 2.500 V. The experimental results obtained at Elettra during the beginning of the SMES commissioning phase are presented. © 2006 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The problem of determination of the accurate distribution of the return current in AT (autotransformer) electric traction systems (supplied at 2 × 25 kV) for High Speed Railways is considered. The path of the traction return current flowing from the rolling stock axles back to the supply (i.e., substation) is composed of the traction rails and additional earth potential conductors. The overhead supply conductors in contact with the train pantograph are connected to a symmetrical circuit (the feeder) with the purpose of current balancing. This arrangement and its influence on current to earth are considered: the return current divides among rails (as signalling disturbing current) and earth, depending on the value of the electric parameters of the system and the earth and on the circuit arrangement and on the relative position of system devices. The amplitude (as a percentage of the total return current) of the disturbing current may be high enough to cause interference to signalling. This work investigates the behavior of the return current in AT electric railway systems, on the basis of a reference system for the variation of the most important electrical parameters. © 2005 IEEE.",

The subject is important not only for estimation of the disturbance produced by new rolling stock in plausible traffic conditions, but also for each railway operator to fix adequate limits for the return current of each unit. The analysis is performed on a reference ac single track line of overall 50-km length. First, the sources of interference are classified, with particular attention to the synchronization issue and phase displacement. Then, the railway line properties as the mean of conductive coupling are identified (attenuation and phase rotation versus frequency and length). Last, a preliminary attempt is made to derive summation rules for disturbance from different vehicles. © 2004 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "This paper deals with the assessment of low-frequency magnetic-field emissions (MFE) in the engine-driver cab and the passengers' compartments of rolling stock. For emissions' measurement, an experimental setup is designed, involving a three-axial magnetic-field sensor mounted on an antenna positioner, and optically linked to the data-handling system. Measurement is accomplished in the time domain and allows one to retrieve digitized time scries of the spatial components of the magnetic-flux density (MFD) vector, at specific points in the measurement volume. Worst case emissions are related to the train operating modes by referring to an experiment that includes acceleration from an initial stop, inertial motion, and braking up to a new stop. The nonstationary behavior of the most relevant MFD sinusoidal components is evidenced, and it is accounted in the spectral analysis by resorting to short-time Fourier transform bused on a fixed-length time windows of proper duration. For safety assessment, a compliance check of MFE levels with exposure limits is proposed, based on the computation of an instantaneous safety parameter, obtained by extending requirements developed in the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection guidelines for the simpler case of multiple-frequency steady-state fields.",

The results consist of H-field values measured at the two substations, inside the buildings (near the rectifier groups) and outside (in the area surrounding the high-voltage input line, the HV/MV transformers, and the rectifier transformers) for different load conditions during normal service. The goal of this work is to determine the H-field intensity at low and medium frequency at dc railway substations. The measurement results are post-processed to extract statistical properties (namely, average values, dispersion, and distribution histograms).

      "abstract": "The problem of the determination of the real distribution of the return current in electric railway traction systems is considered. One or more conductors (depending on the specific supply system) are purposely set up to carry the traction return current flowing from the rolling stock axles back to the supply (i.e., substation); yet, part of the return current flows through signalling conductors (disturbing current) and through the earth, depending on the value of the electric parameters of the system, on the circuit arrangement, and on the relative position of the supply, the rolling stock, and signalling devices. The amplitude (as a percentage of the total return current) of the disturbing current may be high enough to cause interference to signalling. This work investigates the behavior of the return current in ac and dc electric railway systems, on the basis of a reference system for the variation of the most important electrical parameters. The definition of the transfer function between the return current and the signalling circuit variables is an important element for the compatibility analysis between train detection systems, rolling stock and infrastructure, to promote the cross-acceptance of rolling stock in Europe and abroad.",

The computation is developed using the switching functions approach, relating the output voltage waveform to the absorbed dc-link current; so, the method may be applied also to measured waveforms, when no analytical expression is available. The method is extended also to the general case of non sinusoidal load currents. The spectrum of the dc-link current for several inverter modulations (deterministic and random modulations) is calculated and considerations on the harmonic distortion and dc-link filter requirements are presented.",

The algorithm is very convenient in terms of memory storage and computational requirements and may be implemented on low cost platforms. The results show that the time for detection is very short and always less than a quarter of the supply voltage period.",

Attention is focused onto two problems: the power quality (low frequency conducted harmonics and resonance issues) of the AC supply interface and the DC distribution interface.

      "abstract": "Measurements of the harmonic spectra of the AC side currents were performed on a urban metrorail supply system (MetroGenova). The supply system is composed of two Electric Supply Substations (ESSs), each equipped with two+one twelve-puke reaction diode rectifiers, located 2 km apart; they are supplied by medium voltage network (IS kV, SO Hz) and the dc traction voltage is 750 V. The Point of Common Coupling (PCC) is shared with other distorting loads of smaller power rating. The measuring system is composed of current (CTs and hall effect probes) and voltage (VTs) transducers, conditioning and interface system and PC hosted acquisition board. Two line currents and one line-to-line voltage have been measured at the PCC and at ESS input connection for different operating conditions: Only one ESS and two ESSs feeding the traction line. The measurement records span over several working days, from 6 am to 9 pm. The transit system headway is S min. during rush hours and 10-15 min. for the rest of the day. The presence of long interval of times with no running vehicles (no traction load) produces a lot of small amplitude readings. In this work a posteriori analysis is performed to increase the significance of the measured data and the accuracy of the statistical indexes (mean and standard deviation of the amplitude and phase of fundamental and harmonic components).",
