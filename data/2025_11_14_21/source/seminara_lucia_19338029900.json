      "abstract": "This agenda-setting workshop will bring together HCI researchers and designers with colleagues from sociology, media, and communications to generate an interdisciplinary research agenda for digital communication beyond human-centric replication. It argues that the dominance of a human-centric replication paradigm in digital communication is problematic, constraining, limits digital innovation, and continues to unquestionably place humans at the center of digital futures with negative social implications for modes of digital communication and how we relate to one another. This workshop will explore and foster alternative visions of digital communication, drawing inspiration from animal and plant sensory worlds (through inspirational talks, hands-on-activities, discussion) to generate ideas towards a new way of thinking and working in sensorial immersion beyond the human-centric. We will address key research opportunities and challenges and build the foundations for a road-map for this novel area of research.",

      "abstract": "Artificial tactile sensing systems have received significant attention in recent years due to their potential to improve human-machine interaction. Extracting contact forces is relevant for haptic perception and to support control actions. However, static force reconstruction is still a challenge for distributed sensing systems where sensors have a large bandwidth and do not measure static information. In this paper, we propose a machine learning based method for estimating the peak normal force in an indentation action on a tactile sensing system based on P(VDFTrFE) poly(vinylidene fluoride trifluoroethylene) piezoelectric polymers. A set of statistical time features is extracted from the raw signal acquired during the indentation process. These features are then used to train and evaluate an artificial neural network. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for force reconstruction, achieving a correlation coefficient R of 0.92247 and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 16.41%.",

In this work, we present an innovative exploration strategy to simultaneously detect symmetries in a 3-D object and use this information to enhance shape estimation. This is achieved by leveraging a novel formulation of Gaussian process models that allows the modeling of symmetric surfaces. Our procedure does not assume any prior knowledge about the object, neither about its shape nor about the presence and type of symmetry, necessitating only an approximate estimate of the size and boundaries (bounding box). We report experimental results both in simulation and in the real world, showing that using symmetric models leads to a reduction in shape estimation error, exploration time, and in the number of physical contacts performed by a robot when exploring objects that have symmetries.",

      "abstract": "The primary objective of this research is to develop a model-based framework for the indentation on the surface of a soft electronic skin. In the current paper, the model has been applied to a soft electronic skin embedding piezoelectric polymer (PVDF, polyvinylidene fluoride) transducers. We revisit in a dimensionless fashion an analytical solution of the problem presented in a previous contribution for a normal force (frictionless case) and extend the analysis to account for a tangential component of the contact force (frictional case). First, the transmission of Hertzian distributed forces through the skin elastomer layer to a PVDF transducer is analyzed, assuming a half-space model for the elastomer. Then, the above mathematical formulation has been employed to perform extensive FEM simulations such to extend the analytical solutions for the half-space case to the real configuration where the elastomer layer has finite thickness and the transducer is not necessarily vertically aligned with the indenter. The model is applied to the case of a dragon skin, a well-known soft alternative to the silicone-based PDMS e-skin discussed in the previous paper. The model can be easily extended to other sensor types, provided the transducer is integrated on a rigid substrate and converts the pressure acting on its upper surface into a proportional electrical signal. The present framework is a first step towards the construction of a general design tool for soft electronic skins based on pressure transducers, regardless of the specific transducer type and material employed for the soft cover.",

      "abstract": "Robotic grippers aim to be increasingly precise, being effective in object manipulation and gentle on fragile objects. In this scenario, endowing a gripper with a distributed sensing system sensitive to a set of dynamic touch patterns seems crucial to improve the gripper as a manipulation device. In humans, the velocity of touch influences haptic perception with impact on object manipulation and exploration. Therefore, the current study has also potential to drive sensory feedback for intuitive human-in-the-loop control of haptic devices. In this study, we embed an electronic skin (e-skin) into the thumb fingertip of a robotic gripper to investigate tactile sensor response during an easy task of object grasp-release, thus focusing on normal forces only. The reference electronic skin is a tactile sensing system based on piezoelectric polymers, coupled to a rigid substrate and covered by an elastomer layer. The cover layer has been chosen because it is easily disposable and for its 'human skin'-like softness characteristics. Main scope is to investigate whether piezoelectric sensors are sensitive to the grasping speed. The parameter we set is the speed of the servomotors for the proximal and distal flexion of the fingers. Increasing the speed of the servomotors results in an increase of the speed of the phalanges, i.e. the grasping speed. Two objects of different stiffness have been tested and three different features of the sensor signal have been analyzed. These preliminary results show an increasing linear behavior of the amplitudes of the maximum and minimum peaks in the sensor signal with the servomotor speed. The size of the processing window seems not to impact the relation between the signal energy and the speed, thus suggesting that the smallest window could be effectively used to extract such feature in embedded devices in real-time. These pilot studies are hints at the fact that coupling information from such features could enable inferring the grasping force and speed.",

      "abstract": "Most objects are symmetric. In fact, humans are very good at detecting symmetry, both by vision and by touch, and they use such information to facilitate the perception of other object properties, such as shape and size; overall, this contributes to human's ability to successfully manipulate objects in unstructured environments. Inspired by this human skill, in this paper we propose a haptic exploration procedure that enables a robot to detect object symmetry, and uses such information to estimate the shape of an object with higher accuracy and in less time. We achieve this by incorporating symmetries in a Gaussian Process model, and by introducing a novel strategy to detect the presence of such symmetry. We report results obtained with a Baxter robot equipped with a custom tactile sensor on the gripper: we show that when the robot explores objects with unknown symmetries the time required to estimate the object shape is reduced by up to 50% thanks to our method.",

      "abstract": "The shapes of most real-world objects are symmetric with respect to at least one plane of symmetry. This information is unconsciously used by humans when they attempt to estimate the shape of an object in presence of uncertainty or missing evidence, for example if the object is partially occluded or if they are exploring the object by touch (i.e. haptic exploration). In robotics, this concept has been used for the visual estimation of object shape. However, no attempt has been made so far to incorporate this idea into haptic-based estimation. This work presents a method for the haptic exploration of object shape that includes the assumption that a symmetry could exist. The approach combines a tailored version of Gaussian Processes and a novel exploratory procedure that is able to detect the position and orientation of any plane of symmetry. Our results show that, if one or more symmetries exist, the object shape can be estimated faster and more accurately. Interestingly, in the case that no symmetry is present, the exploration process is only slightly slower, and the final accuracy of the shape estimation is not compromised.",

The available tactile feedback interfaces comprise few sensing and stimulation units, which limits the amount of information conveyed to the user. The present study describes a novel technology that relies on distributed sensing and stimulation to convey comprehensive tactile feedback to the user of a robotic end effector. The system comprises six flexible sensing arrays (57 sensors) integrated on the fingers and palm of a robotic hand, embedded electronics (64 recording channels), a multichannel stimulator and seven flexible electrodes (64 stimulation pads) placed on the volar side of the subject s hand. The system was tested in seven subjects asked to recognize contact positions and identify contact sliding on the electronic skin, using distributed anode configuration (DAC) and single dedicated anode configuration. The experiments demonstrated that DAC resulted in substantially better performance. Using DAC, the system successfully translated the contact patterns into electrotactile profiles that the subjects could recognize with satisfactory accuracy (i.e. median{IQR} of 88.6{11}% for static and 93.3{5}% for dynamic patterns).

      "abstract": "Modern prosthetic arms and hands are sophisticated robotic devices that can provide some of the motor functions lost due to an amputation. However, none of the commonly used commercial systems restores somatosensory feedback to its user. In principle, the latter can be achieved by recording data from prosthesis sensors and conveying this information by stimulating the sensory structures of the amputee using invasive and noninvasive interfaces. Many such systems have been presented in the literature with promising results; however, they all rely on using only a few discrete stimulation points to transmit information and hence suffer from a limited information bandwidth. In this chapter, we propose a novel concept of a high-bandwidth feedback interface that relies on advanced sensing and stimulation to convey a large amount of information to the prosthesis user. The interface comprises an artificial skin covering the prosthesis with a dense network of tactile sensors (taxels) and a compact stimulation device delivering electrical current pulses through a matrix electrode with many conductive pads. The state-ofthe- art in the two technologies that are required for the implementation of the proposed concept are reviewed. This includes biomimetic e-skins that are suitable for the application in a wearable scenario, stimulation systems integrating a demultiplexing circuit to distribute electrical pulses, and flexible electrodes that can be produced with arbitrary shape, size, and distribution of conductive pads. Finally, the challenges in selecting feedback variables (raw signals versus high-level features) and mapping of these variables into stimulation parameters are addressed.",

      "abstract": "Stroke patients suffer from impairments of both motor and somatosensory functions. The functional recovery of upper extremities is one of the primary goals of rehabilitation programs. Additional somatosensory deficits limit sensorimotor function and significantly affect its recovery after the neuromotor injury. Sensory substitution systems, providing tactile feedback, might facilitate manipulation capability, and improve patient's dexterity during grasping movements. As a first step toward this aim, we evaluated the ability of healthy subjects in exploiting electrotactile feedback on the shoulder to determine the number of perceived stimuli in numerosity judgment tasks. During the experiment, we compared four different stimulation patterns (two simultaneous: short and long, intermittent and sequential) differing in total duration, total energy, or temporal synchrony. The experiment confirmed that the subject ability to enumerate electrotactile stimuli decreased with increasing the number of active electrodes. Furthermore, we found that, in electrotactile stimulation, the temporal coding schemes, and not total energy or duration modulated the accuracy in numerosity judgment. More precisely, the sequential condition resulted in significantly better numerosity discrimination than intermittent and simultaneous stimulation. These findings, together with the fact that the shoulder appeared to be a feasible stimulation site to communicate tactile information via electrotactile feedback, can serve as a guide to deliver tactile feedback to proximal areas in stroke survivors who lack sensory integrity in distal areas of their affected arm, but retain motor skills.",

      "abstract": "Among most challenging open issues in prosthetic research is the development of a robust bidirectional interface between a prosthesis and its user. Commercially available prosthetic systems are mechanically advanced, but they do not provide somatosensory feedback. Here, we present a novel non-invasive interface for multichannel electrotactile feedback, comprising a matrix of 24 pads, and we investigate the ability of able-bodied human subjects to localize the electrotactile stimulus delivered through the matrix. For this purpose, we tested conventional stimulation (same frequency for all pads) and a novel dual-parameter modulation scheme (interleaved frequency and intensity) designed to facilitate the spatial localization over the electrode. Electrotactile stimulation was also compared to mechanical stimulation of the same locations on the skin. Experimental results on eight able-bodied subjects demonstrated that the proposed interleaved coding substantially improved the spatial localization compared to same-frequency stimulation. The results also showed that same-frequency stimulation was equivalent to mechanical stimulation, whereas the performance with dual-parameter modulation was significantly better. These are encouraging outcomes for the application of a multichannel interface for the restoration of feedback in prosthetics. The high-resolution augmented interfaces might be used to explore novel scenarios for effective communication with the prosthesis user enabled by maximizing information transmission.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes a validation method of the fabrication technology of a screen‐printed electronic skin based on polyvinylidene fluoride‐trifluoroethylene P(VDF‐TrFE) piezoelectric polymer sensors. This required researchers to insure, through non‐direct sensor characterization, that printed sensors were working as expected. For that, we adapted an existing model to non-destructively extract sensor behavior in pure compression (i.e., the d33 piezocoefficient) by indentation tests over the skin surface. Different skin patches, designed to sensorize a glove and a prosthetic hand (11 skin patches, 104 sensors), have been tested. Reproducibility of the sensor response and its dependence upon sensor position on the fabrication substrate were examined, highlighting the drawbacks of employing large A3‐sized substrates. The average value of d33 for all sensors was measured at incremental preloads (1–3 N). A systematic decrease has been checked for patches located at positions not affected by substrate shrinkage. In turn, sensor reproducibility and d33 adherence to literature values validated the e‐skin fabrication technology. To extend the predictable behavior to all skin patches and thus increase the number of working sensors, the size of the fabrication substrate is to be decreased in future skin fabrication. The tests also demonstrated the efficiency of the proposed method to characterize embedded sensors which are no more accessible for direct validation.",

      "abstract": "In the past few years a new scenario for robot-based applications has emerged. Service and mobile robots have opened new market niches. Also, new frameworks for shop-floor robot applications have been developed. In all these contexts, robots are requested to perform tasks within open-ended conditions, possibly dynamically varying. These new requirements ask also for a change of paradigm in the design of robots: on-line and safe feedback motion control becomes the core of modern robot systems. Future robots will learn autonomously, interact safely and possess qualities like self-maintenance. Attaining these features would have been relatively easy if a complete model of the environment was available, and if the robot actuators could execute motion commands perfectly relative to this model. Unfortunately, a complete world model is not available and robots have to plan and execute the tasks in the presence of environmental uncertainties which makes sensing an important component of new generation robots. For this reason, today’s new generation robots are equipped with more and more sensing components, and consequently they are ready to actively deal with the high complexity of the real world. Complex sensorimotor tasks such as exploration require coordination between the motor system and the sensory feedback. For robot control purposes, sensory feedback should be adequately organized in terms of relevant features and the associated data representation. In this paper, we propose an overall functional picture linking sensing to action in closed-loop sensorimotor control of robots for touch (hands, fingers). Basic qualities of haptic perception in humans inspire the models and categories comprising the proposed classification. The objective is to provide a reasoned, principled perspective on the connections between different taxonomies used in the Robotics and human haptic literature. The specific case of active exploration is chosen to ground interesting use cases. Two reasons motivate this choice. First, in the literature on haptics, exploration has been treated only to a limited extent compared to grasping and manipulation. Second, exploration involves specific robot behaviors that exploit distributed and heterogeneous sensory data.",

To this aim, the prosthesis can be supplied with sensory arrays to measure the tactile interaction with the environment. In addition, a reliable feedback system is required to code and transmit the measured somatosensory information to the residual limb. This paper presents a multichannel electrotactile stimulation interface. Two coding schemes (mixed and uniform coding) were tested to assess the ability of the subject to localize the stimulation (identify the active pad). The outcome measures were position recognition and frequency discrimination. Our preliminary results show high accuracies in discriminating different frequency levels, i.e., 80% for low-level frequencies and 87% for high-level frequencies. In addition, the mixed coding has substantially improved the spatial localization. These are important insights regarding the development of multichannel sensing and stimulation systems for feedback in prosthetics.",

      "abstract": "Computation accuracy can be adequately tuned on the specific application requirements in order to reduce power consumption. To give some examples, image processing and audio/speech recognition e.g., multimedia applications may provide more accurate outputs than human capabilities can appreciate. In this case, producing inexact numerical outputs can be acceptable and approximate computing circuits could be employed to reduce power consumption by decreasing the hardware complexity. This paper proposes approximate multipliers based on exact and inexact adder circuits and their FPGA implementation: the proposed multipliers can be applied for both signed and unsigned operations. Two scenarios were considered and analyzed in this paper. First, the performance of the proposed multiplier based on inexact adder is evaluated by comparing the power consumption, the accuracy of computation, and the time delay with those of an approximate multiplier based on exact adder. Second, the design parameters of the proposed multipliers are compared with those of the Baugh-Wooley multiplier. On the other hand, we analyzed and compared the performance of the unsigned approximate multipliers with respect to the signed approximate ones. Results prove that the proposed approximate multipliers achieve a reduction in power consumption of 56.3% with respect to the Baugh-Wooley multiplier at cost of less than 5% of accuracy loss.",

      "abstract": "The reference electronic skin is a sensor array based on PVDF (Polyvinylidene fluoride) piezoelectric polymers, coupled to a rigid substrate and covered by an elastomer layer. It is first evaluated how a distributed normal force (Hertzian distribution) is transmitted to an extended PVDF sensor through the elastomer layer. A simplified approach based on Boussinesq’s half-space assumption is used to get a qualitative picture and extensive FEM simulations allow determination of the quantitative response for the actual finite elastomer layer. The ultimate use of the present model is to estimate the electrical sensor output from a measure of a basic mechanical action at the skin surface. However this requires that the PVDF piezoelectric coefficient be known a-priori. This was not the case in the present investigation. However, the numerical model has been used to fit experimental data from a real skin prototype and to estimate the sensor piezoelectric coefficient. It turned out that this value depends on the preload and decreases as a result of PVDF aging and fatigue. This framework contains all the fundamental ingredients of a fully predictive model, suggesting a number of future developments potentially useful for skin design and validation of the fabrication technology.",

      "abstract": "Modern prostheses aim at restoring the functional and aesthetic characteristics of the lost limb. To foster prosthesis embodiment and functionality, it is necessary to re-establish both volitional control and sensory feedback. Contemporary feedback interfaces presented in research use few sensors and stimulation units to feedback at most two discrete feedback variables (e.g., grasping force and aperture), whereas the human sense of touch relies on a distributed network of mechanoreceptors providing high-fidelity spatial information. To provide this type of feedback in prosthetics, it is necessary to sense tactile information from artificial skin placed on the prosthesis and transmit tactile feedback above the amputation in order to map the interaction between the prosthesis and the environment.

Non-invasive cutaneous electrostimulation transmits the tactile information sensed by the electronic skin on the prosthetic hand to the human brain, through the amputee's afferent nervous system. In this paper, our current benchtop prototype of a distributed sensing-stimulation system is presented, together with the envisaged high-fidelity solution which will be integrated into a real prosthetic hand.",

      "abstract": "Myoelectric prostheses are successfully controlled using muscle electrical activity, thereby restoring lost motor functions. However, the somatosensory feedback from the prosthesis to the user is still missing. The sensory substitution methods described in the literature comprise mostly simple position and force sensors combined with discrete stimulation units. The present study describes a novel system for sophisticated electrotactile feedback integrating advanced distributed sensing (electronic skin) and stimulation (matrix electrodes). The system was tested in eight healthy subjects who were asked to recognize the shape, trajectory, and direction of a set of dynamic movement patterns (single lines, geometrical objects, letters) presented on the electronic skin. The experiments demonstrated that the system successfully translated the mechanical interaction into the moving electrotactile profiles, which the subjects could recognize with a good performance (shape recognition: 86±8 lines, 73±13% geometries, 72±12% letters). In particular, the subjects could identify the movement direction with a high confidence. These results are in accordance with previous studies investigating the recognition of moving stimuli in human subjects. This is an important development towards closed-loop prostheses providing comprehensive and sophisticated tactile feedback to the user, facilitating the control and the embodiment of the artificial device into the user body scheme.",

      "abstract": "Due to its very peculiar features, the development of e-skin can be effectively tackled using a holistic approach. Starting from the definition of system specifications, the mechanical arrangement of the skin itself needs to be designed and fabricated together with the electronic embedded system, to move towards aspects such as tactile data processing algorithms and the communication channel interface. In this paper we present the design, the implementation and the results on the way of the development of an electronic skin (e-skin) system based on arrays of piezopolymer transducers. Focus of the paper is on both the development of innovative approaches for tactile information processing and electronic system embedding into the e-skin structure. In particular, Machine Learning technologies can provide a powerful tool to tackle the pattern-recognition problems involved in the tactile sensing framework and the ability of processing data represented as N-th order tensor is the key aspect of the presented research, which can be seen as an application of an existing method (Signoretto et al., 2011). The experimental session compares two different implementations of the ML-based framework, which differ in the learning paradigm adopted, namely SVM and ELM (K-ELM). The effectiveness of the adopted pattern-recognition technologies in the classification of touch modalities has been confirmed by addressing two different binary classification problems in an experiment involving 70 participants. The computational requirements for the hardware implementation of the proposed algorithm together with an overview of what exists in the existing literature are finally discussed.",

      "abstract": "This research is motivated by the need of integrating cutaneous sensing into a prosthetic device, enabling a bidirectional communication between the amputee and the prosthetic limb. An electronic skin based on piezoelectric polymer sensors transduces mechanical contact into electrical response which is conveyed to the human subject by electrotactile stimulation. Rectangular electrode arrays are placed on each patient's forearm and experiments are conducted on five different subjects to determine how well the orientation, position and direction of single lines are recognized. Overall, subjects discriminate the different touch modalities with acceptable success rates. In particular, the direction is identified at best and longitudinal lines on the patient's skin are recognized with the highest success rates. These preliminary results assess the feasibility of the artificial skin - electrostimulation system for prosthetic applications.",

      "abstract": "The main task of robotic skin is recognition of tactile stimuli acting on the surface of a soft elastic layer through the outputs of embedded sensor arrays. The focus of this work is the development of an algorithm for estimating the spatial distribution of contact forces as well as their intensities and directions starting from sensor data. This requires the solution of an inverse problem where only incomplete information (e.g. normal stress on the sensors) is usually available. The proposed method discretizes external forces at the nodes of a grid. The more practical solution is fixing the node number equal to the number of sensors. In this case, the inverse problem of retrieving the force distribution from sensor data is trivially solved if normal forces are applied. For multi-component force distributions, on the other hand, the problem is in principle ill-posed. A solution is achieved through an optimization procedure accounting for the physical features of the problem by the use of the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse matrix and of a vector depending on two continuous and adjustable scalar parameters. The algorithm has been tested on simulated single-contact problems (both Hertzian and non-Hertzian normal force distributions) with encouraging results for both accuracy and robustness of the solution.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach for realizing tactile sensors by integrating a piezoelectric polymer with a low voltage Organic Thin-Film Transistor (OTFT) on flexible plastic substrates. The transducing element consists of PVDF piezoelectric film. The proposed device architecture is similar to the extended gate scheme, whereby the transducing material is connected to OTFT via extended gate. In this scheme, the OTFTs and the transducer material may be or same substrate, as in this case, or they may be on different substrates. The piezoelectric effect induced by an external mechanical stimulus modulates the output current of the OTFT. This scheme represents a simple and innovative solution for artificial sense of touch and is particularly suitable for the low-cost fabrication of so-called \"electronic skin\". The electromechanical characterization shows that the sensing devices can detect forces stimuli within the range 0.5-8N.",

      "abstract": "Artificial skin systems support human-robot interactions through touch. The interpretation of touch modalities indeed represents a crucial component for the future development of robots that can properly interact with humans. Independently of the specific employed transducer, one of the key issues is how to process the massively complex and high-dimensional tactile data. In this paper, machine learning technologies (namely, support vector machines and extreme learning machines) support a pattern-recognition framework that can fully exploit the tensor morphology of the tactile signal. Furthermore, a practical strategy is provided to address the intricacies of the training procedure. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2001-2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Gas sensor arrays based on metal oxides operating at high temperature are commonly used in many application fields. They can operate on different principles and each sensor may show very different responses to the individual gases in the environment. Data coming from the array can be merged for reliable gas detection. One point which is common to the different sensors types is that the atmosphere to be sensed must flow on or through the sensor itself. This work investigates air flows in gas sensor packages, and proposes a new package to improve gas exchange through natural convection, aiming to allow the gas detection in the case of very small gas concentrations. The study is based on multiphysics Finite Element Method simulations using a commercial software tool. ©EDA Publishing/THERMINIC 2009.",

Supersonic clusters beam deposition (SCBD) has been shown as a viable route for the production of nanostructured thin films. Due to high deposition rates, high lateral resolution, low temperature processing, SCBD can be used for the direct integration of nanostructured films on micro-fabricated platforms with limited or no post-growth processing. Here we present the industrial opportunities for batch fabrication of chemical sensor microarrays having nanostructured films of transition metal oxides as active elements, deposited on micro-fabricated substrates.

Results show that the implantation depth scales linearly with the momentum of the cluster, with a stopping power which depends on cluster size. We have particularly investigated the effects of the size and the geometry of the cluster on the implantation into the graphite substrate. A sort of universal behavior, which unifies different elements and different cluster geometries, can be recognized by scaling the momentum with the cluster projected surface. The stopping power of the cluster while penetrating the HOPG surface has been investigated for each cluster size, and a \"molecular effect\" is recognized, meaning that the stopping power is not additive in the number of atoms of the cluster.",
