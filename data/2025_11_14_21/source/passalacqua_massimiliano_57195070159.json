This paper presents a detailed analysis of the efficiency, power loss, and THD characteristics of multiplexed multilevel converters and neutral point clamped converters. Using MATLAB<sup>®</sup>Simulink 2024b, the switching and conduction losses of both multiplexed multilevel converters and NPC converters are calculated. The three-level NPC converter offers advantages of a simpler design, reduced component count, and cost effectiveness with the drawback of low voltage quality. Simulation results validate the THD, power losses, and efficiency for the conventional three-phase three-level NPC converter and the three-phase multiplexed multilevel converter, and a detailed comparison is performed.",

      "abstract": "A direct torque control (DTC) algorithm with synchronous modulation for high-power induction motors is presented in this paper. While maintaining the dynamic response and robustness of a PI-based DTC operating in the stationary reference frame, the proposed scheme is able to keep an integer PWM modulation ratio, adjusting the stator flux angle and the switching period at each control step so that the synchronicity condition is always satisfied. In this way, it is possible to achieve an improvement of the very low-frequency harmonic spectrum of the torque, in particular by reducing torque sub-harmonics. These represent one of the main problems associated with low-frequency modulation typical of high-power drives and their reduction allows to avoid drawbacks such as resonance and mechanical stresses. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated with experimental tests on a small-scale test bench.",

      "abstract": "A medium voltage induction motor drive for a submarine oil pump is considered in this paper. In the considered application, the inverter is located on the oil platform, whereas the submersible oil pump is located under the sea and it is supplied with a 20-km long cable. Moreover, an LC filter is located at the inverter output on the platform. In addition, since all the motor sensors should be maintained with submarine robots, stator voltage, stator current and rotor speed sensors are not installed on the motor for reliability reasons. In this study, a new sensorless control is developed. The proposed control integrates a voltage drop compensation and a stator voltage-current estimation into a sensorless control based on a Luenberger Observer. The effectiveness of the proposed control is proved by experimental tests on a low voltage motor, on a 6.6 kV-710 kW motor and on a 2.1 MW-10.5 kV motor.",

The converter is designed to interface renewable energy sources and electric storages like supercapacitors or batteries, particularly in electric or hybrid vehicles and distributed generation systems. The proposed algorithm, first introduced in [1], calculates optimal duty cycles for the switches based on target conditions derived from reference values of source currents, achieving precise and fast response. Moreover, Discontinuous Conduction Mode (DCM) is exploited at low current levels, to increase efficiency. Experimental tests on a laboratory prototype demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness and robustness to parametric uncertainties, as well as its superiority over a traditional PI-based method in terms of dynamic response.",

However, hybrid configurations, such as those integrating supercapacitor systems, are nowadays widely studied due to their potential to enhance efficiency, driving performance, and component lifespan. Supercapacitors offer significantly higher power density than batteries, making them valuable for FCEVs adoption. In this paper the use of battery and supercapacitors in a FCEV is investigated and the resulting energy consumption is compared under real road conditions. In addition, experimental tests have been carried out on Li-NMC battery cells and simulation tests have been conducted to validate the presented analysis.",

      "abstract": "A new topology of multi-input bidirectional DC-DC converters is proposed in this paper. The converter has a boost behavior, i.e., the output voltage is higher than the sum of the input voltages. This family of converters is particularly suited for hybrid energy storage systems, where different DC sources are connected together and where the output voltage is significantly higher than the voltage of a single storage. The proposed converter reduces the number of required switches, leading to higher efficiency and reduced complexity compared to traditional n-input converters. The new topology demonstrates superior performance by enabling higher efficiency with fewer components. A dedicated control, based on PI controllers, is provided to ensure stable operation under dynamic conditions. The effectiveness of the proposed solution is tested using experimental results on a four-input 20 A/100 V converter prototype.",

      "abstract": "This article presents a new control algorithm for matrix converters based on full-state feedback. An H2-linear matrix inequality (LMI) framework has been adopted to expand the system stability region. The proposed approach differs from other stabilization methods proposed in literature by its ability to increase the power transfer through the converter while maintaining high control bandwidth and preserving the quality of input and output quantities. A Kalman filter has been introduced to estimate the full system state avoiding the installation of additional sensors. Furthermore, the method has a limited computational burden not requiring high performance control platform. Experimental tests compare the performance of the proposed strategy with a stabilization approach previously proposed in terms of stability performance and power quality.",

A new feed-forward current control for this DC–DC converter with three switches is presented in this paper. The modulation technique proposed in the literature for the aforementioned converter leads to a consistent loss reduction at low load, exploiting the DCM. As a drawback, when using this control strategy, the dynamic response worsens significantly. To speed up the control, a feed-forward approach is designed and implemented using a simplified converter electrical model. The proposed strategy is compared with the conventional PI controller, and it is validated and verified through simulation results in the MATLAB/Simulink/PLECS environment and through experimental tests using a converter prototype.",

The motor is usually connected to the inverter drive with a cable of tens of kilometres and sensorless control is a must since sensors can be replaced only with the use of submarine robots. For these reasons, instability phenomena can occur. To overcome these issues, a new control is proposed in this study, involving a compensated sensorless FOC algorithm based on the Luenberger observer. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is tested with simulations considering the MV drive parameters. Moreover, experimental tests are carried out on a small scale LV prototype.",

      "abstract": "In this work, a nonlinear behavioral circuit model is proposed for air-gapped ferrite-core inductors working up to magnetic saturation. The model comprises a nonlinear conservative inductor, with current-dependent inductance, and two linear resistors, accounting for losses in both the winding and the core. Two representations are proposed for the nonlinear inductance, parameterized by both the number of turns and the air-gap length. The model (in both versions) is identified and validated through experimental measurements collected on a real buck converter. Inductor voltages and currents are used for parameter identification. The obtained results exhibit a good match with the experimental measurements used for validation purposes. An example of the application of the model to the design of a buck converter exploiting partially saturating inductors is also proposed.",

      "abstract": "In this article, a V/f control for high-power induction motor drives is analysed. In such uses, low dynamics in terms of speed-loop bandwidth is usually required. However, in some applications, where the load consists of a long shaft with certain mechanical components and with some resonant frequencies, instability and torque oscillations can cause significant damage. For these reasons, open-loop V/f control could be a winning solution, since it avoids resonances and oscillations caused by measurement feedbacks in the control. However, instability may arise also in open-loop V/f control. A stability analysis is here carried out analytically and a new method to overcome oscillations by varying dynamically the V/f ratio is proposed. The stability analysis and the effectiveness of the proposed method are verified with simulation results on a 2.8 kV-7.25 MW induction motor and with experimental tests on a small-scale 380 V-10 kW motor.",

      "abstract": "Battery storage systems are fundamental in UPS applications. UPSs are exploited when high reliability is required. A DC-DC converter is typically used to interface the battery to the inverter to match the different voltage levels. In normal operation, the battery of the UPS is not used and it intervenes only during grid blackout. However, the battery is subjected to deterioration and UPS intervention could fail. In medium and high power UPS, more battery modules are connected in series. If one battery is damaged, all the series is affected. To prevent this issue, a new double-input DC-DC converter is presented in this paper. The two DC sources can be controlled separately, resulting in a system reliability improvement. In addition, the damaged battery is not bypassed; hence the overall system performance can be maximized, since the deteriorated battery can provide energy at a limited rate. Additionally, the proposed converter allows batteries based on different technologies to be mixed together, achieving the best performances from each technology.",

      "abstract": "High-frequency signal injection sensorless algorithms are widely studied and used for rotor angle estimation in permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) at low speed or standstill. One of the main drawbacks of such methods is the acoustic noise connected to the voltage injection. In order to minimize this problem, it is advisable to increase the frequency of the injected signal. Thus, many studies focus on square-wave injection at the switching frequency, which is the maximum theoretical frequency. Since these methods exploit the rotor magnetic anisotropy, it is relatively easy to use them in interior PMSMs, where the rotor anisotropy is high. On the contrary, it is hard to exploit them in surface PMSMs, which have an almost symmetric rotor, although a low rotor magnetic anisotropy is still present. In this article, a sensorless algorithm with switching frequency square-wave injection is developed for surface PMSMs. To increase the signal-to-noise ratio, current oversampling is exploited. The benefits of such a technique are demonstrated with experimental results on a 2 N·m SPMSM.",

      "abstract": "Sensorless control of permanent magnet synchronous motors is nowadays used in many industrial, home and traction applications, as it allows the presence of a position sensor to be avoided with benefits for the cost and reliability of the drive. An estimation of the rotor position is required to perform the field-oriented control (FOC), which is the most common control scheme used for this type of motor. Many algorithms have been developed for this purpose, which use different techniques to derive the rotor angle from the stator voltages and currents. Among them, the so-called passive methods have gained increasing interest as they do not introduce additional losses and current distortion associated instead with algorithms based on the injection of high-frequency signals. The aim of this paper is to present a review of the main passive sensorless methods proposed in the technical literature over the last few years, analyzing their main features and principles of operation. An experimental comparison among the most promising passive sensorless algorithms is then reported, focusing on their performance in the low-speed operating region.",

      "abstract": "In this article, a novel approach to determine the model of an independently controlled neutral leg is proposed. Based on this model, a cascaded control method is developed to provide a steady neutral point connection for a three-phase four-wire inverter and to balance the two dc capacitors voltages of a split dc-bus. Validation of the model is realised by simulations and the control has been tested by experiments. Results have shown good performance even with a high level of neutral current, which demonstrate the ability of the system to work within an unbalanced load or grid.",

      "keywords": "Permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSM) | Sensorless control | Speed control",
      "abstract": "Sensorless algorithms for PMSM have achieved an increasing interest in the technical literature. They can be divided into active methods and passive methods. Active methods exploit rotor anisotropy by injecting high voltage frequency signals, whereas passive methods are based on observers. Even if passive methods do not have the drawbacks of active methods - acoustic noise, torque ripple and harmonic distortion - their effectiveness is reduced in the low speed region. For this reason, active methods are usually used at low speed and the motor control switches to passive methods in the high-speed region. Since high frequency injection is associated to many drawbacks, the aim of passive methods is to work at lower speed as possible or, ideally, to be able to start directly the motor. That is particularly true for Surface-Mounted PMSM: since they have a low anisotropy, high frequency injection should be particularly elevate to achieve sufficient signal-to-noise ratio. It is difficult to compare the performance of passive algorithms proposed in the technical literature since experimental tests have been done with different conditions: motors, inverter features, measurements, type of tests, etc. In this paper, five different sensorless passive algorithms for Surface-Mounted PMSM, selected among the most promising algorithms available in the technical literature, are compared, performing the same tests on the same experimental setup, to achieve a fair comparison and establishing the most performing one.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, part of the efforts of the electric drive researcher has been focused on the study of sensorless control algorithms that allow controlling the machine without a speed measure and with ever-fewer measurement devices. This article proposes a possible solution for the submarine application of an asynchronous motor. The motor is designed to drive a petrol pump at a depth of three thousand meters. The motor is fed by an inverter that is located on an offshore platform, and they are connected through a filter and a cable that is 19.74 km long. In this application, it is not suitable to use a speed measurement device; in fact, at this depth it is important to use as few components as possible, in order to increase the system reliability. A control algorithm that only needs available electrical measures is proposed below.",

      "abstract": "Asynchronous machines are always widely used in most industrial applications due to their reliability, flexibility, and manoeuvrability. To achieve variable speed operations, the quite simple open-loop V/Hz control is largely utilized. Under open-loop V/Hz control, the nonlinear interaction is well known to cause current and torque oscillations while operating at low to medium speeds under light loads. This article presents the stability analysis of induction motors at low–medium frequencies under no-load conditions with the V/Hz control. A system representation in the form of state space is discussed, and the region of instability is plotted against the V/f plane. Two novel and refined methods for the mitigation of oscillations in the region of instability are presented. The two proposed algorithms are finally tested and validated through simulation on an inverter-fed induction motor drive system.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, a double-input bidirectional DC-DC converter is taken into account. The converter allows to use less switches than a traditional solution and, moreover, it guarantees a higher efficiency. The modulation strategy proposed in the technical literature allows the converter to work in Discontinuous Conduction Mode at low-load and, therefore, to increase the efficiency in comparison to the CCM. However, such a control reduces the dynamics of the converter. To improve the transient response, a Feed-Forward approach is proposed in this paper. Since the converter model in DCM is complex and highly nonlinear, a simplified model is considered. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is proved with experimental results on a converter prototype.",

      "abstract": "The necessity to meet strict constraints on vessels emissions leads to a progressive adoption of innovative dc native energy sources. These sources are converter interfaced, and need to be integrated with the traditional power station. Two main converter control families are proposed in the literature: the grid-following and the grid-forming. This paper investigates the condition in which a converter interfaced unit, equipped alternatively with these type of control schemes, and a traditional diesel generator of comparable size, simultaneously contribute to the shipboard frequency and voltage regulation. A laboratory test bench has been developed to reproduce the shipboard power system, and to evaluate its regulating performances using either the grid-following or grid-forming strategy. The results are compared with a base case in which only the traditional diesel generator sustains the microgrid. The conclusions on the assessments of the different strategies are presented, considering the practical feasibility of such systems for actual seagoing shipboard microgrid.",

      "abstract": "Rotor position estimation in sensorless control of PMSM at low speed or standstill is often obtained using high-frequency voltage injection. This method leads to some drawbacks, the main of which is acoustic noise. The frequency of the injected signal should therefore be increased to minimize this problem. A square-wave signal injection at the switching frequency is the subject of many studies, since this is the maximum theoretically achievable frequency. These methods are based on the exploitation of the rotor magnetic saliency and therefore they are widely used with interior PMSMs. On the contrary, the low anisotropy that characterizes surface PMSMs makes it difficult to obtain a good signal-to-noise ratio. A method that uses square-wave voltage injection at the switching frequency is proposed in this study for surface PMSMs. In particular, a new current oversampling method is developed, in order to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. Experimental results on a 2 Nm surface PMSM are showed, to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.",

      "abstract": "The use of series architecture nowadays is mainly on hybrid buses. In comparison with series-parallel and parallel architectures, which are usually exploited on medium-size cars, the series architecture allows achieving internal combustion engine higher efficiency. The downside of this architecture, due to a double energy conversion (i.e., mechanical energy converted in electrical energy and electrical energy converted again in mechanical energy), is that additional losses are introduced. For this reason, the parallel and the series/parallel architectures were considered more suitable for hybrid medium-size cars. Nevertheless, the use of new technologies can change this scenario. Regarding storage systems, supercapacitors achieved a significant energy density, and they guarantee much higher efficiency than battery storage. Moreover, the use of wide-bandgap components for power electronic converters, such as silicon carbide devices, assure lower losses. In this scenario, the series architecture can become competitive on medium-size cars. This paper shows a review of.",

      "abstract": "Sensorless algorithms for Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (PMSM) have achieved increasing interest in the technical literature over the last few years. They can be divided into active methods and passive methods: the first inject high‐frequency signals exploiting rotor anisotropy, whereas the second are based on observers. Recently, a sensorless control based on a rotor flux observer has been presented in the technical literature, which gives very accurate results in terms of rotor position estimation and robustness. In this paper, the aforementioned observer is considered and a procedure for choosing stabilizing gains of the observer is proposed. The contribution of the paper is three‐fold: the mathematical modelling of the rotor flux observer, the methodology for the definition of the observer gains, and the presentation of the experimental results.",

      "abstract": "A double-input bidirectional dc-dc converter, with an innovative architecture, exploiting the use of only three switches, is taken into account in this article. The modulation strategy proposed in the technical literature for controlling such a converter leads to a very low efficiency at low-load because the converter is only able to operate in continuous conduction mode when currents are low. A new modulation strategy, for exploiting discontinuous conduction mode, is here proposed. The efficiency increase is evaluated with a MATLAB/Simulink Plecs simulation model. The control algorithm and the simulation model are validated with experimental results carried out on a converter prototype.",

      "abstract": "Sensorless algorithms for Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (PMSMs) are widely studied in the technical literature. Active methods are based on high-frequency voltage injection, have the advantage of working in the low-speed region and at standstill, but they have some drawbacks such as acoustic noise, additional losses, and torque ripple. Passive methods, on the other hand, do not require the injection of additional signals, however, their performance deteriorates significantly in the low-speed region. Many observers are studied in the technical literature. However, it is difficult to perform a fair comparison among the proposed algorithms since the conditions in which the experimental tests are carried out are always different. Indeed, different studies perform different tests (i.e., with different speed and torque profiles) and with different test benches. The aim of this paper is to make a fair comparison between four different passive algorithms, selected among the most promising proposed in the technical literature. For all the algorithms same tests are performed using the same Surface PMSM test bench.",

      "abstract": "A novel induction motor direct torque control (DTC) algorithm with synchronous modu-lation is presented. Compared to the traditional DTC method, whose main drawback is the presence of low‐frequency torque harmonics (sub‐harmonics), in the proposed method, the PWM switching frequency is imposed to be an integer multiple of the main supply frequency. This is achieved by continuously adjusting the PWM switching period to significantly reduce low‐frequency harmon-ics. The devised algorithm has been tested on an inverter‐fed induction motor drive system, and the obtained results show an important reduction of the sub‐harmonic spectral content of the developed torque with respect to a conventional direct torque control while maintaining at the same time a high dynamic response.",

The quite simple V/Hz control strategy is one of the most commonly used strategies to control induction motors speed, due to its simplicity and ease of implementation. However, using this strategy for controlling high power induction motors may cause instability in some regions, leading to high oscillations in currents and in motor torque. Therefore, the authors propose an improved version of the V/Hz control strategy, which compensates for these oscillations by correcting the speed reference using the stator current. The results obtained are presented, showing excellent results in compensating for these oscillations in motor currents and torque.",

      "abstract": "Permanent magnet synchronous motor sensorless algorithms for low speed region are usually based on rotor anisotropy. Although many studies showed a good behavior of this type of control, high frequency voltage injection is required, which causes loud acoustic noise in addition to electrical losses. On the other hand, methods based on back electromotive force or rotor flux observer, which guarantee high performance in the medium–high speed region, do not required voltage injection. In this paper, a rotor flux observer based algorithm performance is analyzed, in order to extend its use also in the low speed region. Behavior both with no-load, linear torque, quadratic torque, constant torque and compressor-load torque is tested, especially focusing on motor starting. Improvements to rotor flux observer algorithms available in the scientific literature are discussed and their effectiveness is verified by experimental results.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, starting from the measurements available for a 2000 cm<sup>3</sup> turbocharged diesel engine, an analytical model of the turbocharger is proposed and validated. The model is then used to extrapolate the efficiency of a power unit with a diesel engine combined with a turbocompound system. The obtained efficiency map is used to evaluate the fuel economy of a supercapacitor-based series hybrid vehicle equipped with the turbocompound power unit. The turbocompound model, in accordance with the studies available in the technical literature, shows that the advantages (in terms of efficiency increase) are significant at high loads. For this reason, turbocompound introduction allows a significant efficiency improvement in a series hybrid vehicle, where the engine always works at high-load. The fuel economy of the proposed vehicle is compared with other hybrid and conventional vehicle configurations.",

The converter was used to interface two storages, (e.g., supercapacitor and battery) to the DC link. A refined model was created in MATLAB/Simulink Plecs environment and it was used to compare the traditional four-switch converter (i.e., two DC-DC converters in parallel connection) with the innovative three-switch converter. Loss and efficiency contour maps were obtained for both converters and a comparison between them was performed. A prototype of the three-switch converter was realized and used to validate the simulation thermal model by comparing both efficiency and current waveforms obtained with simulations and experimental tests.",

      "abstract": "One of the most important innovation expectation in railway electrical equipment is the replacement of the on-board transformer with a high power converter. Since the transformer operates at line-frequency (i.e., 50 Hz or 16 2/3 Hz), it represents a critical component from weight point of view and, moreover, it is characterized by quite poor efficiency. High power converters for this application are characterized by a medium frequency inductive coupling and are commonly referred as Power Electronic Transformers (PET), Medium Frequency Topologies or Solid-State Transformers (SST). Many studies were carried out and various prototypes were realized until now, however, the realization of such a system has some difficulties, mainly related to the high input voltage (i.e., 25 kV for 50 Hz lines and 15 kV for 16 2/3 Hz lines) and the limited performance of available power electronic switches. The aim of this study is to present a survey on the main solutions proposed in the technical literature and, analyzing pros and cons of these studies, to introduce new possible circuit topologies for this application.",

      "abstract": "The large-scale spread of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) in the automotive industry is dominated today by continuous variable transmission parallel powertrain as far as medium size car are concerned. As a matter of fact, the tendency in this sector is to design parallel architectures in that they have provided until now a higher overall powertrain efficiency. However, technological improvements in many electric components and their increased efficiency can reshape this vision and give new outlines on HEV structure design. This paper aims to show the potentials of the series architecture, thanks to the latest electrical improvements especially in storage systems and power electronics. In particular, simulation models and fuel consumption data over different road missions are presented for the series architecture proposed in this study. In addition, a comparison between these results and data available in the scientific literature for state-of-the-art HEVs is reported.",

In this paper, rotor flux observer based sensorless algorithm performance is analyzed, specially focusing on behavior at low speed.

The sensorless method is based on rotor flux observer and, differently from methods based on motor anisotropy, it does not require high frequency voltage injection; therefore, it does not cause additional losses and acoustic noise. The aim of this paper is to evaluate sensorless behavior in the low speed region, where performance of methods without high frequency voltage injection generally worsen. In particular, motor starting with rated torque at standstill and with intermittent torque is analyzed. Regarding self-commissioning algorithm, the estimation of motor parameters becomes crucial if this algorithm is used together with sensorless control, since the estimated values not only are used to realize the motion control (e.g., field oriented control) but also to estimate rotor position. Sensorless algorithm sensitiveness to motor parameter uncertainties is investigated. Experimental results are shown, using four different motors of various sizing.",

      "abstract": "The increasing interest in Hybrid Electric Vehicles led to the study of new powertrain structures. In particular, it was demonstrated in the technical literature how series architecture can be more efficient, compared to parallel one, if supercapacitors are used as storage system. Since supercapacitors are characterized by high efficiency and high power density, but have low specific energy, storage sizing is a critical point with this technology. In this study, a detailed analysis on the effect of supercapacitor storage sizing on series architecture was carried out. In particular, in series architecture, supercapacitor storage sizing influences both engine number of starts and the energy that can be stored during regenerative braking. The first aspect affects the comfort, whereas the second aspect directly influences powertrain efficiency. Vehicle model and Energy Management System were studied and simulations were carried out for different storage energy, in order to define the optimal sizing.",

In these high-voltage, high-power application fields, a high efficiency is mandatory. In this regard, an interesting and promising development opportunity could be to make soft-switching the elementary converters of the submodules (cells), half H-bridges or full H-bridges, obtaining at the same time the advantage of increasing the switching frequency. The-Active Resonant Commutated Pole Converter (ARCP) or the Auxiliary Quasi Resonant DC-link Inverter (AQRDCL) soft-switching topologies appear adequate for this purpose.

In particular, CVT powertrains can count the highest number of sales in the HEV industry. In spite of this fact, in depth electrical losses analysis of this configuration and the introduction of more efficient electric component question the adoption of this powertrain as the model of energy efficiency. This paper aims to summarize the main results available in the scientific literature on this topic. It is firstly shown a fuel consumption comparison between the two parallel powertrains, secondly a brief description of the main electric component innovations is reported in order to fully understand the effects they have on the series architectures. Lastly, a fuel consumption comparison between the most efficient parallel solution and the series architecture is shown for the purpose of identifying the most efficient powertrain architecture.",

      "abstract": "Hybrid vehicles have experienced a great boom in recent years thanks to the increasing spread of 'parallel' architectures, often realized by a planetary gear train (Hybrid Synergy Drive). At the same time, an enhancement of electrical and electronic components has been experienced; these improvements especially concern reliability and efficiency. Particularly, the possibility of using supercapacitors with increasing storage performances makes possible to manage higher power flows together with a superior efficiency. These innovations may challenge the architecture used nowadays on medium size cars. The hybrid series architecture, which allows the optimal management of the combustion engine, has been disadvantaged until now by the electric powertrain efficiency. In the current scenario, this architecture could benefit from the above-mentioned technology, becoming a competitive alternative to the actual powertrain configurations. The aim of this article is the efficiency analysis, in order to evaluate the operational energy efficiency achievable thanks to this configuration. This analysis will be carried out considering all the possible working conditions of the different powertrains.",

      "abstract": "A great boom of hybrid vehicles has taken place on the automotive market in recent years, in particular, all these vehicles are now equipped with a continuously variable transmission (CVT) thanks to the use of a planetary gear train and two electric motor-generators. The benefit provided by this system is the possibility to optimally control the engine velocity from an energy standpoint; in addition, drive comfort is increased thanks to the continuously variable transmission. However, this is obtained at the cost of some amount of electrical losses in the components necessary to realize the above-mentioned structure. This paper aims to evaluate the overall efficiency of this particular power train on different road missions; the same missions will be simulated at the same time for an identical hybrid vehicle equipped with a conventional transmission system. In order to perform an energy analysis of the two architectures, one has to accurately address the main components generating energy losses: it will be thus presented the set of equations from which the mathematical stationary model of the CVT was obtained and how the different electric components and the internal combustion engine were modeled. In addition, a brief description on the CVT optimization logic will be reported, the validity of this process will be then confirmed by comparing the ICE working points deriving from it and those declared by Toyota. Finally, the fuel economy values coming from various road simulations will be compared in order to determine if or which hybrid architecture proves to be the most efficient one.",

At the same time, storage systems and power electronics have experienced some important innovations. The development of supercapacitors has permitted management of high power with elevated efficiency. Moreover, the availability on the market of silicon carbide components has allowed a significant reduction of power electronic losses. These improvements may challenge the hybrid architecture used in medium size cars nowadays. On one hand, series architecture would relevantly benefit from an electric powertrain efficiency increase, on the other hand, these innovations would generate low benefits in parallel architectures.
