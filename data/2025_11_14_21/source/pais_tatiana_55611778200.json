      "abstract": "When it comes to composite materials, a fundamental difference arises from the isotropic materials, contrary to the latter case, the stratified nature of composites inevitably generates anisotropy in the structural behavior of the laminates. Instead of two independent variables as for steel or aluminum, glass-reinforced plastic (GRP) requires at least five independent variables, that are calculated upon micromechanics assumptions. This article evaluates the accuracy of a method based on the Classical Laminate Theory to calculate the equivalent laminate properties in computing the natural frequencies of structures in GRP yachts. Natural frequencies are evaluated beforehand with the results of the beam theory, subsequently, Experimental Modal Analysis (EMA) is conducted to validate the analytical results, being a benchmark for comparison. The study aims to assess the validity of a laminate equivalent mechanical properties method when used to determine the natural frequencies, reducing the time needed in the preprocessing phase of most common FEM software.",

      "keywords": "Carbon emission reduction | Corrugated plate | Finite Element Model | Methanol | Yacht",
      "abstract": "In the pursuit of sustainable solutions to reduce carbon emissions, the maritime industry is increasingly focusing on transitioning from fossil fuels to alternative fuels. Methanol offers significant environmental benefits, including Well-to-Wake greenhouse gas emission reductions of 95% with synthetic methanol and 89% with green methanol. Gray methanol can increase emissions by 20% compared to marine diesel oil. Methanol reduces sulfur oxides by 99%, nitrogen oxides by 60%, and particulate matter by 95%. However, its lower energy density requires 75% larger storage volumes to maintain comparable ranges. This study explores retrofitting a 60-meter yacht for methanol propulsion, addressing structural, spatial, and safety challenges associated with converting existing vessels into more environmentally sustainable ships. Key innovations include compact cofferdams, reduced from 800mm to 100mm, and corrugated bulkheads, improving tank efficiency from 0.32 to 0.83 while preserving safety. A Finite Element Model validated the structural integrity of these solutions, confirming their ability to withstand operational stresses while meeting stringent safety standards. Methanol propulsion provides a 23% range reduction compared to diesel, a trade-off balanced by its environmental advantages. This work highlights the interplay between structural modifications, onboard capacity enhancements, and alternative fuels in maritime decarbonization, contributing to more sustainable and responsible yacht transportation.",

      "keywords": "damping | insertion loss | Noise | vibration | yacht",
      "abstract": "The insulation and noise and vibration damping characteristics of complex systems used by humans, such as automobiles, airplanes and ships are becoming increasingly important from the early design stages to ensure an adequate level of comfort. Especially in the naval fields, the design of insulation plans is crucial to prevent the propagation of noise and vibrations on board of megayachts. Since it is quite complex to identify and correctly model the sources due to their deterministic and random nature, during the early design stage, the focus is on insulation rather than reducing the acoustic levels of the sources themselves. In this article, a method for analyzing sea trials on a superyacht will be proposed with the aim of analyzing how much the insulation materials can limit the levels of vibrational energy on board during the path between sources and receivers. A new a descriptor based on harmonic transmission energy through the structure is proposed for path insertion loss experimental identification. In particular, by using spectral analyses and synchronous averaging of sound levels in various areas of the superyacht, it will be possible to study the vibroacoustic insulation of structural materials and their damping coefficient.",

      "abstract": "High operational vibrations in ships can lead to discomfort for passengers and crew and cause structural fatigue and cracking. Reducing these vibration levels under working conditions requires an understanding of both the characteristics of the excitation sources and the vibrational structural dynamic behaviour of the system in question. For accurate forced response vibration calculations, it is crucial to correctly identify resonant frequencies, mode shapes, and damping values through experimental methods, as these are essential for validating the results. Experimental Modal Analysis (EMA) is a widely used technique across many engineering fields that allows for the identification of modal parameters. However, EMA cannot be applied under operating conditions; it requires artificially exciting the system and measuring both the input force and the output response vibrations on an experimental grid of the structure. This identification technique can be challenging, costly, or even unfeasible for large and massive structures such as cruise ships. As an alternative, Operational Modal Analysis (OMA) can be used to experimentally extract modal parameters from response-only measurements. This paper presents the identification of two similar cruise ships using OMA, utilizing data collected during sea trials from endurance, crash stop, and propeller run-up tests. The testing procedures and the results obtained are presented and compared.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents an experimental investigation carried out on a large pleasure yacht during a sea trial using vibration signal processing methods to characterize its dynamic operational behaviour and to identify contributions of the main sources acting on the system including the onset of the propeller cavitation phenomenon. Synchronous averages were computed to isolate vibration components associated with a specific source acting on the system. Their use jointly with variance computation allowed the detection of the rise of cavitation. Spectral Kurtosis analysis suggested optimal-bandwidth of the filter for system response demodulation and so better identify the rise of high frequency energy of bursting contents induced from cavitation strictly linked to propeller rotation. Cyclic modulation spectrum was also adopted, which allows to extract the modulation features of cyclostationary signals, shows the rise of an interaction between high frequency contents and blade passage phenomenon approaching cavitating condition. The results seem to provide an interesting solution based on the vessel vibrational response to define source contribution to the targets for a better identification of the dynamic system. Moreover, the proposed diagnostic methods reveal reliable tools for real time condition-based monitoring of the marine propeller to distinguish cavitation and wake energy contribution using vibrational response measured on the hull instead of hydrophone arrays.",

Consequences to structural integrity or comfort may be assessed through numerical analysis, model tests or full-scale measurements influenced by varying key quantities.

ISSC2025 technical committee on dynamic response initiated a benchmark to investigate user introduced uncertainties in prediction of quantities like extreme response, frequencies, damping and fatigue damage from “true” measurement data from a storm event. The uncertainties in half hour predictions are significant by comparing half hour results and predictions from many users.

The provided approach can overcome this lack and it is based on considerations and calculations of real aerodynamic forces and the experimental evaluation of the pretension load of stays and shrouds.

      "abstract": "Current standard laboratory measurements of sound transmission loss properties of ship bulkheads at low frequencies, below 100 Hz, are not accurate enough due to the non-diffuse acoustic field of typical laboratory volumes. However, what has been recently observed in non-diffuse field conditions is the transmission of source modes into the receiving room through the partition. On the basis of this, in this paper, a novel procedure to determine the laboratory airborne sound transmission loss properties of ship bulkheads at low frequencies through the airborne modal sound transmission loss is investigated. It is defined as the difference between the average sound pressure levels of source room modes peaks that occur in both source and receiving rooms. A correction method is proposed to suppress the influence of natural receiving room modes. Normalization terms related to receiving room volume and modal damping are introduced, and an envelope method is applied to extend the results in third octave bands. Measurements on five different ship bulkheads show that the standard transmission loss in the low frequency range provides unlikely results, whereas the proposed descriptor follows the expected theoretical curve. This evidence confirms the validity of the proposed method, at least for comparison purposes in marine applications.",

      "abstract": "Goal based and limit state design is nowadays a well-established approach in many engineering fields. Ship construction rules started introducing such concepts since early 2000. However, classification societies’ rules do not provide hints on how to verify limit states and to determine the structural layout of submerged thin-walled stiffened cylinders, whose most prominent examples are submarines. Rather, they generally offer guidance and prescriptive formulations to assess shell plating and stiffening members. Such marine structures are studied, designed and built up to carry payloads below the sea surface. In the concept-design stage, the maximum operating depth is the governing hull scantling parameter. Main dimensions are determined based on the analysis of operational requirements. This study proposes a practical concept-design approach for conceptual submarine design, aimed at obtaining hull structures that maximize the payload capacity in terms of available internal volume by suitably adjusting structural layout and stiffening members’ scantling, duly accounting for robustness and construction constraints as well as practical fabrication issues. The proposed scantling process highlights that there is no need of complex algorithms if sound engineering judgment is applied in setting down rationally the hull scantling problem. A systematic approach based on a computer-coded procedure developed on purpose was effectively implemented and satisfactorily applied in design practice.",

      "abstract": "In recent years a growing need in naval acoustics for the characterization of low frequency materials below 100 Hz and particularly from 50 Hz has been observed. The problem related to airborne and impact acoustic insulation at low frequencies is becoming more and more relevant due to the considerable impact of sound sources at these frequencies, such as audio-video systems in theaters and discos as well as TV systems inside cabins. Current measurement procedures for identifying the sound insulation properties of bulkheads and floors are not sufficient to ensure repeatable and reproducible measurements, as accuracy and precision values are too low to be accepted when applied at frequencies below 100 Hz. In fact, at low frequencies and in ordinary laboratory or room volumes between 40 m3 and 80 m3, the acoustic field is no longer diffuse due to the dominant presence of standing waves or modes, which result in large fluctuations of the sound pressure level in space and frequency. In the present study, an experimental methodology based on the modal approach is proposed and applied for the study of low-frequency sound insulation phenomena below 100 Hz in the naval field. An extensive experimental activity has been conducted at CETENA laboratories in Riva Trigoso, which has allowed to validate the measurement procedure and compare it with classical theories of sound transmission. The development of this approach seems to be able to provide significant support in the design phase for the optimization of shipboard sound insulation performances.",

This technique is commonly developed and well-established in the automotive field. In contrast it has not been applied to in naval architecture yet, accounting for the complexity of the path, the higher number of the receivers' locations and the many sources on board (e.g. engine, propeller, generator, pumps..). In this paper, the Polytechnic School of the University of Genoa, together with Cetena, presents a preliminary approach for applying the TPA technique in the marine field to a cruise ship.

      "abstract": "The current design philosophy for submarine hulls, in the preliminary design stage, generally considers as governing limit states material yielding along with various buckling modes. It is common belief that, beyond the design pressure, material yielding of the shell plating should occur first, eventually followed by local buckling, while global buckling currently retains the highest safety factor. On the other hand, in the aeronautical field, in some cases structural components are designed in such a way that local instability may occur within the design loads, being the phenomena inside the material elastic range and not leading to a significant drop in term of stiffness. This paper is aimed at investigating the structural response beyond a set of selected limit states, using nonlinear FE method adopting different initial imperfection models, to provide the designers with new information useful for calibrating safety factors. It was found that both local and global buckling can be considered as ultimate limit states, with a significant sensitivity towards initial imperfection, while material yielding and tripping buckling of frames show a residual structural capacity. In conclusion, it was found that the occurrence of local buckling leads to similar sudden catastrophic consequences as global buckling, with the ultimate strength capacity highly affected by the initial imperfection shape and amplitude.",

It is now recognized that the underwater noise generated by human activities and in particular shipping noise can be harmful for the marine fauna and therefore urgent actions must be taken to tackle the problem. To this aim a virtuous example is represented by the Port Authority of Vancouver (CA) that, since 2017, has introduced important incentives and tax relief for those ships that prove to be particularly virtuous in terms of noise emissions radiated into the water. Up to now, most of the attention has been paid to study and characterize the noise emissions of large commercial ships due their worldwide diffusion. To this aim several measurements protocols have been issued both by international bodies (ISO, ANSI/ASA) both by the main classification societies. A lack of data is on the contrary present regarding pleasure crafts both as regards small boast and large yachts. In the present paper data coming from an experimental campaign for the measurement of the underwater radiated noise of one large yacht built by the SanLorenzo shipyards is presented. Noise has been measured for several operative conditions and speeds ranging from zero to maximum speed.",

      "abstract": "Acoustic insulation optimization of the ship decks to contain impact noise is generally obtained by adopting suitable types of viscoelastic resilient materials. For this purpose, it is necessary to be able to make a correct choice of material. This is obtained by experimentally identifying the vibro-acoustic behavior of the combined semi-reverberant room and floor system according to an ISO standard (ISO 16283-2). These tests are generally onerous as they require the availability of the floor with both trimmed and untrimmed configurations. In addition, qualified technicians are needed to correctly spread the material on the floor. Finally, after the test has ended, the material must be removed and disposed of properly. To reduce this wasted time and cost, in this paper, a new methodology is proposed that predicts the vibro-acoustic behavior of the floor and viscoelastic material assembled together starting from separate dynamic information of the two components. Once these two elements are properly experimentally identified, the proposed method foresees the vibro-acoustic response of the overall system in presence of an impact footfall excitation.",

      "abstract": "High performance sailing yachts are generally designed assuming high local and global loads transmitted by rigs to hull structures. The above-mentioned loading conditions can become critical for large hulls also in terms of displacements when composite materials are used. In this scenario, it is very important to use lightweight and high-performance materials, such as carbon fibres. In fact, also some ‘non structural’ components, such as outfit and furniture, are built in carbon fibres and, therefore, can be considered contributing to the hull local and global strength. The aim of this work is to investigate the contribution level of those ‘non-structural’ components to the hull strength. Two different finite element models of a 94 ft sailing yacht, with and without ‘non structural components’, have been carried out in order to evaluate their contribution to the primary hull response to longitudinal bending moment and dock tuning load.",

      "abstract": "After a long period of crisis and uncertainty the yacht market seems to exit from the tunnel. Many shipyards are developing new interesting projects, especially for vessels over 50 m in length. The high intrinsic value of these vessels fosters technical offices to deepen the research on some critical subjects to increase competitiveness. The onboard comfort, with particular reference to vibrations, is probably one of the key aspects of this trend which nowadays drives most of the design choices relatively to structure lay out and materials for interior outfit. A great help comes from Classification Society new rules and regulations for the evaluation of noise and vibration. The so called “Comfort Class Rules” contain the general criteria for noise and vibration measurements in various yacht areas and suggest maximum limit values as a function of the required quality level of the yacht. In this paper a study carried out in cooperation between the University of Genova and a leading Italian shipyard on the dynamic behaviour of superyacht structures is presented. A detailed FEM analysis of the global and local natural frequencies of a 60 m superyacht was carried out in order to evaluate the reliability of simplified procedures based on reduced numerical models. The investigation has been carried out by two different FEM codes and the numerical results have been compared with experimental data measured during the construction of the vessel.",

      "abstract": "The prediction of the comfort level on board yachts in their early design stage is the present challenge for designers. This can be achieved by using calculation methodologies suitable to predict the dynamic behaviour of the unit in terms of vibration and noise. In the design stage, the most used approach is a finite element (FE) analysis carried out on numerical models as close as possible to the real structural lay out. Nevertheless, whatever is the mesh definition, rough or fine, the parameter that heavily influences the behaviour of a numerical model is the water added mass which increases the yacht total mass and modifies the vibration mode frequencies. In this paper, the added mass of a yacht is studied, by comparing the added mass obtained by the well-known Lewis formulation and the one obtained by numerical calculations is carry out.",

From this point of view, vibrations and noise represent a difficult issues to deal with for designers, both in the initial phase of the project, when it is necessary to have preliminary information about the response of the structure not yet defined, and during construction, in case some critical behaviors arose in any part of the structure. In this paper, the dynamic behavior of a 40 m motor yacht is investigated. The Vibration Velocity Spectra obtained by the numerical model of the yacht are compared with the value of level limits imposed by the ISO6954:1984. Different structural solutions are investigate to improve the comfort level in same area not in compliance with the rule.",

      "abstract": "The growing increase in length of super and megayachts has driven structural designer to adopt longitudinal layouts as a main point in the structural scantlings. By the way, the optimization of weights, strength, deformations and dynamic behaviour has to be assessed one off for each new units because of peculiar and unique characteristics of each vessel. For this assessment, in particular considering the dynamic behaviour of ribbed plates, the use of numerical software based on the Finite Element (FE) Methods is largely used up to the early design stages in order to highlights benefit and weakness of a particular structural design. In this paper, two different structural layout for a superyacht deck have been studied and tested by using a FE software: the first one has been created with longitudinal and transversal stiffeners with the same cross section. In the second layout, transversal stiffeners are smaller in dimension but with lower span. The comparison has been made in terms of maximum strength, deformation and dynamic behaviour.",

In this respect, they perform the very important function of absorbing and mitigating the vibrations of operating components that they are connected to. As soon as engines are started up, both at rest and when sailing, they produce annoying airborne and structural vibrations and noise. Air and structure borne noise depend on the intrinsic dynamic characteristics of both engine and engine supporting system. In recent years, a new double-stage mounting system, called “raft mounting”, has been developed in order to drastically reduce the structure borne noise transmission of superyacht medium speed diesel engines. In this paper, an investigation on the performances of a double stage mounting system installed on a superyacht is carried out.",

The main objective of this work is not to prove the already known advantages of the insertion of a thrust block in the propulsion system, but, rather, to study the adjustment of the original configuration to the variations proposed in the shaft line arrangement. Different possible modifications of the structure are tested on a partial model of the vessel, in order to study the response of the engine block's supporting structure when subjected to selected loads.",

      "abstract": "Comfort levels on modern superyachts have recently been the object of specific attention of the most important Classification Societies, which issued new rules and regulations for evaluating noise and vibration maximum levels. These rules are named “Comfort Class Rules” and set the general criteria for noise and vibration measurements in different vessels’ areas, as well as the maximum noise and vibration limit values. As far as the vibration assessment is concerned, the Comfort Class Rules follow either the ISO 6954:1984 standard or the ISO 6954:2000. After an introduction to these relevant standards, the authors herein present a procedure developed to predict the vibration levels on ships. This procedure builds on finite element linear dynamic analysis and is applied to predict the vibration levels on a 60 m superyacht considered as a case study. The results of the numerical simulations are then benchmarked against experimental data acquired during the sea trial of the vessel. This analysis also allows the authors to evaluate the global damping ratio to be used by designers in the vibration analysis of superyachts.",

In case the resulting noise and vibration levels were not acceptable, the shipyard can apply corrective actions to reduce their effects before the construction phase. The usual way to perform a reliable predictive analysis is by using finite element technique; in this perspective the result reliability depends on the numerical model quality. In case of a ship an important parameter which heavily influences the dynamic behaviour of a numerical model is the water added mass; in this paper, this subject is studied by theoretical and numerical methods. A comparison between the added mass obtained by the well known Lewis formulation and the numerical results is carried out. In a first phase, a simple study case is investigated and after that the added mass of a study case superyacht has been calculated by a numerical approach.",

      "abstract": "When the assembling of hull structure is completed, the sides of metal motor yachts are usually affected by bumps and hollows coming from welding plates to each other and plates to frames. These defects, normally tolerated on merchant ships, cannot be accepted on superyachts for which the external surface must be smooth and glossy. For this reason the surface finishing is achieved by a long and delicate process of filling, fairing and painting. The final result of this process is very important for the yacht aesthetics as the general appearance of the vessel depends on the external painting. As a matter of fact the quality of painting depends mainly on the undercoat preparation to assure an adequate grip and, most of all, a perfect smooth and faired surface. Despite accurate preparation and painting, surface conditions can undergo undesired alteration because of excessive heating due, as an example, to a long exposure to solar radiation. While stresses do not reach significant values because of the relatively low intensity of thermal loads, strains could still cause very slight surface distortions and undulations which are perceived by human eye as a surface defect. The phenomenon becomes particularly evident if the surface is painted with a dark colour. In this paper an investigation on the influence of temperature on the stress and strain distribution of aluminium light alloy plates coated by filler layers of different kind and thickness is reported. The study has been performed by FEM structural analyses calibrated by experimental measurements performed on laboratory specimens. This work represents the continuation of a research begun some time ago with the measurement of temperatures on yacht hulls exposed to solar radiation in different conditions.",

      "abstract": "After a long period in which the most attractive characteristic of a motor yacht was represented by her maximum speed, nowadays the target has moved towards comfort on board which became the fundamental parameter to deal with in the yacht design process. Noise and vibration, together with seakeeping behaviour, became the fundamental subjects on which the research effort of shipyards and technical offices turned on. Since many years the Department of Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunication Engineering and Naval Architecture (DITEN) is involved in a research on the dynamic behaviour prediction of large motor yachts in cooperation with one of the most important Italian shipyards. In this perspective the assessment of the dynamic properties of materials used for the vessel construction, such as the damping coefficient, is an important step to perform preliminary analyses for vibration and noise levels. This paper is focused on the definition of the damping coefficient of laminated glass, which is a complex material commonly used for windows in the current yacht market. As a matter of fact the actual trend of using larger and larger windows for owner's cabins and saloons could represent a critical point in terms of noise and vibrations and makes the laminated glass dynamic characterization a fundamental issue to be investigated. Different experimental modal methods to obtain the damping coefficient at natural frequencies are applied to laminated glass specimens, while the Reverberation Time test is proposed to assess the coefficient in the whole frequency range of interest. In the final part of the paper, a comparison between the results of different methods is presented.",

      "abstract": "The comfort on board is a fundamental parameter to deal with in the yacht design process. The acoustic comfort is a condition that has to be pursued in the yacht design process in order to meet the owner requirements and to allow the crew to work safely. The essential part of a ship propulsion system is the propulsion shaft line. The excitation forces originated from the shaft line can greatly affect the dynamic response of the whole ship structure. Yacht designers and builders are continuously looking for new solutions to reduce the noise and vibration on board a vessel. Within this context, the technical office of the Vulkan-Italia has developed a flexible coupling which, because of its modular and compact design, fits the installation requirements and guarantees excellent performance in terms of noise and vibration. In this paper, the operation principle of the elastic joint is explained and a numerical whirling vibration analysis is carried out. The whirling vibration analysis is able to check the shaft line with regards to vibrations due to the rotation of the shaft line and the hydrodynamic effects of the propeller.",

      "abstract": "The present financial crisis is imposing shipbuilders to reduce costs and construction times in order to prevent orders cutback. In yacht design studios, based on improved aesthetics, this goal cannot be accomplished by simply skimping internal and/or external furnishing, but it must be achieved by reducing weights and costs of structural components, without compromising the structural strength of the super yacht. In this scenario, superstructure scantling is becoming the most critical aspect of structural design as they are built by using materials, like aluminum light alloy, which have low mechanical characteristics. The actual trend of having very big openings on the hull sides, because traditional windows have been drastically enlarged to offer suggestive landscapes to the owners and their guests, further worsens the problem. Furthermore, the aforementioned cost and weight cutback is achieved by reducing beam scantling dimensions and plate thicknesses to the minimum imposed by the Classification Society Rules; this trend might became very dangerous if loads acting on the yacht are not thoroughly assessed during the preliminary design stage. In this paper, the structural response of aluminum light alloy superstructures is studied by a finite element approach, coupled with static and dynamic loads imposed by the Classification Society Rules, with particular attention related to the buckling phenomena that occurs to slender stiffeners around windows.",

      "abstract": "The comfort level on board superyachts depends on a variety of parameters all dealing with the human perception of various phenomena such vibrations, noise, ship motions and son on. In this work, the attention has been strictly devoted to vibrations and on possible solutions to reduce them. This kind of analysis is a challenging task for designers and a relevant subject for shipyards that are seriously engaged to find solutions aimed at improving the quality of their products. In this perspective, current numerical methods represent a reliable predictive tool in the design phase to identify natural frequencies of the hull and local structures. The adoption of “Tuned Mass Damper” system could be a suitable solution both at the design stage, when for the sake of weight containment heavy structure reinforcements should not be advisable and after construction when any other intervention is not possible. In this paper, the application of such device on decks of yacht is presented. TMD numerical models are created and tested to identify the main parameters characterizing a dynamic absorber, then two passive control devices, able to easily conform to the yacht deck geometry, are tuned to decrease the vibration level of the sun deck zone.",

Therefore, a jeint research project was set up by Baglieoa Shipyards of La Spezia and the University of Oenoa to analyse the temperature distribution over yacht hulls, followed by the interactions between the metal hull and the epoxy filler layer. Tins paper analyses the first phase, based on an analytical approach, parametric modelling and experimental investigations.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, comfort is becoming the principal goal for designers. But what does onboard comfort really mean? It is possible to define it as a sense of physical or psychological ease, often characterized as a lack of hardship, and it is therefore a subjective sensation. In fact, the perception of a comfort condition is due to a complex mechanism in which the different senses are involved and interact with each other. When trying to improve the comfort onboard, it should be considered that the interaction between the surrounding environment and the people on board is realized through the perception of stimuli related to hearing (noise), smell, breathing and transpiration (air quality and temperature), the sight (aspect of the environment), physical contact (vibration) and the sensation of movement of the body in space (ship motions). Until now, the most important Classification Societies impose severe rules and regulations only for the evaluation of noise and vibration maximum levels for different zones of the ship. Many other aspects that influence the comfort on board are currently under study. The incentive to provide the market with more comfortable products gave rise to high awareness for the analysis of sound transmission and absorption of the main materials used in shipbuilding. There are two driving parameters to describe the behavior of sound absorber materials: Transmission Loss (TL) and Insertion Loss (IL). In case of metals, with particular reference to steel, it is well known that the internal damping is very low. In contrast, there are so-called viscoelastic materials, which show high dissipation of mechanical energy. In this paper, a measurement campaign in real scale, carried out to investigate the dynamic behavior of different materials used to absorb vibration and sound propagating through steel decks, is described. During the tests, a comparison of velocity level measured under the naked metal plate obtained from experimental data and from finite element analyses has been carried out. Furthermore, the TL and IL values of the four different floor configurations obtained from experimental data are compared to understand which type of floor shows the best damping behavior.",

      "abstract": "Comfort on board is a fundamental parameter to deal with in the yacht design process. In the framework of this study, the assessment of the dynamic properties of materials used for the vessel construction, such as the damping coefficient, is an important step to perform preliminary predictive analyses for vibration and noise levels. This paper is focused on the definition of the damping coefficient of laminated glass, which is a really complex material commonly used for windows in the current yacht market. As a matter of fact the actual trend of using larger and larger windows for owner's cabins and saloons could represent a critical point in terms of noise and vibrations and makes the laminated glass dynamic characterization a fundamental issue to be investigated. Different experimental modal methods for obtaining the damping coefficient at natural frequencies are applied to laminated glass specimens, while the Reverberation Time test is proposed to assess the coefficient in the whole frequency range of interest. In the final part of the paper, a comparison between the results of different methods is presented.",

      "abstract": "The value of a super-yacht project can be measured in terms of cost, size, autonomy, design and lately also in terms of comfort on board, since the competition among the various shipyards is now being played on quality of living onboard, as well as on more traditional aspects such as design, cost and performance. Since the on-board comfort has become a performance parameter, the vibration and noise level are topics of increasing interest to ship-owners, ship designers and builders. The engine-mount loading is the primary source of vibrations onboard boats. Indeed, the increased sophistication of the on board outfitting has required lower limits levels on vibration and noise over the last decade. By contrast, the current trend aims at producing faster ships, equipped with increasingly powerful engines, which imply, in the absence of proper measures of contrast, higher levels of vibration and noise. In order to improve the comfort level onboard their superyachts, Azimut|Benetti Shipyards, in cooperation with the Naval Architecture Section of the DITEN Department of the University of Genova and with the DIA Department of the University of Trieste, began an investigation campaign of the dynamic response of the marine Diesel engine foundations. The dynamic behavior of the Diesel engine foundation is a paramount importance to evaluate its effectiveness in the coupling system between the Diesel engine and the ship structures. An accurate study of the dynamic behavior of these elements allows both avoiding high levels of vibrations in the low frequency range and limiting the structure-borne noise levels in the high frequency range. The knowledge of dynamic response of Diesel engine foundations is a key factor for the comfort assessment in the first phase of ship and superyacht design with regards to noise and vibration characteristics. Given the labour time needed to perform a dynamic FE analysis, with particular reference to mobility analyses, in this study a procedure to individuate the optimum dimensional characteristics of engine foundations numerical models has been performed, in order to achieve in reasonable calculation times reliable results. The investigation has been supported by a wide measurement campaign by which it has been possible to make a validation of numerical results.",

      "abstract": "Understanding the methods to evaluate the comfort on board ships through direct measurements of the vibration levels is crucial for obtaining accurate results, and so a clarifying explanation of the methods required by the ISO 6954:1984 would be useful. The checking is performed using a Maximum Repetitive Value (MRV) that is not clearly defined, nor specified in which circumstances or for which dimension of the ship it should be used or not. Neither has an explanation been given to the use of a conversion factor that inherently represents time dependent vibration phenomena, modulation, which depends on the Sea State. The Crest Factor represents these modulations, and depends on the Sea State and ship dimensions. It is important to understand better the parameters that affect the Crest Factor to evaluate better the comfort on board ships. Some Classification Societies give guidelines on how to use the ISO standard in question, but they do not always cover certain aspects that must be considered. In the paper, suggestions on how to use the standard are given, approaches from Classification Societies are analyzed and a procedure to obtain MRA and the Crest Factor generated. Different influencing factors to the Conversion Factor and the MRA, such as time length and position of the measurement during testing and filter type, have also been analyzed to obtain a more accurate value of the Crest Factor.",

      "abstract": "High quality aesthetics are a de-facto necessity on large luxury yachts and it is for good reason that the classic colour of the conventional yacht fleet has been unsurprisingly white. However, an increasing number of owners are opting for dark colours, which unfortunately have a tendency of absorbing greater solar heat. This leads to wavy thermal expansions over the hull, destroying its aesthetic appeal. Other problems such as degradation of hull coatings and increased energy needs to maintain thermal comfort are also manifested. To overcome this, solutions like stronger scantlings, expensive hull coatings and larger ship cooling systems are being used. More systems dramatically increase a ship's weight and cost. Therefore, a joint research project was set up by Baglietto Shipyards of La Spezia and the University of Genoa to analyse the temperature distribution over yacht hulls, followed by the interactions between the metal hull and the epoxy filler layer.

In this work, performed in cooperation between Azimut|Benetti Shipyards and the Department of Naval Architecture of the University of Genova, a complete review of the existing rules is presented, together with a case study developed on a 60 meters superyacht, on which a detailed FEM investigation has been carried out in order to investigate the dynamic behaviour of hull and superstructures. The results of modal and transient analyses are compared with a first series of experimental data gathered during the vessel construction. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group.",

      "abstract": "The EU Trans-European network \"motorways of the sea\" concept aims at introducing new intermodal maritime-based logistics chains in Europe, which should bring about a structural change in transport organisation. These chains will be more sustainable, and should be commercially more efficient, than road-only transport. Motorways of the sea will thus improve access to markets throughout Europe, and bring relief to the over-stretched European road system. The design concept presented in this paper is a high speed vessel to compete with road transport and air transport, supported by specialised infrastructure to optimise the vessel loading and unloading process for cars and HGVs. The vessel design combines the following functions: high speed ferry as an alternative to HGV road transport; passenger ferry as a alternative to flights; luxury cruising cabins. It is based on a 120m trimaran platform designed to operate at 40 knots as a coastal cruiser in the Mediterranean, connecting the coast of Spain, France and Italy. This project is an engagement in Design-Driven Innovation (DDI), with the objective of changing the design meaning of what a multi-purpose commercial vessel can be, proposing the CLF as a new market sector for the commercial marine industry. The key driver is sustainable luxury, as the vessel is multifunctional, providing a high speed alternative to less sustainable modes of transport. This addresses the growing European definition of green luxury and could create a new market sector between cruise ships and high end passenger ferries, reducing motorway traffic and hence logistics carbon footprint.",

      "abstract": "One of the most important aspect of superyacht design is represented by the comfort on board in terms vibration and noise performances. These characteristics have been recently the object of specific attention by most important Classification Societies which issued new rules and regulations for the evaluation of noise and vibration maximum levels. Such rules, usually named as \"Comfort Class Rules\", contain both the general criteria for noise and vibration measurement in various yacht areas, and maximum limit values which such measurements should fall into. Comfort Class Rules derive from the well known ISO Standard 2000 formulation, \"Mechanical vibration - Guidelines for the measurement, reporting and evaluation of vibration with regard to habitability on passenger and merchant ships\". In order to improve the comfort level onboard their superyachts, Azimut|Benetti Shipyards, in cooperation with the Naval Architecture Section of the DITEN Department of the University of Genova, decided to start a comprehensive investigation on the dynamic behaviour of superyacht structures. The first phase of this activity has been represented by a complete review of existing comfort rules of most important Classification Society, a synthesis of which is presented in this work. Then a case study developed on two different 60 meters superyachts, on which detailed FEM investigations have been carried out in order to investigate the dynamic behaviour of hull and superstructures. The results of modal and transient analyses are compared with a first series of experimental data gathered during the vessel construction. © 2013: The Royal Institution of Naval Architects.",
