In this context, the availability of a reliable 6-DOF parametric, modular, and robust model is highly advantageous at early design-stage. The here presented mathematical model is based on strip theory for calculating the linear forces on the bare hull, combined with non-linear cross-flow drag forces. The contribution of control surfaces and the sail are evaluated using a formulation derived from experiments and literature data, allowing to consider the specific geometry of the exposed surfaces and the hull sections on which they are mounted, thus including all mutual interaction effects between the various components, such as the body-wing and wing-body. In this first part of work a comparison between the results of the manoeuvring code and experimental data or other data available in literature is presented, demonstrating satisfactory reliability and robustness with a view to estimating stability and controllability.",

      "abstract": "This study presents an experimental approach to study the dynamics of tip vortex cavitation. The selected case study is a four-bladed model-scale controllable pitch propeller tested under specific flow and operational conditions. The proposed method integrates high-speed video recordings with advanced computer vision techniques to quantitatively assess the characteristics of cavitating vortex dynamics, focusing in particular on the variation of vortex volume as a function of the propeller blade’s angular position. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach enables precise measurements of vortex dynamics, offering valuable insights for future investigations. Specifically, direct access to these measurements may facilitate the study of how vortex cavitation dynamics influence the spectral characteristics of radiated noise. Such insights are crucial for developing and validating underwater noise spectrum predictive models that comprehensively describe the noise sources.",

      "abstract": "An in-depth understanding of submarine control surfaces hydrodynamics during manoeuvring is a crucial step for reliable prediction methods at all design stages. In this paper, a CFD based approach using a viscous RANS code is presented. The use of CFD allows a better understanding of the underlying physics to properly tune a modular framework in the well-known MMG approach, with the aim to better capture the effect and mutual interactions of different hull and sail configurations. The proposed method considers the actual flow around the stern planes interacting with the hull, including the amplification of forces given by the body-wing and wing-body interactions and considers the straightening effects of hull during manoeuvre. This paper tries to overcome the actual lack of available experimental evidences in literature for these topics. The understanding of this phenomenon, rarely considered in literature, is important in terms of design of the depth control system of the submarine while sailing. In the present study, the two standard configurations for stern plane installation are considered, namely cross- and X-planes, highlighting the differences in behaviour and hydrodynamic interaction due to configuration changes.",

      "abstract": "In the last years, an increasing attention has been devoted to ships Underwater Radiated Noise (URN), with the progressive introduction of noise reduction Guidelines by international organizations such as IMO, Classification Societies voluntary notations, limits and incentives in specific areas. In this context, a large effort has been spent in the study of cavitating propeller noise since it represents the dominating noise source on ships. Over the years, the University of Genoa has developed strategies for propeller design by optimisation aimed to the reduction of cavitation and noise as a side effect, limiting possible negative consequences on the propulsion efficiency. In the context of the EU-funded LIFE-PIAQUO project it was possible to perform a complete optimisation activity, starting from a real test case (a small passenger boat operating in Mediterranean marine protected areas) and retrofitting the propellers for dedicated sea trials. The present paper reports the main results of these activities, highlighting the capability of the proposed methods, through a comparative full-scale validation of the outcomes of the design activity.",

      "abstract": "The present study aims to investigate the fundamental dynamics of cavitation through an experimental approach. The study involves developing and testing a computer vision technique to measure the critical characteristics of a cavitation state. The experimental campaign was designed to investigate the dynamics of bubble cavitation developing on a NACA 0015 hydrofoil. The hydrofoil was tested under working conditions with an angle of attack of zero and a flow velocity of V=8[m/s]. The experiments were performed for several cavitation numbers, acquiring a dataset of high-speed videos for each. These videos were analysed using the methodology presented to extract quantitative data that described the observed cavitation state. The article describes each phase of the developed technique in detail, illustrating step by step the solutions adopted to solve the problems faced. The analyses’ results highlight the potential of this approach. Indeed, the characteristic features of the cavitation conditions were measured with high accuracy. These quantities are difficult to access using the techniques commonly used to observe cavitation. The results provide valuable insight for an in-depth understanding of the cavitation phenomenon and the detrimental effects it generates.",

      "abstract": "The objective of the present study is to investigate by model tests the erosion caused by blade root cavitation for a set of three marine propellers. Experiments have been carried out using soft paint technique together with cavitation observations in the UNIGE cavitation tunnel. Three standard cameras and one high speed camera have been used to observe the damage patterns and cavitation dynamics, respectively. Standard cameras are fixed on the top of test section to continuously monitor the effect of erosion damage on the blade root, the high-speed camera has been placed at different positions to investigate detailed evolution and collapse of bubbles on pressure and suction side of propeller blades. Soft paint results showing damages pattern have been analysed simultaneously with the high speed videos, and showed remarkable agreement between the occurrence of damage on the blades and the bubble collapse of cavitation. The proposed methodology allows comparing different propellers in terms of cavitation aggressiveness. The comparison of these results with full-scale data provides useful indications to propeller designers when root cavitation cannot be avoided.",

      "abstract": "During the early design stage of an underwater vehicle, the correct assessment of its manoeuvrability is a crucial task. Conducting experimental tests still has high costs, especially when dealing with small vehicles characterized by low available budget. In the current investigation, virtual towing tank tests are simulated using the open-source OpenFOAM library in order to assess the reliability of CFD methods for the prediction of hydrodynamic forces and moments. A well-known case study, the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) SUB-OFF model, is used, and the outcomes are compared to the experimental results available in the literature. Five different configurations are investigated for pure drift tests, rudder tests and pure rotation in both vertical and horizontal plane. The results show an overall good agreement with the experimental data with a quite low demanding mesh arrangement of 3M cells, a favourable balance between accuracy and computational time. In more detail, the expected error in the most significant forces during manoeuvres is less than 2% for the fully appended configuration (the submarine real operative condition), whereas the accuracy is moderately reduced for the barehull configuration (a case not representative of a real hull) with an expected error of 15%. A possible reason for the differences observed could be attributed to the description of the two streamwise vortices generated when manoeuvring. Apart from the lateral force and yaw moment, the results of the longitudinal force are also presented, having a greater disparity when compared to the experimental data. Nevertheless, the longitudinal force has no important role for the purpose of making stability and control predictions. The study contributes to the validation and consolidation of CFD methods, offering insights into their accuracy and limitations for practical applications in underwater vehicles.",

      "abstract": "In the context of numerical self-propulsion predictions, the literature on high-speed marine vehicles (HSMV) is still relatively scarce. Actually, extensive numerical analyses are rarely considered for these applications because of the not-so-stringent design constraints and contract requirements concerning these crafts and also thanks to the advantages of series production. On the contrary, with the growth of the market requests, in particular, in the direction of Greenhouse Gas Reduction, the exact knowledge of the vessel working point, in terms of speed and engine configuration, pushes the researchers to investigate all the factors which deeply define the propulsion condition. In the present paper, two existing vessels have been numerically studied using a robust and industrially affordable procedure based on some simplified viscous Computational Fluid Dynamic approaches to predict the self-propulsion working points. The obtained results have been then compared with available sea trials showing a very high agreement even if some uncertainties in both the experimental measurements and the CFD results still exist. The impact of these uncertainties has been further investigated to assess the reliability of the self-propulsion prediction, showing that the maximum speed can be obtained with an uncertainty of about 1 knot and 10% of the corresponding engine load. A more robust prediction can be obtained by including the uncertainty assessment in the propulsion analyses. The validity of the proposed analyses is further supported because the numerical uncertainty falls inside the uncertainty obtained from the available full-scale measurements, so defining a more robust prediction of the vessel propulsion point for design purposes.",

      "abstract": "The employment of twin pod-drives is spreading nowadays through the fleet of modern twin-screw vessels. The adoption of this steering device is of interest for both new-buildings and for retrofit because of the high manoeuvring effectiveness in restricted waters, free-sailing efficiency, hybrid-electric optimal engine control room space optimization and noise-comfort. In terms of manoeuvring, in particular, the control system offers great side-stepping and turning ability. On the other hand, the pod configuration could result in poorer course-keeping and yaw checking abilities at high-speed due to the more open stern shapes, together with the reduced appendages extension. In this respect, the IMO yaw-checking ability, represented by the usual overshoot angles of the zig-zag manoeuvre, should be carefully checked since an early stage. In this work, a simulation tool specifically developed to deal with twin rudder or twin pod ship configurations is described and validated against experimental results. Then, a first application of the tool is shown, presenting the results of a comparative study of spade and flap rudder setups against pod-driven units for a specific group of ships, allowing to show that, in this case, a proper design of pod units is not detrimental of the yaw checking ability.",

Blade root cavitation erosion was documented on three model-scale controllable pitch propellers using a combination of soft-paint techniques and high-speed videos. Three different image processing techniques have been applied to the high-speed videos to investigate the dynamics of the cavitating structures. For each of these techniques, the relative strengths and weaknesses are presented and discussed. The results show the dynamics of the cavitating structures obtained by applying these image processing techniques and support further work to correlate the cavitation behavior with erosion damage.",

      "abstract": "Low transverse metacentric height and high speed are peculiar destabilising factors in ship manoeuvrability according to the attainable large heeling angles. The phenomenon indeed occurs in the case of vessels characterised by loading conditions with low transverse stability — e.g. high centre of mass of container vessels and RoRos. Starting from Kijima's single-screw container vessel evidence, an extension of the study to twin-screw ferry vessels is undertaken, with the scope of quantifying its effect in terms of turning and zig-zag IMO margins at an early design stage. Given the relevant impact, an enlarged captive model testing campaign executed on a sample of reference vessels was analysed to further characterise and extend the concepts to a broader class of modern single and twin-screw vessels, thus motivating the study. As a further result, this analysis allowed to underline the need of a review of the IMO intact stability code when dealing with heeling angle during a turn.",

      "abstract": "Submarines’ manoeuvrability both in intact and degraded operating conditions is the main design concern starting at the very early stages of design. This increased complexity of the design process compared to a surface vehicle can only be handled by using dynamics numerical simulations on both the vertical and horizontal manoeuvring planes. To this aim, a 6-DoF method is presented, validated, and applied to study the manoeuvring characteristics of several vessels. The analysis has been conducted considering two standpoints, i.e., to verify the design handling capabilities of the vehicles at low and high speeds and to study the off-design residual abilities in the eventual case of emergency operations with jammed/lost-control surfaces. The influence of different design features, such as, e.g., the stern plane “+” and “x” configurations, fairway size and positioning, hull dimensional ratios and restoring capabilities have been analysed in terms of impact on turning ability, course and depth changing abilities, and vertical/horizontal course stability, including the vertical damping ratio and critical velocity.",

      "abstract": "A deep insight into the manoeuvring characterisation of a wider class of Azimuthal Stern Drive Escort tugs (ASD) is undertaken with the scope of defining a real-time parametric manoeuvring simulation code for the free-sailing and towing operations. In the part I of the work a physics-based 4-DOF prediction parametric tool for the dynamic behaviour of the ASD tug has been developed, and a validation with model-scale Escort-towing tests has been presented. In the present paper a second validation methodology, based on full-scale measurements, is discussed. This verification envisages simulator's capability of describing the free-sailing performance of a different but compatible hull, having dimensions, propulsion, skeg characteristics significantly different with respect to the “parent design” used to develop the tool. The experimental campaign involves the measurements purposely performed during sea trials onto two sister-ship ASD new-buildings (RM3213). Turning circle, zig-zag manoeuvres, and Dieudonne’ spiral tests are deeply analysed and the results used for validation purpose. The simulation results showed a satisfactory agreement with the full scale manoeuvres, positively demonstrating the ability of the parametric mathematical formulations to forecast customised tug manoeuvrability for tug design purposes.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this study is to experimentally investigate the cavitation erosion on the blade root of a model scale controllable pitch propeller. Tests are carried out in a cavitation tunnel, using the soft paint technique to study cavitation erosion, exploiting also two standard cameras and one high speed camera to study the damage patterns and cavitation dynamics, respectively. Standard cameras are placed on the top of test section in order to periodically monitor the occurrence of damages on the layer of paint. The high-speed camera has been used instead to analyse bubble dynamics and identify potentially erosive phenomena. Three different cavitation bubble structures on the blade root have been identified in the present study: streak cavitation, spherical bubble cavitation, and twisting bubble cavitation. The paint tests results have been analysed together with high-speed videos, showing a remarkable agreement between the occurrence of damage and cavitation collapse phenomena. The results demonstrated two regions on the propeller blade root with high risk of erosion: (1) suction side blade root showed significant damage pattern due to single bubble as well as bubble assembly collapse, and (2) pressure side blade root showed slight damage pattern due to spherical bubble collapse.",

      "abstract": "Submarines bring many interesting hydrodynamic challenges that need to be properly addressed to provide precise and reliable information about their performance. Hydrodynamic performance must be evaluated at least in two main operating conditions, namely when it is deeply submerged and at snorkel depth. There are relevant differences in terms of hydrodynamic since the forward speed in the latter condition is typically much lower and of interaction with the free surface. Moreover, submarines used to sail at snorkel depth if they need to accomplish specific tasks, such as communication, that involves the use of surface piercing masts. The proposed study analyses the opportunity provided by different Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) approaches to correctly address submarine performance. The resistance in both conditions, masts free surface hydrodynamics and maneuvering behaviors are addressed. Ad-hoc approaches based on in-house developed numerical procedures and open-source software are presented. Different CFD techniques have been used, including Reynolds Averaged Navire Stokes (RANS), Detached Eddy Simulation (DES) and Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), according to the particular physics that need to be studied.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to investigate the feasibility of a simple but robust approach for the identification of the main interaction effect of hull and propeller on the rudder inflow in a conventional manoeuvring simulator. The manoeuvring simulator adopts a modular/MMG based approach in which the hull, the rudders and the propellers are described by separate mathematical models which take into account the interaction phenomena. The propeller–rudder interaction factor is examined by means of a numerical model developed in OpenFOAM for the prediction of the performance of a rudder in behind propeller condition. Differently the hull–rudder interaction factor is numerically obtained by means of two different approaches. The proposed kinematic method shows the minimum additional computational cost without loss of accuracy. It is based on the analysis of rudder inflow fields (in a PIV fashioned), therefore It can be carried out in a post-processing phase of CFD simulations adopted to extract the hydrodynamic coefficients. This study validates the method by comparing it with the classical approach also used in the experimental campaign, based on the analysis of rudder forces from virtual captive tests. The approaches demonstrate to improve the overall accuracy of the main manoeuvring parameters with respect to the ones obtained by means of a calibrated semi-empirical model.",

      "abstract": "Propeller-induced cavitation dominates the underwater radiated noise emitted by ships, presenting a significant threat to marine ecosystems. Designing mitigation strategies for noise pollution requires predictive models, which are challenging to develop due to the varied, multiscale, and multi-physical nature of the phenomenon. One technique for predicting the propeller cavitation noise source that is rising in popularity relies on the use of computation fluid dynamics (CFD) solutions of the cavitating flow with a volume-of-fluid cavitation model. We measured cavitation induced noise from ten loading conditions of a model-scale controllable pitch propeller in uniform inflow, resulting in four distinct regimes of cavitation. These experimental conditions were reproduced numerically using the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) framework, facilitating direct comparison between the experimental and the numerical results. Vapour cavities attached to propeller blades were adequately simulated, while regimes involving cavities within shed vortices were not reproduced well. The numerical model effectively predicted the qualitative trends of acoustic spectra, but the absolute sound levels were over-predicted. These results provide insight into the necessary components of a successful propeller noise model and outline the advantages and shortcomings of the present numerical framework.",

      "abstract": "Off–design and realistic operative conditions of the propulsion system have been progressively considered a frontier topic for the development of novel and successful design procedures. The availability of high accurate data on propeller performance, both experimental or numerical, is pivotal for the development of reliable tools and the enhancement of traditional ones. In this context, this paper continues the investigation described in (Ortolani et al., 2020), that was dedicated to analyze the single blade loads obtained by oblique towing tests and assess their consistency with those measured during the steady turning phase, reproduced by free running model tests. In this paper, the same analysis is broadened to two aspects. At first, the in–plane forces and moments that are obtained by a conversion from the rotating frame of the measure to the fixed frame are discussed. These loads need quantification, because they are the primary cause of damages of the shafting structure, vibratory loads and also contribute to dynamic response of the ship. Then, the study is switched to the comparison of single blade loads during transient motions of the turning maneuvers, at weak and tight rudder angles, performed at the same reference speed as the captive model test. The analysis lays the basis for the enhancement of ship system (comprehensive) mathematical models, already used in ship design, to real–time analysis of vibratory loads and emitted noise.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to assess the quality of the manoeuvre prediction of a twin-shaft naval vessel by means of a time-domain simulator based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) hydrodynamic coefficients. The simulator uses a modular approach in which the hull, rudders, appendices and propellers are based on different mathematical models. The hydrodynamic coefficients of the hull in the bare and appended configurations are computed using virtual captive tests performed with an open-source CFD code: OpenFoam. This paper demonstrates that the application of the CFD hydrodynamic coefficients led to a good estimate of the macroscopic characteristics of the main IMO manoeuvres with respect to the experimental measures. The adopted test case is the DTMB 5415M frigate both with and without appendages. This test case has been investigated in several research studies and international benchmark workshops, such as SIMMAN 2008, SIMMAN 2014 and many CFD workgroups.",

      "abstract": "A deep insight into the manoeuvring characterisation of a broader class of Azimuthal Stern Drive Escort tugs (ASD) is undertaken with the scope of defining a parametric manoeuvring simulation code for the free-sailing and towing operations. To this end, given a simple set of tug design parameters (main dimensions, skeg size, azimuthal size, propeller pitch, main engines, etc.), a physics-based 4-DOF mathematical prediction tool for the dynamic behaviour of the ASD tug has been developed in calm seas. Two independent validation processes have been provided to prove the suitability of the modelling: the first model-scale, while the second full-scale. The present paper presents the free-sailing full-scale validation of a different but compatible hull, having dimensions, propulsion, skeg characteristics significantly different with respect to the “parent-design” (RM2812) used to develop the code principally. The verification involved the measurements purposely performed during sea trials onto two sister-ship ASD new-buildings (RM3213).",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a methodology to develop the control systems of a surface vessel by using both computational fluid dynamics techniques and model-based control design. The model-based control design is supported by a simulation platform where both the ship hydrodynamics and the propulsion plant are modelled together. The application of CFD is related to the direct evaluation of the hull forces in the ship hydrodynamic model, for different manoeuvring conditions. The developed design tool is essential in the preliminary design phase, as a benchmark to test the control algorithms for autonomous ships. The comparison between numerical assessment and regression-based formulae has been performed on non-standard manoeuvres to quantify the difference in thrust allocation from the point of view of control design. Eventually, to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, the results of the sea trials for different manoeuvres are shown.",

      "abstract": "The proper evaluation of the Rudder-Propeller interactions is mandatory to correctly predict the manoeuvring capability of a modern ship, in particular considering the commonly adopted ship layout (rudder often works in the propeller slipstream). Modern Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solvers can provide, not only the performance of the whole system but also an insight into the flow problem. In the present paper, an open-source viscous flow solver has been validated against available literature experimental measurements in different conditions. After an extensive analysis of the numerical influence of the mesh arrangement and the turbulent quantities on the rudder provided forces, the study focused its attention on the forces generated by the rudder varying the propeller loading conditions and the mutual position between the two devices. These analyses give a hint to describe and improve a commonly-used semi-empirical method based on the actuator disk theory. These analyses also demonstrate the ability of these numerical approaches to correctly predict the interaction behaviour in pre-stall conditions with quite reasonable computational requests (proper also for a design stage), giving additional information on the sectional forces distribution along the span-wise rudder direction, useful to further develop a new semi-empirical rudder model.",

      "abstract": "This paper is related to the technological development of an innovative small-size Autonomous Surface Vehicle designed to meet the requirement of accessing, monitoring and protecting the shallow waters peculiar of the Wetlands. The first prototype of a fully electric, modular, portable, lightweight, and highly-controllable Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) for extremely shallow water and remote areas, namely SWAMP, was developed by CNR-INM and DITEN-Unige. This catamaran is equipped with four azimuth Pump-Jet Modular (PJM) actuators designed for small-size (1 to 1.5 m long) ASV. The main advantage of Pump-Jet thrusters is that they are flush with the hull, thus minimizing the risks of damages due to possible grounding. This system is used to increase the manoeuvrability in narrow spaces and to increase the spacial resolution by allowing the access also in extremely shallow waters with smaller risk of loosing manoeuvrability. The knowledge of the hydrodynamic characteristics of the thruster and of the vessel allows to partly or fully identifying the vessel for a better controllability. With this aim a series of tests have been conducted in the DITEN towing tank. In particular advance resistance on the SWAMP hull in deep and shallow water, bollard pull and self-propelling tests with the Pump-Jet Module working have been carried out. The results of the tests with the effects of advance speed on the PJM performance is reported in this paper together with the description of the modelling of the thruster itself.",

      "abstract": "Mitigation of shipping noise is a topical issue in marine engineering because of the dramatic increase in the levels of anthropogenic underwater noise and its impact on marine life. In recent years, hydro-acoustic research has focussed on the development of reliable methods for predicting underwater radiated noise (URN) due to cavitation, which is known to be the dominant contribution to the overall radiated noise spectrum of ships above the cavitation inception threshold. Model-scale measurements are currently considered the most reliable approach to study URN problems in marine engineering and are crucial for the verification and validation of numerical methods. However, their reliability is affected by several uncertainty sources for which suitable test procedures and post-processing techniques are needed. As a means to better understand the accuracy and reliability of underwater radiated noise measurements, a round-robin (RR) test programme for an open water propeller setup was organized within the Community-of-Practice “Noise” of the HydroTesting Forum, with the aim of comparing results among several institutes (i.e. University of Genova UNIGE, University of Newcastle UNEW, NMRI, SSPA, KRISO, CNR-INM and MARIN). This paper reports an overview of the RR programme and compares the different approaches and results.",

      "abstract": "The importance of reducing the noise impact of ships is being recognised worldwide. Consequently, the inclusion of this principle among the objectives and constraints of new designs is becoming a standard. For this reason, considerable attention is given to the propeller being often the dominant source of underwater radiated noise, especially when cavitation occurs, as it happens in most cases when a ship sails at design speed. The designers of quieter propulsion systems require the availability of predictive tools able to verify the compliance with noise requirements and to compare the effectiveness of different design solutions. In this context, tools able to provide a reliable estimate of propeller noise spectra based just on the information available during propeller design represent a fundamental tool to speed up the design process avoiding model scale tests. This work focuses on developing a tool able to predict the cavitating marine propeller generated noise spectra at design stage exploiting the most recent advances in Deep Learning, able to take advantage of both structured and unstructured data, and in hybrid modelling, able to exploit both data and physical knowledge about the problem. For this purpose authors will make use of a dataset collected by means of dedicated model scale measurements in a cavitation tunnel combined with the detailed flow characterisation obtainable by calculations carried out with a Boundary Element Method. The performance of the proposed approaches are analysed considering different scenarios and different definitions of the input and output variable used during the modelisation.",

This study is devoted to identifying a proper mathematical model to be included in a dynamic manoeuvring simulator. The hydrodynamic problem is therefore decomposed in the hull and skeg components. The hydrodynamic characteristics of the skeg were so explored by varying its span and chord systematically, allowing deep insight into the physics of both components and their mutual interaction. The distribution of the forces acting on hull and skeg were studied in detail in their dependence from the skeg geometrical characteristics. Suitable mathematical formulations for the skeg forces were implemented in an MMG-like manoeuvring model-based onto the CFD captive simulations. Lastly, the impact on the tug's manoeuvrability of the previously mentioned variations was then investigated. Turning, Zig-Zag, Escort Capability, Escort Mirror ability and Escort Stability manoeuvres were simulated. The results of these manoeuvres are presented, showing the great potential of this manoeuvring model in representing a wider class of Escort tugs.",

      "abstract": "An industrial-academic collaboration between Rosetti Marino shipyard and University of Genoa presided over a deep theoretical and experimental insight into the maneuvering performances of a new escort tug family. The presented z-drive azimuthal stern drive class is characterized by high intact/damage stability margins, good maneuvering capability, and stable behavior during escort indirect assistance. The project addresses three main research areas: hydrodynamic design of the hull with escort capability, simulation of the escort capabilities in different operational scenario, and development of control logics that will allow autonomous or unmanned operations. The tug design concept is supported by a customized simulation tool that enables the evaluation of the free-sailing and towing maneuvering characteristics for Azimuth Stern Drive (ASD) tugs at high-speed (Escort) and low speed (Harbor Assistance) in a real-time environment. The paper describes the methodological approach adopted for the design and maneuvering characterization of such a class, across some preliminary results. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculations and towing tank tests have been performed onto a prototype tug hull in order to assess the hull design and to infer simulation models able to describe the behavior of a family of vessels. In particular, the propulsion and maneuverability aspects in escort operations are deeply investigated.",

      "abstract": "Ducted propellers are unconventional systems that are usually adopted for ship propulsion. These devices have recently been studied with medium-fidelity computational fluid dynamics code (based on the potential flow hypothesis) with promising results. However, these tools, even though they provide a good prediction of the forces and moments generated by the blades and the duct, are not able to provide insight into the flow field characteristics due to their crude flow approximations. On the contrary, modern high-fidelity viscous-based computational fluid dynamics codes could give a better description of the near and far-field flow of these particular devices. In the present paper, forces and the most significant features of the flow field around two ducted propellers are analyzed by means of both experimental and computational fluid dynamics approaches. In particular, accelerating and decelerating ducts are considered, and we demonstrate the ability of the adopted solver to accurately predict the performance and the flow field for both types. These results, in particular for the less-studied decelerating duct, designate CFD as a useful tool for reliable designs.",

      "abstract": "The adoption of RANS techniques is widely spread in terms of resistance and self-propulsion prognosis for merchant and military vessels; however, on the other hand, the captive evaluation of hydrodynamic manoeuvring forces across numerical procedures still concerns great computational effort and challenge. When it comes to deal with Escort or tractor tugs, characterised by rather full hull forms, typical of harbour tugs, with the addition of extensive foiled shaped fore-skegs solutions, the ability of predicting manoeuvring and handling of such vessels becomes a great added value at an early design stage, as an alternative to physical model scale testing, since very scarce data are present in open literature. Escort vessels in particular, both operate at low and high speed, in addition to the typical harbour tasks entailed, making the manoeuvring modelling even more complicated. In present work, a low-speed and high-speed numerical methodology based on the OpenFOAM finite volume method on polyhedral unstructured mesh is investigated and validated against purposely designed model tests carried out in towing tank: Pure yaw, pure drift, drift and yaw, and drift and heel simulation results are compared with experimental data in terms of forces first, and impact on manoeuvring lastly, showing satisfactory agreement with experiments. Finally, Escort capability tests run at tank are compared with a purposely calibrated manoeuvring model on the RANS results.",

      "abstract": "Modern paradigms to design complex engineering systems focus on interactive approaches able to simultaneously handle results from multidisciplinary applications. Keeping this in mind and considering that from a ship design perspective the definition of a hull shape is the first step of the whole design process, a reliable computer aided design model for shape representation and morphing becomes a key feature to navigate trough the design spiral. The proposed research focuses on the comparison of two different approaches to handle hull shape variations, namely the fully parametric model and a non-parametric method relying on the free form deformation technique. The comparison is developed considering both the easiness of building the shape of the reference model with its transformations laws and the resulting number of free design variables. The two methods are analyzed in the light of attainable hull shape variation in two design and modification test cases. The first is limited to the bulbous bow of a conventional hull while the second focuses on the whole surface of a fast, displacement, round-bilge hull.",

      "abstract": "Maneuvering motion is a critical off-design condition experienced by the propeller during realistic operations. Failures of the propulsive system, loss of efficiency and modification of the propeller side effects (propeller-hull induced pressure and noise) are the undesired consequences of these working conditions. Free running model tests, still representing the primary approach for a reliable performance assessment, requires facilities and devices that are not commonly affordable; alternatively, rectilinear towing tank can be used for maneuvering investigations by static or dynamic tests and can be a valid alternative to investigate propeller performance in off-design. On these basis, in this paper the propeller performance in maneuvering conditions is investigated by means of oblique towing tests in case of a twin screw model equipped with a novel set-up for single blade loads measurements.In the experiments, the drift angle and the advance speed of the model varied systematically, to focus on the relation between propeller operating conditions and loads. Moreover, the averaged and periodic blade loads are compared, in terms of the equivalent drift angle, to the measurements obtained by free running model tests, in order to demonstrate the reliability of pure oblique flow tests for the preliminary quantification of the off-design loads developed by the propeller.",

      "abstract": "The ability to predict the tug's handling, effectiveness, and safety at early design stage is paramount in view of an optimal design process. In this framework, the availability of a reliable manoeuvrability prediction model is beneficial. This paper presents a novel 4-DOF parametric manoeuvrability model dedicated to the manoeuvrability analysis of Azimuthal Stern Drive Escort Tugs. An extensive captive model testing campaign is exploited to develop the mathematical model, conceived following the MMG model concept. The modelling pursues a physics-based approach aimed at characterising the complete manoeuvring hydrodynamics of the vessel. The hull+skeg and azimuthals force contributions are analysed separately and are then coupled to analyse their interaction. A complete, real-time simulator is presented, which is capable of simulating the dynamics of a towing convoy in several real case scenarios. This capability is envisaged to become a very useful tool for the tug designer, allowing to address realistic operational conditions with a focus on manoeuvring capabilities, risk assessment, risk mitigation, operational safety and effectiveness.",

      "abstract": "Achieving a reliable and accurate numerical prediction of the self-propulsion performance of a ship is still an open problem that poses some relevant issues. Several CFD methods, ranging from boundary element methods (BEM) to higher-fidelity viscous Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) based solvers, can be used to accurately analyze the separate problems, i.e. the open water propeller and the hull calm water resistance. However, when the fully-coupled self-propulsion problem is considered, i.e. the hull advancing at uniform speed propelled by its own propulsion system, several complexities rise up. Typical flow simplifications adopted to speed-up the simulations of the single analysis (hull and propeller separately) lose their validity requiring a more complex solver to tackle the fully-coupled problem. The complexity rises up further when considering a maneuver condition. This aspect increases the computational burden and, consequently, the required time which becomes prohibitive in a preliminary ship design stage. The majority of the simplified methods proposed in literature to include propeller effects, without directly solve the propeller flow, in a high-fidelity viscous solver are not able to provide all the commonly required self-propulsion coefficients. In this work, a new method to enrich the results from a body force based approach is proposed and investigated, with the aim to reduce as much as possible the computational burden without losing any useful result. This procedure is tested for validation on the KCS hull form in self-propulsion and maneuver conditions.",

      "abstract": "In the context of the low speed and high drift angles manoeuvres, a limited number of experimental test cases are available in open literature. Consequently, the ability to reliably predict the hull forces (and the related hydrodynamic coefficients) via computational fluid dynamics calculations may represent a significant added value to further tune or to generate new simplified hull forces models to be employed in a manoeuvring code. Even if some applications can be found in the literature for selected cases and conditions, as those considered in the present work, a more systematic comparison is mandatory to confirm the reliability of these numerical approaches. In light of this, in the present work a systematic application of the open-source viscous-based flow solver OpenFOAM to predict forces at low-speed manoeuvring conditions for two ship test cases (the KCS and the KVLCC) is presented. The proposed numerical setup, specifically designed to be applied in the early ship design stage (limiting computational effort), shows a satisfactory accuracy to cope with the strong off-design conditions related to these specific ship operative conditions.",

      "abstract": "In the latest years, models combining physical knowledge of a phenomenon and statistical inference are becoming of much interest in many real world applications. In this context, ship propeller underwater radiated noise is an interesting field of application for these so-called hybrid models, especially when the propeller cavitates. Nowadays, model scale tests are considered the state-of-the-art technique to predict the cavitation noise spectra. Unfortunately, they are negatively affected by scale effects which could alter the onset of some interesting cavitating phenomena respect to the full scale propeller; as a consequence, for some ship operational conditions it is not trivial to correctly reproduce the cavitation pattern in model scale tests. Moreover, model scale tests are quite expensive and time-consuming; it is not feasible to include them in the early stage of the design. Nevertheless, data collected during these tests can be adopted in order to tune a data-driven model while the physical equation describing the occurring phenomenon can be used to refine the prediction. In this work, the authors propose a hybrid model for the prediction of ships propeller underwater radiated noise, able to exploit both the physical knowledge of the problem and the real data obtained from cavitation tunnel experiments performed on different propellers in different working conditions. Results on real data will support the validity and the effectiveness of the proposal.",

      "abstract": "Model scale experiments represent one of the most effective, and probably the most commonly used, approaches for the study of cavitating propeller noise. Despite this, the acquirement of consistent data of propeller noise from tests in model scale facilities is still a challenging task. Data collected with such an approach are usually affected by several scale effects and facility related issues which make such experiments still very complex. Among others, the effect of the facility itself as acoustical surrounding must be carefully addressed in order to properly estimate propeller source levels in ideal free field conditions. This is currently carried out, when possible, by measuring facility transfer functions and applying such functions as a correction to measured noise spectra. The development of robust procedures for the measurement of these transfer functions is thus very important. In the present work, this problem is addressed by discussing in details techniques, merits and possible problems related to this topic.",

      "abstract": "In adverse situations, such as maneuvering and motion in waves, severe variations of the propeller inflow may be experienced, resulting in an increase of propeller thrust and torque and in the generation of in-plane loads. This may cause undesired hull-vibratory loads, stress of the propulsive system and even affect somehow the ship dynamic response. Thus, a reliable prediction of these phenomena during design phases is necessary to comply with the increasingly stringent constraints on safety at sea, propulsive efficiency, vibration and noise pollution. In the present work, the capabilities of a propeller solver based on a potential, boundary element method, routinely used in the optimization process of the propulsive device, to analyze the propeller performance under different maneuvering conditions are considered. After a first validation against uRANS simulations considering a simple oblique flow, the analysis is broadened to a propeller operating in the wake field of a twin screw ship in different maneuvering conditions, for which experimental results from free running tests in model scale are available. The BEM solver is compared also to a steady blade element approach in order to achieve an overview of the respective pros and cons in view of their inclusion in CFD simulations.",

      "abstract": "Ships underwater radiated noise is a subject of great and increasing interest in naval architecture because of its impacts on the environment and on the on-board comfort. Among the different noise sources, the propeller is usually the dominant one, especially when it cavitates. For this reason a lot of efforts have been spent in studying the cavitation noise spectra in order to be able to predict its main characteristics at design stage. Nowadays, in order to reach this goal, the state-of-the-art solution is to perform model scale experiments. Unfortunately, this requires time-consuming tests in a cavitation tunnel with a model of the propeller and results are affected by scale effects that must be correctly interpreted. For these reasons, in this paper authors propose a hybrid approach which may be adopted to predict the main characteristics of the cavitation noise spectra without requiring an actual experiment. Moreover, the same approach may be used also in order to overcome typical model scale problems. For this purpose a hybrid modelling approach able to exploit both the physical knowledge of the problem and the real data obtained from many cavitation tunnel experiments performed on different propellers in different working conditions have been developed. Results on real data in both interpolation and extrapolation tasks will support the validity and the effectiveness of the proposal.",

      "abstract": "Propeller noise, especially in the presence of cavitation, is usually the main contributor to the acoustic signature of ships. Due to this fact, considerable efforts have been devoted to the study of underwater radiated noise induced by propeller cavitation during years: firstly, for military reasons; more recently, for other reasons relevant for merchant vessels, such as comfort on board and mitigation of the undesired impacts on marine fauna. Different approaches are available for the study and prediction of the cavitation noise, including statistical and CFD based methods as well as approaches based on model tests in cavitation tunnels or depressurised tanks. Amongst these approaches, the model test based approach is still the most reliable and commonly adopted method. However, when the aim of the model experiments is the prediction of noise radiated by a full-size ship, scale effects need to be analysed and taken into account to interpret model scale data and to achieve consistent prediction. Within this framework, each testing facility follows a procedure, which is developed through its own experience, theoretical considerations and possibly semi-empirical approaches to manage the different possible issues. The definition and harmonisations of the standards for the noise test and post-processing procedures of the propeller noise are still within the current tasks of the ITTC Specialist Committee on Hydrodynamic Noise and other standardization institutes. This results in more uncertainty compared to other more established tests such as resistance and self-propulsion. This paper presents the model scale tests carried out at the University of Genova (UNIGE) cavitation tunnel on the model propeller of the Newcastle University research catamaran, “The Princess Royal”. Tests have been carried out using a 2D wake screen to approximate the real ship condition. The details of the experimental setup and results are presented and compared with the full-scale measurements in terms of cavitation and underwater radiated noise. This allows to explore the issues of the scale effects associated with these phenomena, focusing the attention on possible problems related to small-medium size cavitation tunnel.",

      "abstract": "This paper describes a customized thruster for Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASV). The thruster is a Pump-Jet Module (PJM), which has been expressly designed, modeled, constructed, and tested for small-/medium-sized ASVs that perform environmental monitoring in extremely shallow waters such as wetlands (rivers, lakes, swamps, marshes), where water depth is only a few centimeters. The PJM is a fully-electric propulsion unit with a 360-degree continuous steering capability. Its main advantage is that the unit is flush with the flat bottom of the vehicle. This makes the PJM suitable for operation in extremely shallow waters because the risk of damaging the thrusting unit in case of grounding is very limited. The PJM was produced using innovative materials, and the hydraulic components were all constructed using a 3D printer.",

      "abstract": "The study of ship underwater radiated noise is nowadays a topic of great and largely recognized importance. This is due to the fact that in the last decades, the problem of the impact of anthropogenic noise on marine life has been addressed with higher emphasis, giving rise to different efforts aimed to the analysis of its effects on different organisms and, in parallel, to means for the reduction of shipping noise. In this context, attention is focused on the propeller noise, which, in cavitating conditions, may represent the most important noise source of the ship. The propeller noise has been studied for long time with different approaches. One of the most effective approaches is represented by model scale testing in cavitation tunnels or similar facilities. Despite having been adopted for several years, radiated noise experiments in model scale are usually affected by significant scale effects and technical issues. One of these aspects is represented by the correct modelling of the propeller inflow; different techniques are adopted, depending on the facility, in order to reproduce a certain target wake. One of the main problems is to define this target wake, which should in principle coincide with the ship wake; as it is well known, it is usually derived from model scale towing tank measurements, with the necessity for the prediction of the full-scale wake field. Starting from the outcomes of a previous work on the influence of different approaches for the prediction of the full-scale wake field for a single screw ship, in this work, attention is focused on the case of a fast twin screw vessel, analysing the different issues which may be connected to this hull form.",

      "abstract": "Correct evaluation of rudder performance is a key issue in assessing ship maneuverability. This paper presents a simplified approach based on a viscous flow solver to address propeller and rudder interactions. Viscous flow solvers have been applied to this type of problems, but the large computational requests limit (or even prevent) their application at a preliminary ship design stage. Based on this idea, a simplified approach to include the propeller effect in front of the rudder is considered to speed up the solution. Based on the concept of body forces, this approach enables sufficiently fast computation for a preliminary ship design stage, thereby maintaining its reliability. To define the limitations of the proposed procedure, an extensive analysis of the simplified method is performed and the results are compared with experimental data presented in the literature. Initially, the reported results show the capability of the body-force approach to represent the inflow field to the rudder without the full description of the propeller, also with regard to the complex bollard pull condition. Consequently, the rudder forces are satisfactorily predicted at least with regard to the lift force. However, the drag force evaluation is more problematic and causes higher discrepancies. Nevertheless, these discrepancies may be accepted due to their lower influence on the overall ship maneuverability performance.",

      "abstract": "Experimental tests in model-scale are the currently established (and more reliable) methods for the propeller acoustic characterization. However, they are affected by uncertainties mostly due to scale effects, which make it difficult to consistently reproduce in model-scale some of full-scale functioning conditions. In order to cope with this issue, it is interesting to define empirical formulations to shape the most significant cavitating phenomena in terms of underwater radiated noise spectrum. A suitable approach for the determination of such formulations may consist in the experimental characterization of model propellers collecting a large amount of data such to accurately describe propeller functioning conditions and related noise emissions. Collected data should be then analysed to extrapolate desired formulations exploiting advanced data analysis techniques. In the present work the acoustical characterization of two propellers, performed at the University of Genoa cavitation tunnel, is presented. The collected sample includes cavitation buckets with inception points of different phenomena, noise spectra, pressure pulses and photos picked up at various pitches and functioning points, including off design conditions.",

They are essential ecosystems for human life. Various international conventions, directives and projects work on their protection that can help fighting the disasters resulting also from climate change. However, the acquisition and monitoring of environmental parameters in these areas is often difficult and ineffective. Classical vehicles (boats or wheeled vehicles) are not adequate in these areas and sometimes they are inaccessible or dangerous to human beings (critical or extreme environments). The development and the exploitation of innovative unmanned technologies can make surveys faster, more efficient and precise. Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs) can work over extended periods of time and less staffing is required thanks to the high level of autonomy. In this paper, several technological solutions are explored and a modular and portable ASV with an innovative propulsion system suitable for working in shallow water is described.",

      "abstract": "Classic hydrodynamics-related ship design problems can nowadays be approached by CFD viscous solvers. Ship self-propulsion performance prediction represents one of the most interesting problems in this framework. The capabilities of CFD codes to resolve accurately the separate problems (open water propeller performance and hull resistance) have been demonstrated over the last decades. The complexity of the combined problem (and, in turn, the required computational time) has restricted its solution to research applications still far from everyday industrial practice. Some approaches have been developed to reduce the computational burden, based e.g. on simple actuator-disk theory or, recently, on BEM/RANS coupled solvers. In this respect, different approaches exploiting the open-source solver Open-FOAM are presented, focusing on the main self-propulsion parameters. In addition, a new numerical strategy able to provide more information compared to classical simplified approaches, is herein presented and validated against experimental measurements on the well-known Kriso Container Ship (KCS) test case.",

      "abstract": "The manoeuvring capabilities of an escort tug are essential key-features with a view to an all-around design approach devoted to an optimum oriented framework. From the hull geometry settlement and propulsive solution definition, the ability to predict thoroughly the operative life in terms of handling, effectiveness, and safety becomes fundamental, even more with the perspective of developing smart control logics supporting the masters. With such an aim, the availability of a reliable manoeuvrability model is of fundamental importance. In this context, it is important to define an optimum set of captive manoeuvrability tests, whether experimental or numerical, in order to correctly identify the vessel escort performances in simulation; this, always keeping in mind the necessity to limit the effort in view of an application at an early-design stage. Starting from a wide experimental matrix, purposely designed and realized, the present investigation focuses on the quality and robustness of the different regression manoeuvrability models by letting vary the subsets of tests, in order to determine, finally, which is the most suitable hull model to be adopted and which is the minimum set to be performed.",

      "abstract": "The aim of the paper is to describe an industrial-academic collaboration whose main goal is the design of a new escort tug family characterized by high intact/damage stability margins, good maneuvering capability and stable behavior during escort indirect assistance. The project addresses three main research areas: hydrodynamic design of the hull with escort capability, simulation of the escort capabilities in different operational scenario, development of control logics that will allow autonomous or unmanned operations. The paper describes the methodological approach adopted for the design and will show some preliminary results. The results refer to the first part of the project. CFD calculations and towing tank tests have been performed onto a prototype tug hull in order to assess the hull design and to infer simulation models able to describe the behavior of a family of vessels. In particular, the propulsion and maneuverability aspects in escort operations are deeply investigated. Results of the project will form the bases for the conceptual application to a remotely controlled or autonomous escort tug.",

      "abstract": "Marine propellers design requirements are always more pressing and the application of unusual propulsive configurations, like ducted propellers with decelerating nozzles, may represent a valuable alternative to fulfill stringent design constraints. Accelerating duct configurations were realized mainly to increase the propeller efficiency in the case of highly-loaded functioning. The use of decelerating nozzles sustains the postponing of the cavitating phenomena that, in turn, reflects into a reduction of vibrations and radiated noise. The design of decelerating nozzle, unfortunately, is still challenging. The complex interaction between the propeller and the nozzle, both in terms of global flow feature and local (tip located) phenomena, is not yet fully understood. No extensive systematic series, as in the case of accelerating configurations, are available and the design still relies on few measurements and data. On the other hand, viscous flow solvers appear as reliable and accurate tools for the prediction of complex flow fields and their application for the calculation of ducted propeller performance and nozzle flow was almost successful. Hence, using CFD as a part of a design procedure based on optimization, by combining a parametric description of the geometry, a RANSE solver (OpenFOAM) and a genetic type algorithm (the modeFrontier optimization environment), is the obvious step towards an even more reliable ducted propeller design. An actuator disk model is adopted to include efficiently the influence of the propeller on the flow around the duct; this allows avoiding the weighting of the computational effort that is necessary for the calculations of the thousands of geometries needed for the indirect design by optimization. Design improvements, in model scale, are measured by comparing, by means of dedicated fully resolved RANSE calculations, the performance of the optimized geometries with those of conventional shapes available in literature. For both nozzle typologies, dedicated shapes reducing the risk of cavitation and increasing the delivered thrust are obtained, showing the opportunity of customized nozzle design out of usual systematic series. In addition, by analyzing the results of the optimization histories, appropriate design criteria are derived for both accelerating and decelerating nozzle shapes.",

      "abstract": "The interference between the hull, propeller and rudder remarkably affects the control and maneuvering capabilities of marine vehicles. In case of twin screw/twin rudder ships, the asymmetric evolution of the wake past the hull causes the asymmetric functioning of the propeller–rudder system. Systematic investigations on this aspect for twin screw ships are limited. Available experimental data carried out on simplified hull–propeller–rudder system and captive model tests do not allow to completely understand the fluid mechanism at the basis of the hydrodynamic interaction that should be taken into account in simplified maneuvering mathematical models for preliminary predictions. In this paper the hull–propeller–rudder interactions phenomena for a twin screw/twin rudder model are investigated by URANS simulations, with a particular focus on the asymmetry of the propeller–rudder system. To this aim, captive model tests consisting of pure rudder and coupled drift–yaw motions corresponding to the steady phases of turning circle maneuvers at different rudder angles (δ=15°÷35°) are performed at the speed correspondent to Fr=0.265. Moreover, a free running maneuvering simulation is also performed to gain more insight on the transient phase of the maneuver. An identity rudder lift methodology is applied to synthesize the hull–propeller–rudder interactions by means of a flow straightening coefficient; the analysis highlights that these effects are weak and invariant with respect to the rudder angle on the windward shaft, whereas on the leeward side these effects are extremely sensitive to the evolution of the hull and propeller wake.",

      "abstract": "The paper deals with the self-propulsion problem, i.e. the solution of the flow around the hull that advances at uniform speed due to the action of its own propeller. A coupled BEM/RANS approach, previously proposed for a simpler case with only rudder and propeller, has been extensively analysed to highlight the strength and the weakness of the method. The proposed analyses consider the influence of different turbulence modelling, the role of the interpolating algorithm for the inclusion of body forces into the RANS domain, a mesh and simulation time step sensitivity study and the influence of the extrapolation procedure for the definition of the effective wake to the propeller in the light of the lightest and the most affordable computational setup for daily accurate calculations. At first, the well-known Kriso Container Ship (KCS) test case is considered. This ship has been widely investigated in the context of different research projects and a large amount of data (both measurements and numerical calculations) is available to validate the solution approach and to highlight the benefits, as well as the weaknesses, of the proposed coupled BEM/RANS approach versus established but computationally demanding calculations based only on RANS simulations. Once the approach has been developed and validated via the KCS test case, calculations have been repeated in the case of completely different ships, in order to evaluate its general applicability and to test the robustness and the reliability of the proposed procedure.",

      "abstract": "A growing attention has been recently devoted to the impact of the underwater noise field generated by shipping activities on the marine fauna. A key aspect for the quantification of such impact is a proper model of the source levels radiated from the vessels. At a first level of approximation, simplified formulations based on a small number of macroparameters describing the ship characteristics are needed to quantify the emission and, accordingly, assess the noise impact and evaluate strategies for its control. In fact, a few models of this kind are available in the literature, mainly based on measurements and databases developed for military purposes. Most of these models have been tuned on old ships: this poses the question whether they are still applicable to modern commercial vessels. In this work, spectra of a series of measurements of underwater noise emitted by commercial vessels measured in the framework of two EU FP7 projects (SILENV: www.silenv.eu and AQUO: www.aquo.eu) are analyzed and compared with the results obtained applying the available literature models. The analysis is carried out for noise emitted both at design and off-design conditions. In such conditions, the models are also compared with a proposed spectral parametrization. Focusing on the off-design conditions, a detailed narrow band analysis of a complete set of noise spectra is presented for a ship equipped with a controllable pitch propeller (CPP). The spectral peculiarities of such a propulsion plant, when operated at constant revolutions per minute (RPM) are highlighted. Results of the suggested parametrization applied to the same ship are presented together with the data of other CPP ships and a critical analysis is carried out discussing the limits of the existing predictive models.",

      "abstract": "The design of a propeller for a high-speed craft is addressed by using a multi-objective numerical optimization approach. By combining a fast and reliable Boundary Elements Method (BEM), a viscous flow solver based on the RANSE approximation, a parametric 3D description of the blade and a genetic algorithm, the new propeller shape is designed to improve the propulsive efficiency, reduce the cavitation extension, increase the cavitation inception speed and maximize, at the same time, the ship speed. Rather than by constraining the propeller delivered thrust, indeed, the proposed procedure works together with an engine-propeller matching algorithm that, each time a new propeller is defined, identifies the achievable maximum ship speed and the resulting engine functioning point that turn in additional goals for the multi-objective optimization. A set of optimal propellers, obtained through the design by optimization based on potential flow calculations (via the Boundary Elements Method), are selected for additional viscous analyses (RANSE calculations) in order to further validate the results of the BEM calculations and provide a deeper insight into the complex flow fields of high speed propellers. Among this subset of optimal configurations, a final geometry is selected to verify the reliability of the design procedure by means of dedicated cavitation tunnel tests and full-scale measurements on a high-speed craft provided by Azimut|Benetti.",

      "abstract": "The state of the art of fast propeller design codes is mainly based on classical vortical theories by Lerbs. Their crude simplifications make them often insufficiently accurate in the case of modern fast propellers geometries having highly skewed blades, non-conventional profiles, mixed type of cavitation and strict constraints about pressure pulses and radiated noise. Advanced design tools, based on (more) accurate flow solvers able to deal with the multi-objective nature of any modern design are, definitely, required. In light of this, the design of a propeller for a high-speed craft is addressed by using a multi-objective numerical optimization approach, based on a fast and reliable BEM, a parametric description of the geometry and a genetic algorithm.

      "abstract": "Marine propellers design requirements are always more pressing and the application of unusual propulsive configurations, like ducted propellers with decelerating nozzles, may represent a valuable alternative to fulfil stringent design constraints. If accelerating duct configurations were realized mainly to increase the propeller efficiency in highly-loaded conditions, decelerating nozzles sustains the postponing of the cavitating phenomena that reflects into reduction of vibrations and radiated noise. The design of decelerating nozzle, unfortunately, is still challenging. No extensive systematic series are available and the design relies on few measurements. On the other hand, viscous flow solvers appear as reliable and accurate tools for the prediction of complex flow fields. Hence, in the present paper the opportunity to use CFD as a part of a design procedure based on optimization, by combining a parametric description of the geometry, the OpenFOAM solver and a genetic type algorithm in the ModeFrontier environment, is investigated. Design improvements for both accelerating and decelerating ducts are measured by comparing the performance of the optimized geometries with those of conventional shapes available in literature.",

      "abstract": "The increase in marine transportation in the last decades has resulted in a rise of the different emissions linked to it. Amongst various detrimental emissions of shipping activities, underwater noise is known to affect ambient noise levels and hence threaten the life (or even survivability) of marine mammals. This concern brought the underwater radiated noise (URN) to the attention of regulators, considering the possible need to limits for commercial ships, thus resulting in a surge of interest. As being the main contributor to the URN of ships, the accurate prediction of propeller cavitation and hence associated noise in the design stage is crucial for achieving reductions in terms of emitted sound pressure levels. Whilst computational methods are developing at an exponential pace and so are prospective tools for the future, model scale experiments still represent the most reliable and largely adopted approach for the prediction of propeller radiated noise. Despite the importance of model tests, being the only reliable tool for cavitation noise prediction, a benchmark data is non-existent for facilities all over the world to compare and correlate their noise measurements. Within this framework, this paper presents the first comparison of a round robin test campaign amongst the Noise CoP (Community of Practice) of Hydro Testing Forum (HTF). Based on the extensive experiments conducted first at Emerson Cavitation Tunnel (ECT), a reduced test matrix is proposed to the forum members. University of Genoa (UNIGE) is the first member to complete the tests specified in the reduced matrix and this paper presents comparisons between the test results of ECT and UNIGE cavitation tunnel in terms of measured sound pressure levels, propeller open water performance, cavitation observations and cavitation inception characteristics. Moreover, in order to shed a light on the issue of propeller cavitation noise measurements, a series of investigations are carried out by UNIGE scrutinizing the effect of hydrophone position, oxygen content, propeller shaft revolution rate, sensitivity to thrust coefficient and cavitation number.",

      "abstract": "The present paper is focused on an experimental investigation of pressure pulses and radiated noise for two alternative designs of a propeller of a high-speed craft. The propellers have been designed in the context of a research project starting from two different rake distributions (forward rake to increase thrust and efficiency, backward rake to reduce cavitation), using different techniques (traditional lifting line / lifting surface and optimization algorithm coupled with a panel code), leading thus to rather different geometries. Propellers have been tested through cavitation tunnel experiments. The activity represents an interesting case study for this kind of measurement in presence of rather large cavitation extensions. The effects of cavitation on different components of pressure pulses and noise are investigated for the different rake distributions adopted. Results clearly shows the effects of this geometrical characteristic on cavitation and pressure pulses pointing out that, in some cases, propeller hydrodynamic performances may determine pressure pulses intensity more than cavitation extensions. A simplified numerical approach, adopting stationary RANS calculations, for the evaluation of the effects of propeller geometry, has been proposed. Results show a good correlation with measurements allowing to have an insight into the phenomenon and confirming the effect of the rake.",

      "abstract": "Traditionally, propeller design has been focused on all activities necessary to obtain a propeller featuring a high efficiency, avoiding erosive cavitation for given operating conditions and having adequate structural strength. In recent years, more and more challenging requirements have been imposed, such as the reduction of radiated noise and pressures pulses, requiring more precise analyses and methods in the optimization of the propeller performance. On the other hand, the evaluation of the propeller strength still relies on simplified methods, which basically consider the blade as a cantilever beam subjected to characteristic static forces. Since the loads acting on a blade are variable in the blade revolution and in different operating conditions throughout the ship life, a procedure to account for the influence of fatigue phenomena is proposed. The fatigue assessment could reduce the safety factor in the propeller scantling rules and allow improving the quality of propeller design (e.g. obtaining higher efficiency, margin on cavitation phenomena, less noise).",

This is due to different phenomena, among which scale effects on cavitation and ship wake, confined environment and near field effects in model tests play an important role; the analysis of these problems is made difficult by the rather limited amount of available data from sea trials and to the complexities of the phenomena, most of which related to cavitation on the propeller blades, that are present in the measurements carried out in cavitation tunnels, depressurized towing tanks or circulating channels. In the present work, the subject has been studied with reference to a four blades conventional CP propeller of a coastal tanker. Cavitation tunnel tests have been carried out in two rather different facilities, at UNIGE cavitation tunnel and at SSPA large cavitation tunnel. Results from model scale tests processed with different treatments are then compared with full scale measurements performed by SSPA on the same propeller in terms of cavitation extension and radiated noise. The analysis is aimed at assessing the effectiveness of different experimental setups, testing procedures and scaling laws.",

      "abstract": "When dealing with towing and Escort operations—indissolubly—a wider and complete modelling of the involved dynamics becomes fundamental, on both ship and tug side, even more so making unavoidable the need of correctly ponder the cables constraining coupling. With the aim to better understand the peculiarities of tug-ship interaction, a 6-DOF time domain simulator comprehensive of the propulsion dynamics has been developed, across the inter-connection imposed by the towing-line. Particular attention is focused on discovering the operational capabilities of the tug in exerting a force on the assisted ship during Escort, and the subsequent great influence that the reaction makes on the tug handling and effectiveness. A conceptual and critical discussion stands out, preparing the ground to future design strategies and hinting different solutions to be investigated, directly facing the operative profile of the vessel.",

      "abstract": "The present paper deals with the side effects of propellers cavitation, i.e. pressure pulses and radiated noise. These effects are gaining more and more importance for commercial ships for different reasons. Pressure pulses significantly affect comfort onboard, thus their reduction is of utmost importance for all ships carrying passengers. As regards the underwater radiated noise, in the last decade interest has shifted from navy applications to commercial ships, due to the concern for the rising background noise in the oceans. The propellers, generating noise directly in water, represent one of the main contributions to the overall underwater noise emitted from ships. Due to the complexity of the mechanisms of propeller noise generation, different complementary strategies have to be followed to properly analyze the problem, ranging from induced pressure pulses to broadband noise and cavitation. In the present work, part of the activities carried out in the framework of the collaborative EU FP7 project AQUO (Achieve QUieter Oceans by shipping noise footprint reduction, www.aquo.eu) are reported. The paper presents the investigations carried out on a specific test case represented by a single screw research vessel, which is analyzed with three different strategies: numerical calculations, model scale investigations and full-scale measurements.",

      "abstract": "A comprehensive approach to modelling and simulation of high speed craft dynamics during turning circle and zig-zag manoeuvres is presented in this paper. The high performance requirements for propulsion systems and the increasing attention being paid to planing hull manoeuvring features suggest the need for a thorough investigation into ship dynamics, starting in the preliminary design phase. Dynamic aspects of planing craft during manoeuvres cannot be adequately dealt with by traditional methodologies and purely steady state approaches. For this reason, the boat's dynamic behaviour is evaluated by means of a time domain simulator, able to represent the hull dynamics, including the mutual interactions with the propulsion system and propulsion controller. Manoeuvrability characteristics are simulated on the basis of captive model tests on planing hulls available in open literature. Compared with previous similar studies, in the present work a possible strategy is introduced to represent roll motion due to the propulsion and steering effects. Finally, the simulation results are compared with sea trial records in order to highlight the capabilities and shortcomings of the proposed method. The case study analysed is a boat equipped with two azimuthal propulsors driven by two highspeed diesel engines that ensure a speed up to 32.5 kn.",

      "abstract": "A statistical analysis of noise can play an important role in evaluating the performances of an acoustic system working underwater. If the system is either placed on board a vessel or operates nearby passing ships, the noise radiated by the vessel can considerably reduce the performances of the system if it has been not designed to have enough robustness. In the paper, a statistical analysis of ship noise records measured at sea is presented. Noise data were recorded in the framework of the EU FP7 European project AQUO (Achieve QUieter Oceans by shipping noise footprint reduction). Aim of the analysis is to characterize the ship noise in terms of probability distributions and their high-order moments. Since the overall ship noise is known to be generated by a number of sources with peculiar spectral energy distributions, the vessel spectrum can change considerably with a variation in the operating conditions. This approach allows determining the dependence of ship noise statistical properties on the actual navigation condition. In addition, since the ship noise records were simultaneously recorded by a vertical array of three hydrophones, a further analysis has been carried out to determine the effect of the receiver depth, and, accordingly, of the propagation path, in the recorded signal.",

      "abstract": "Unfavorable wake and separated flow from the hull might cause a dramatic decay of the propeller performance in single-screw propelled vessels such as tankers, bulk carriers and containers. For these types of vessels, special attention has to be paid to the design of the stern region, the occurrence of a good flow towards the propeller and rudder being necessary to minimize fuel consumption and avoid excessive vibratory shaft loads and risk for cavitation erosion. The present work deals with the analysis of the propeller inflow in a single-screw chemical tanker vessel affected by massive flow separation in the stern region. Detailed flow measurements by Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) were performed in the propeller region at model scale, in the large Circulating Water Channel of CNR-INSEAN. These tests were undertaken with and without the propeller in order to investigate its effect on the inflow characteristics and the separation mechanisms. In this context, the study also concerned a phase locked analysis of the propeller perturbation at different distances upstream of the propulsor. The study shows the effectiveness of the 3rd order statistical moment (i.e., skewness) for describing the topology of the wake and accurately identifying the portion affected by the detached flow. The skewness coefficient also suggests that a better physical representation of the propeller inflow is provided by the mode value of the velocity, which is the maximum of the probability density function, rather than the mean velocity.",

      "abstract": "The continuous development of design tools and analysis procedures has allowed propeller performances to increase progressively during years following more and more stringent design requirements. High propeller efficiency and avoidance of erosive cavitation are considered nowadays basic requests for a well designed propeller. However this may not be enough to meet the requirements of high added value ships such as passengers ships, mega yachts, research vessels, naval vessels etc. These kinds of ship need a propulsion system not only with good efficiency but also with low levels of vibrations and noise transmitted inside the ship and with low underwater radiated noise. Moreover, the above mentioned ships often work in a rather wide range of operational condition. Actually, the possibility to operate at reduced speed regards almost all kinds of ships, due to the increasing attention to fuel consumption and exhaust gas emissions, and the related tendency towards slow steaming. Speed reduction may be obtained in different ways. In the case of ships equipped with CPPs, in principle it may be achieved reducing RPM at constant pitch or reducing pitch at constant RPM; the latter is usually preferred when a power take off is present. This results in working conditions far from design ones for the propeller; Cavitation and related radiated noise may increase significantly in similar situations, despite the speed reduction is felt to be generally beneficial for the purpose. In this work, the effect of different speed reduction strategies on cavitation and radiated noise is studied by means of cavitation tunnel tests of four CPPs including both single screw and twin screw configurations.",

      "abstract": "In this work a method for estimating parameters of practical ship manoeuvring models based on the combination of RANSE computations and System Identification procedure is investigated, considering as test case a rather slender twin screw and two rudders ship. The approach consists in the estimation of the hydrodynamic coefficients applying System Identification to a set of free running manoeuvres obtained from an in-house unsteady RANS equations solver, which substitute the usually adopted experimental tests at model or full scale. In this alternative procedure the numerical quasi-trials (in terms of kinematic parameters time histories and, if needed, forces time histories) are used as input for the System Identification procedure; the aim of this approach is to reduce external disturbances that, if not properly considered in the mathematical model, may compromise the identification results, or at least amplify the well-known \"cancellation effects\". Furthermore, the CFD results provide information both in terms of flow field variables and hydrodynamic forces on the manoeuvring ship. These data may be adopted for a better understanding of the complex flow during manoeuvres, especially at stern, providing also additional information about the interaction between the various appendages (including rudders) and the hull. The identification procedure is based on an off-line genetic algorithm used for minimizing the discrepancy between the reference manoeuvres from CFD and those simulated with the system based modular model. The discrepancy was measured considering different metric functions and simplified formulations which consider only the main macroscopic parameters of the manoeuvre; the metrics have been analyzed in terms of their capability in reproducing the time histories and in limiting the cancellation effect of the hydrodynamic derivatives.",

      "abstract": "In the last decades problems related to ship manoeuvrability have gained more importance in the context of naval architecture. Among them, problems related to slow speed manoeuvrability, such as port manoeuvres and dynamic positioning (DP), for which less data is available with respect to the conventional manoeuvrability at cruising speed, have taken more and more importance. The classical manoeuvring models have been developed to evaluate the ship force for high forward speed and low drift angle, therefore in case of slow speed manoeuvres, where high angle of attack must be taken into account, they do not provide accurate results. Despite the lower number of studies, also in this case different models have been proposed by various authors during years. The accuracy of codes to predict the ship manoeuvring capabilities are, obviously, strongly correlated with the accuracy of the prediction of the ship hydrodynamic forces, which are computed via regression formulae based, commonly, on existing experimental data. In the case of slow speed manoeuvring, unfortunately, only few data are available, representing an issue for the prediction of ship capabilities. In the present paper at first a comparison of different empirical models to evaluate the main ship force components for slow speed manoeuvring is presented. Then a RANS approach in order to tune coefficients for low velocity models has been explored, in order to evaluate its ability to compensate the lack of experimental data and provide a suitable alternative in the design phases.",

      "abstract": "A major source of the underwater radiated noise from ships is represented by propulsion systems and by propellers in particular. The main noise-generating mechanism within ship propellers is cavitation, associated to the growing and collapse of vapour bubbles resulting from the unsteady hydrodynamic pressure field generated on the blades. The control of propeller underwater radiated noise is therefore strictly related to the control of cavitation phenomena, which are responsible for a larger part of the radiation. The activity within work package 2 of the collaborative project AQUO (Achieve QUiter Oceans by shipping noise footprint reduction, www.aquo.eu) of the 7th FP of the EU focuses on this aspect, which is analysed both from the experimental and numerical viewpoint. The present paper reports motivations, aims and achievements of such activity in the first year of the project.",

      "abstract": "The problem of the tip vortex cavitation inception is a matter of increasing interest. Main reason for this is that, despite being, generally, not erosive and not influent on the propeller mechanical characteristics, the cavitating vortex dynamics may play a significant role in the propeller radiated noise. In the present work, a thorough analysis of the capability of a commercial RANS solver in conjunction with the Schnerr-Sauer cavitation model to predict the tip and the tip leakage vortex cavitation (with particular attention to their inception) for a conventional and two ducted propellers respectively, is presented. Considering at first a conventional CP propeller, a comprehensive analysis of the effect of the various parameters (e.g. mesh characteristics, number and size of nuclei in the numerical calculations) on the computed results is reported, together with a comparison with the experimental measurements carried out in a cavitation tunnel. This analysis allows to stress the capabilities of RANS computations to correctly predict tip phenomena and to provide guidelines in order to obtain reliable numerical results, having in mind the necessity of a compromise between calculation accuracy and computational time, essential in the case of a systematic application of the presented approach for design purposes. Furthermore the calculations are repeated also for two propellers in decelerating duct and the satisfactory results obtained demonstrate the capability of the proposed approach to correctly rank two slightly different geometries also for this more complex and challenging case.",

      "abstract": "This work presents the main steps for the development of a multi-physic simulation platform, able to represent the dynamics of a twin-screw ship in 6 degrees of freedom, taking into account the complete propulsion system including automation effects. The simulation platform has to be used in the preliminary design phase in order to study and design the propulsion plant and its control system. The ship motion model has been developed including roll motion, in order to capture the ship heel angles during tight turning circles, which may be significant for a fast naval vessel. Moreover, the simulation model includes a simplified representation of the asymmetric behaviour of the two propeller shafts during manoeuvres, which cannot be neglected when dealing with the propulsion plant behaviour. Several sub-models have been developed and calibrated by means of a set of experimental tests, in model and full scale. The sea trial campaign is finally used to validate and tune the developed simulator; thus, the final version may be adopted as an optimization tool for other future designs (or sister ships) and training purposes. Although the presented case study has been validated on a specific ship, most of the discussed models have a general application.",

      "abstract": "The propeller performances and in particular the non-stationary cavitating behavior and its side effects, i.e. pressure pulses and radiated noise, are strongly dependent on the ship wake field. Many different predictive methods are available, however in many cases predictions are still performed on the basis of semi-empirical approaches, whose validity is doubtful. In parallel to this, the ever increasing power of computational tools (namely RANS solvers) allows for a direct numerical prediction of the ship full scale wake. In the present paper, the effect of the adoption of two different full scale wakes obtained with semi-empirical methods and direct computations is evaluated experimentally by means of cavitation turmel tests on a model propeller, focusing the attention not only on mechanical characteristics and cavitation extents but, specifically, on pressure pulses and radiated noise. The results of this study put into evidence the differences which may be expected using the two different scaling approaches.",

      "abstract": "In the present work an analysis of the reliability of different numerical approaches, namely BEM and RANSE solver, for the prediction of unsteady performances of marine propellers is presented. To this aim, the well-known Seiun-Maru Highly Skewed Propeller operating in different wakes is considered. The results of this analysis show that, in correspondence to particularly challenging conditions, i.e. when very pronounced ship wakes are present, the two approaches may provide considerably different results in terms of propeller mechanical characteristics and pressure distributions on the blades. This problem, which is implicitly eliminated when the thrust identity approach is applied (as almost always performed, as an example, for propeller analyses aimed to the evaluation of cavitation extension and/ or induced pressures), may become critical in case the codes are used for numerical self-propulsion tests, where a high accuracy in the prediction of the unsteady propeller performances in correspondence to a prescribed value of the advance coefficient, instead of the thrust coefficient, is mandatory. The analyses carried out allow to underline which are the potentially more problematic cases, in terms of wakes characteristics, and to suggest some possible reasons of the encountered discrepancies, which will need further analyses to enhance the prediction capability of numerical codes.",

      "abstract": "A comprehensive approach to simulate the interaction between the ship propulsion system and manoeuvrability, during transients and off design conditions, is presented. The increasing attention on the manoeuvring features of the vessel has forced designers to consider this aspect already in the preliminary stages of the project. Data about manoeuvring characteristics may be obtained by means of several model tests (at planar motion mechanism or with free running models). However, differences between model tests and full scale trials exist. From the hydrodynamic point of view, some disagreements are due to the scale effects but also the effect of the propulsion control system, highly non-linear, may provide a considerable contribution to such differences. These dynamical aspects cannot be taken into account with traditional methodologies and purely stationary approaches. For these reasons, the ship dynamic behaviour is evaluated by time domain simulators, developed by the authors, which include the ship dynamics, the propulsion plant dynamics and the propulsion control system logics. At the end of the paper some simulation results are shown in order to better understand the effects and the differences of the propulsion control settings on the ship manoeuvrability in model and full scale.",

      "abstract": "Twin screw ships may experience considerably asymmetric propeller functioning during manoeuvres. This phenomenon may result in large power fluctuations during tight manoeuvres, with increases of shaft torque up to and over 100% of the steady values in straight course and considerable unbalances; this, in its turn, may be potentially dangerous, especially in case of particularly complex propulsion plant configurations, such as those with coupled shaftlines. A joint research project supported by the Italian Navy has been set up in order to deeply investigate the phenomenon, by means of large scale model testing and related numerical simulations. In the present work, the extensive experimental campaign results on a free running model of a twin-screw ship are presented, allowing to obtain a deeper insight of the problem. In particular, tests have been carried out simulating different simplified control schemes, starting from the most common constant rate of revolution tests and including different control strategies (constant torque and power). Usual standard manoeuvres (turning circle, zigzag and spiral) have been carried out, providing results for asymmetric shaft functioning and ship manoeuvrability behaviour. Results from the present analysis allow to obtain the complete model for the time domain simulation of asymmetric shaft functioning. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

      "abstract": "The maritime traffic is the real backbone of the international transport of goods in the world and it is driven by a severe observance of time scheduling. Nevertheless, mainly in relation with the most traveled routes, frequently it might happen that port facilities are congested, and the time schedule for ship load/unload operations is accordingly delayed. In this circumstance the choice is between meeting the original ETA (estimated time of arrival) and then let the ship riding at anchor or slowing down the ship in order to adjust the arrival to the actually needed time window. The latter option is called \"Virtual Arrival\"[l] because it consists of applying a speed reduction that fits the new time for port operations instead of arriving at the original ETA. The purpose of this paper is to investigate to what extent the Virtual Arrival policy could be a valuable option providing a reasonable energy saving for ships. The potential benefits are considerable and they result in direct saving in fuel consumption, reduction of C02 emissions and less congested port areas. © 2013: The Royal Institution of Naval Architects.",

Such a testing facility makes possible the fluodynamic and acoustic characterization of in scale models of naval propellers. To get significant data it is mandatory for the acquisitions that the test facility operates in optimal conditions, limiting as much as possible any type of emission of noise not associated to the propeller under test. Recently, noise originating from the driveline requested an investigation on its causes to locate the elements constituting its source. To identify and to characterize the failure, both microphonic and accelerometric measurements were performed. With reference to the first typology of measurements, an acoustic mapping in three dimensions was adopted, making possible to locate the mostly critical driveline zones and to individuate the possible components having an anomalous operation present in the driveline. In addition, in the same time accelerometric measurements have been done to acquire structural information on the driveline itself. The correlation between the vibrational data and the acoustic ones made possible to obtain additional elements useful to complete the diagnostic study on the system.",

      "abstract": "The paper is focused on some benefits gained by the integration of CFD results into the simulation process over time, in order to develop a whole numerical model representing the dynamics of a large merchant ship during towing/escorting operations in severe weather conditions. In particular, the shown application is referred to the simulation of a container ship, towed by two tugboats in a typical Mediterranean harbor. The developed simulator consists of a set of ordinary differential equations, mathematical relationships and numerical tables which represent the ship and the propulsion system dynamics, while CFD method is used in order to model the wind forces, eventually influenced by the presence of some harbor breakwaters, acting on the considered ship. The proposed simulator can be used as a powerful tool to plan safer towing arrangements and procedures, or to analyze in post-processing possible human errors in the case of unfortunate marine accidents. © 2013 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.",

The present work, based on a PhD project [1], reports an overview of existing literature on the topic, focussing then on the Lewandowski methodology assessing the dynamic stability of hard chine monohulls; such methodology has been applied to selected hulls belonging to Series 62, in order to assess the sensitivity of the numerical tool and the influence of various geometrical parameters. Moreover, a comparison between dynamic stability results and existing stability regulations, allowed some possible guidelines to be developed for the preliminary design phase in order to avoid transverse stability problems. The study clearly indicates the need for further studies in order to enhance the applied methodology. To this aim, extensive experimental investigations are deemed essential. © 2012 The Royal Institution of Naval Architects.",

      "abstract": "Ducted propellers, in decelerating duct configuration, may represent a possible solution for the designer to reduce cavitation and its side effects, that is, induced pressures and radiated noise; however, their design still presents challenges, due to the complex evaluation of the decelerating duct effects and to the limited amount of available experimental information. In the present paper, a hybrid design approach, adopting a coupled lifting line/panel method solver and a successive refinement with panel solver and optimization techniques, is presented. In order to validate this procedure and provide information about these propulsors, experimental results at towing tank and cavitation tunnel are compared with numerical predictions. Moreover, additional results obtained by means of a commercial RANS solver, not directly adopted in the design loop, are also presented, allowing to stress the relative merits and shortcomings of the different numerical approaches. © 2012 Stefano Gaggero et al.",

Investigation was carried out first by Finite Element Method (FEM) Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) approach, considering the structure as rigid wall. Thereafter, fluid structure interaction (FSI) model using finite element method for both fluid and structural degrees of freedom was implemented. Typical test cases were considered, for which experimental results were available in open literature and already compared with other CFD results in previous works. Comparisons are widely discussed and hints are reported about assumptions and practical issues making such analyses very challenging.

      "abstract": "In the present paper an experimental and numerical analysis of an unconventional CLT propeller is carried out. Two different numerical approaches, a potential panel method and an RANSE solver, are employed. Cavitation tunnel experiments are carried out in order to measure, as usual, thrust, torque, and cavity extension for different propeller working points. Moreover, LDV measurements are performed to have a deep insight into the complex wake behind the propeller and to analyze the dynamics of generated tip vortexes. The numerical/experimental analysis and comparison of results highlight the peculiarities of this kind of propellers, the possibility to increase efficiency and reduce cavitation risk, in order to exploit the design approaches already well proven for conventional propellers also in the case of these unconventional geometries.

      "abstract": "Simplified mathematical models based upon semi-empirical regression formulae describing forces and moments acting on the hull during manoeuvres are commonly used for the preliminary evaluation of ship steering capabilities. Many semi-empirical regressions have been developed, and are broadly adopted, for the manoeuvrability prediction of single screw slow/medium speed ships. Their application for the study of twin screw vessels (cruise ships, RoRo ferries, megayachts, naval vessels, for which dedicated regression formulae are scarce) manoeuvring capabilities could lead to misleading results. These ships are usually characterised by different hull forms and more complex stern configuration due to the presence of appendages like skegs, shaft lines and brackets, which can strongly affect manoeuvrability behaviour. In this work a novel procedure to properly account for the particular geometric and stern appendage characteristics of these kind of vessels is described. A thorough analysis has been performed on a ship model equipped with 13 different stern appendage configurations and new formulae have been developed in order to describe accurately their influence on ship manoeuvring behaviour. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

      "abstract": "Sloshing describes the movement of liquids inside partially filled tanks, generating dynamic loads on the tank structure. The resulting impact pressures are of great importance in assessing structural strength, and their correct evaluation still represents a challenge for the designer due to the high level of nonlinearities involved, with complex free surface deformations, violent impact phenomena and influence of air trapping. In the present paper, a set of two-dimensional cases, for which experimental results are available, is considered to assess the merits and shortcomings of different numerical methods for sloshing evaluation, namely two commercial RANS solvers (FLOW-3D and LS-DYNA), and two academic software (Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics and RANS). Impact pressures at various critical locations and global moment induced by water motion in a partially filled rectangular tank, subject to a simple harmonic rolling motion, are evaluated and predictions are compared with experimental measurements.© 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

      "abstract": "Propeller design requirements are nowadays more and more stringent, demanding not only to provide high efficiency and to avoid cavitation, but including also requirements in terms of low induced vibrations and radiated noise. Ducted propellers may provide the opportunity to reduce these negative effects or to increase the efficiency of heavily loaded propellers. This paper presents the development of a measuring device for the cavitation tunnel, in order to evaluate the forces on the duct. The measurement tool was designed and realized in house and it is at the same time the support of the duct to be placed in the cavitation tunnel and the device measuring the acting forces. By means of the developed measuring device, two ducted propellers with different characteristics (namely with accelerating and decelerating duct) have been tested at cavitation tunnel. The results of these two test series were compared with towing tank open water test data, showing a good agreement. Moreover, cavitation tests were also carried out, focusing the attention on the phenomena on the duct and on other interesting characteristics, such as thrust breakdown, providing useful data for future validations of numerical propeller design and analysis tool.",

Moreover, in some cases propeller characteristics have to be optimized in correspondence to very different functioning points, including considerably off-design conditions, which are hardly captured by conventional design methods. In present paper, a recently presented method, based on the coupling between a multiobjective optimization algorithm and a panel code, is applied to the design of a CP propeller at different pitch settings, with the aim of reducing cavitating phenomena and, consequently, resultant radiated noise. Numerical results are validated by means of an experimental campaign at cavitation tunnel, showing the capability of the method to assess propeller functioning characteristics, thus representing a very useful tool for the designer in correspondence of challenging problems.",

      "abstract": "Twin screw vessels' propulsion system experiences strong off design conditions during tight manoeuvres due to the propellers inflow asymmetry arising from the coupled yaw-drift motion. Unfortunately, simplified mathematical models based upon statistical data or ad hoc executed captive model test (PMM or CMT) do not provide such a detailed information. Indeed, free running model tests are the best mean in order to get ship's trajectory and kinematics parameters data and propulsion behaviour by recording the loads (thrust and torque) on the shafts. More insight into this complex aspect is desired in order to improve and generalize the application of existing manoeuvring mathematical models for the preliminary design of unconventional propulsive configuration control system.

A study about the automatic optimization of the fore hull forms of a fast frigate has been carried out. On the basis of a technical specification provided by the Italian Navy, the initial shape of the hull has been defined by means of an accurate preliminary design leading to a set of geometrical constraints for the optimization process. The fully automatic optimization chain has been implemented adopting the ModeFrontier optimization environment to interface the Friendship-Framework (parametric definition of the hull shape), the CFD codes developed by CETENA S.p.A. (to predict the steady wave resistance and unsteady seakeeping performances of each design candidate), and a MOGA genetic algorithm. Numerical results have been validated by means of calm water model tests performed at the Towing Tank of the Department of Naval Architecture and Electrical Engineering (DINAEL) of the University of Genoa. Notwithstanding the rather high number of constraints, which limit geometry variations, it was possible to obtain an optimal solution, and results have been confirmed by the experimental tests.",

The behaviour of the ship systems is simulated by means of a numerical model, developed by the authors, which includes the ship dynamics (3 D.O.F. model), the propulsion plant dynamics and the control system dynamics. The presented approach was successfully used for the design of the Italian Aircraft Carrier 'Cavour'. The application presented in this paper concerns the design of the propulsion control system of the new Italian Frigates FREMM. This class of ships has a new propulsion plant concept: the COmbined Diesel eLectric And Gas (CODLAG) type, with single gear and two shaft lines. With respect to the previous applications, the new model is able to capture the unbalance of the shaft lines during a turning manoeuvre. This feature is used to develop a control system able to limit the undesirable consequences of this effect on the shaft line components. © 2010: The Royal Institution of Naval Architects.",

In particular, numerical simulations were conducted on a wedge-shaped section with 30° deadrise and on a ship bow section; in both cases, different heel angles and different drop speeds have been considered, to analyse a wide range of cases and to assess not only the accuracy of the numerical methods in a single case, but also their capability to capture significantly different conditions.

      "abstract": "Leisure boats market has constantly grown during the latest years entailing an increasing need of design tools, dealing with technical problems like seakeeping of planing boats, whose complexity still present a high challenge for designers. The present paper describes a methodology for the calculation in time domain of the vertical motions of a planing boat in head waves, capable of predicting the non-linear vertical motions of the boat in both regular / irregular head waves. The formulation makes recourse to a 'strip-theory' approach to get the 3D hydrodynamic forces as a linear superposition of the sectional forces. The determination of the 2D planing forces is based on 'momentum theory' using Wagner's wedge-theory to model the sectional characteristics, while non-linear Froude-Krylov forces are directly evaluated accounting the relative motions at each cross-section. Moreover, from the time-series of the vertical motions an overall passenger comfort index and slamming pressures are evaluated. A validation of the code is presented against the model-test results available in literature.",

This seems particularly urgent for seakeeping and hydrodynamic performance prediction in the field of planing boats. Numerical methodologies are almost consolidated instruments for conventional displacement ships, while some shortcomings are still to be faced and overcome concerning planing craft, due to the high complexity of the hydrodynamic problem. The present paper describes a simplified methodology for the prediction of pitch, heave and roll motions of a planing boat, in regular and irregular waves. In the formulation, a 2D approach is adopted, based on 'momentum theory'; various aspects of the wedge-theory are used in order to model the sectional characteristics, with particular attention to the added mass.

      "abstract": "The present paper deals with a methodology for the prediction of propellers excitation and associated ship response. A simple ellipsoidal representation of submerged and floating bodies has been used first to understand how hull pressure distributions are affected by the location and frequency of propeller sources. Then, the analysis of a ship, a twin-screw cruise liner, has been addressed and semi-empirical methods have been used to give a characterization of propellers in terms of acoustic source strength, in the frequency range between 1 and 50Hz. Both the ellipsoid and the ship have been analyzed as rigid as well as elastic bodies. In the first case a direct-BEM (boundary element method) analysis has been carried out, whereas in the second case a coupled direct-BEM/structural FEM (finite element method) has been conducted taking into account the dynamic response of the structure. It is worth pointing out that the investigated frequencies range was limited to 50Hz by the definition of the adopted FEM mesh and the forthcoming continuation of the study includes the extension to the limit of 80Hz, indicated by the ISO 6954:2000 standards. © 2008 by the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven Department of Mechanical Engineering All rights reserved.",

After a brief introduction, where the state-of-the-art is described, a few theoretical issues are discussed, and short description of the research and design work is presented. The results of various other tests performed with PSPs both with models and in full scale are also illustrated and briefly discussed; these have then been compared with results obtainable from conventional propeller installations, Risks of possible undesired phenomena and benefits related to the application of large scale PSPs on displacing ships of different types and sizes are also dealt with, and an overview of investigations recently carried out on a particular application of a PSP is illustrated.",
