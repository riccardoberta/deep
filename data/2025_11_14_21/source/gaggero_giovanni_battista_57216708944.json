      "abstract": "Energy communities consist of decentralized energy production, storage, consumption, and distribution and are gaining traction in modern power systems. However, these communities may increase the vulnerability of the grid to cyber threats. We propose an anomaly-based intrusion detection system to enhance the security of energy communities. The system leverages LSTM autoencoders to detect deviations from normal operational patterns in order to identify anomalies induced by attacks or faults. Operational data for training and evaluation are derived from a Simulink-based model of an energy community. The results show that the autoencoder-based intrusion detection system achieves good detection performance across multiple attack scenarios, up to 0.9270 and 0.9735 in precision and recall respectively. We also demonstrate potential for real-world application of the system by training a federated model that enables distributed intrusion detection while preserving data privacy.",

Vulnerabilities in Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications, especially along highways, pose significant risks, such as unauthorized interception or alteration of vehicle data. This study proposes a Software-Defined Radio (SDR)-based tool designed to assess the protection level of V2X communication systems against cyber attacks. The proposed tool can emulate both reception and transmission of IEEE 802.11p packets while testing DSRC implementation and robustness. The results of this investigation offer valuable contributions toward shaping cybersecurity strategies and frameworks designed to protect the integrity of Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communications.",

      "abstract": "Modern photovoltaic (PV) systems face increasing cybersecurity threats due to their integration with smart grid infrastructure. While previous research has identified vulnerabilities, the lack of standardized datasets has hindered the development and evaluation of detection algorithms. Building upon our previously introduced Photo-Set dataset, this paper presents a benchmark evaluation of anomaly detection algorithms for PV cybersecurity applications. We evaluate three state-of-the-art algorithms (One-Class SVM, Isolation Forest, and Local Outlier Factor) across 12 attack scenarios, establishing performance baselines and identifying algorithm-specific strengths and limitations. Our experimental results reveal a clear detectability hierarchy. This work proposes a standardized benchmark for PV cybersecurity research and provides the industry with evidence-based guidance for security system deployment.",

      "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are employed in numerous fields and applications. Even if most of these approaches offer a very good performance, they are affected by the “black-box” problem. The way they operate and make decisions is complex and difficult for human users to interpret, making the systems impossible to manually adjust in case they make trivial (from a human viewpoint) errors. In this paper, we show how a “white-box” approach based on eXplainable AI (XAI) can be applied to the Domain Name System (DNS) tunneling detection problem, a cybersecurity problem already successfully addressed by “black-box” approaches, in order to make the detection explainable. The obtained results show that the proposed solution can achieve a performance comparable to the one offered by an autoencoder-based solution while offering a clear view of how the system makes its choices and the possibility of manual analysis and adjustments.",

These digital relays enhance fault detection, monitoring, and response mechanisms, ensuring the reliability and stability of power networks. However, their connectivity and reliance on communication protocols introduce significant cybersecurity risks, making them potential targets for malicious attacks. Cyber threats against digital protection relays can lead to severe consequences, including cascading failures, equipment damage, and compromised grid security. This paper presents a comprehensive review of cybersecurity challenges in digital electrical protection relays, focusing on four key areas: (1) a taxonomy of cyber attack models targeting protection relays, (2) the associated risks and their potential impact on power systems, (3) existing mitigation strategies to enhance relay security, and (4) future research directions to strengthen resilience against cyber threats.",

      "abstract": "Modern smart grids are defined by the integration of distributed energy resources, such as renewable energy systems, conventional power sources, and energy storage units. These elements often utilize advanced control technologies that connect to generators via smart inverters, which exposes them to a range of cyber threats. To tackle these vulnerabilities, it is essential to have datasets that record cyberattacks on such systems, facilitating risk assessment and the creation of robust monitoring solutions. In response to this requirement, this paper presents Photo-Set, an open-source dataset specifically developed for cybersecurity analysis in photovoltaic systems.",

To address these challenges, this paper presents the Security Operation and Event Management (SOEM) platform, a software designed to support Security Operations Centers (SOCs) in reaching full visibility of OT environments. SOEM integrates diverse log sources and intrusion detection systems, including logs generated by the control system itself and additional on-the-shelf products, to enhance situational awareness and enable rapid incident response. The pilot project was carried out within the funded project SOC-OT-IGE from the “Centro di Competenza Start 4.0” and is being developed in partnership with Ansaldo Energia and HWG Sababa. The validation has been conducted in a real-world pilot project. Thanks to the mapping to requirements for compliance with IEC 62443, the platform demonstrates its effectiveness through defined key performance indicators (KPIs). This work bridges the gap between IT-centric SOC methodologies and the specialized needs of industrial cybersecurity.",

However, the technical requirements that enable VPPs to deliver these time-critical services simultaneously create unique cybersecurity vulnerabilities that distinguish them from traditional power generation and conventional smart grid systems. This paper establishes systematic connections between VPP technical requirements and cybersecurity threats through the integrated application of NIST and MITRE frameworks. The objective is to reveal critical threats specifically pertaining to ancillary services, comprehensive attack vector classification using MITRE ATT&CK techniques adapted for VPP environments, and mitigation strategies that maintain operational performance while addressing identified vulnerabilities.",

      "abstract": "With the advancement of regulations regarding the reduction in carbon emissions, renewable energy communities have come into the picture. However, many implications come with the installation of these communities from a cybersecurity point of view. The software platforms responsible for managing and controlling them handle a lot of crucial information, and therefore, tampering with these data can lead to several impacts on the operation of these communities and, in turn, the power grid as well. This paper examines the plausible impacts that can be caused by altering certain parameters of the system that make it a potential cyber attack target. The analysis is done by observing how the grid responds to these manipulations for both low-voltage as well as medium-voltage systems. These systems are designed along with integrated energy communities and are implemented in MATLAB/Simulink R2022b software. The observations are made by plotting the grid voltage and power profiles in normal as well as attacked conditions.",

Due to the unique operational demands of ICS environments, traditional IT security measures are often unsuitable. To address these challenges, we present our approach for enhancing cybersecurity in energy generation plants by correlating and consolidating alerts and logs from various monitoring devices, thereby providing real-time dashboards for anomaly and threat detection. The approach is based on the development of a platform that aids Security Operation Center (SOC) teams in monitoring operational technology within industrial networks. The paper outlines the functionalities of the platform, that will be developed within the 'SOC OT Impianti Generazione Energia' (SOC-OT IGE) project.",

      "abstract": "The integration of the Renewable Energy Directive II (REDII) into the legislation of European Union member states and the subsequent proliferation of Renewable Energy Communities (REC) has highlighted the need for software platforms to support the administrative, financial, and technical operations of these communities. However, the rise of RECs also introduces significant cybersecurity risks, including financial losses, privacy violations, and broader threats to the stability of the distribution grid. Despite these risks, RECs present a unique opportunity to address cybersecurity concerns from inception, ensuring that security measures are integrated into their design, thereby reducing the complexity and cost of later countermeasures. This paper proposes an IEC 62443-based framework for the secure-by-design development of RECs; after analyzing the risks, the paper proposes a set of guidelines for its mitigation, and validates the proposed approach showing how a REC that respects these guidelines would be compliant with the IEC 62443 standard.",

To allow a full performance evaluation of these security mechanisms as well as the extension of their detection skills concerning new cyber-physical-attacks, this paper introduces an open-source dataset, called Industrial Control System - Anomaly Detection Dataset (ICS-ADD). ICS-ADD would like to be a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners who aim to develop, test, and benchmark new cyber-physical security monitoring and detection technologies. ICS-ADD comprises raw network traffic captures of an industrial control system (ICS) subjected to a variety of simulated cyber-attacks, including but not limited to denial of service (DoS), man-in-the-middle (MITM), and malware infiltration. In addition to raw network traffic, ICS-ADD includes the output of two widely utilized open-source security monitoring tools, OSSIM (Open Source Security Information Management) and Suricata, which offer insights concerning the detection and analysis capabilities of existing security frameworks against threats. The analysis appearing in this paper highlights the complexity and variety of modern cyber threats in industrial environments and the novelty of ICS-ADD with respect to publicly available datasets. The reported performance analysis of OSSIM and Suricata by using ICS-ADD reveals areas of improvement for the detection of new attacks, which will be object of future research concerning the protection of industrial control systems.",

      "abstract": "Electric Vehicles (EVs) are getting widely adopted in cities in order to move towards a more sustainable transport system. However, with the increased penetration of EVs and their charging infrastructure, the distribution grid becomes more vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Therefore, it is essential to analyse the impact that cyber-attacks can cause on a low-voltage distribution grid. This paper aims to evaluate the effect produced by a cyber-attack against EV charging stations in the pan-European context. The IEEE European Low-Voltage Test Feeder (ELVTF) is used as a standard model for this study. The simulations are carried out using MATLAB/Simulink platform. The results from different attack locations in the model are used to draw out the final conclusions.",

These machines, called Smart Agricultural Machines (SAMs), integrate different information and communication technologies for monitoring and control purposes and can be remotely controlled by using proprietary protocols. This makes it difficult to assess the vulnerabilities of the system, in particular for non-proprietary-parties. SAMs are cyber-physical systems often employing private protocols and can be objects of attacks. In this context the paper proposes a framework, based on Software Defined Radio (SDR) technology, for cybersecurity verification of SAMs, in order to fill the gap in the state of the art since no technical standard specifically addresses cybersecurity in this environment; the paper describes the testbed developed and exploited to show the effectiveness in detecting vulnerabilities and assessing the SAM security, in particular focusing on the wireless communication channels, and reports the obtained results.",

The implementation of IDS within the SDN paradigm can simplify the implementation, speed up incident responses, and, in general, allow to promptly react to cyber attacks through proper countermeasures. Nevertheless, embedding IDS within SDN also introduces delays that cannot be tolerated in specific network environments, like industrial control systems. This paper focuses on the implementation of an IDS based on Machine Learning (ML) algorithms into an SDN architecture and proposes a very practical approach to reduce the delay by using the sequential implementation of prototypes of increasing software and hardware complexity so allowing quick tests to highlight the main problems, solve them and pass to the next operative step. A fully validated performance evaluation is then shown by exploiting all the presented solutions and by using further improved hardware features. The overall performance is very good and compliant with most, even if not yet all, industrial control systems constraints. Results show how the proposed solutions provide a significant improvement of the latency so opening the door to a real implementation in the field.",

These machines are often based on a CANbus control network and equipped with different wireless interfaces to implement different functionalities, such as remote control through radio links, GPS-based localization, and Wi-Fi-based data exchange.

In this context, it is crucial to develop efficient procedures for network security verification of automated agricultural vehicles.

      "abstract": "Critical Infrastructures (CIs) are sensible targets. They could be physically damaged by natural or human actions, causing service disruptions, economic losses, and, in some extreme cases, harm to people. They, therefore, need a high level of protection against possible unintentional and intentional events. In this paper, we show a logical architecture that exploits information from both physical and cybersecurity systems to improve the overall security in a power plant scenario. We propose a Machine Learning (ML)-based anomaly detection approach to detect possible anomaly events by jointly correlating data related to both the physical and cyber domains. The performance evaluation showed encouraging results—obtained by different ML algorithms—which highlights how our proposed approach is able to detect possible abnormal situations that could not have been detected by using only information from either the physical or cyber domain.",

      "abstract": "The way of generating and distributing energy throughout the electrical grid to all users is evolving. The concept of Smart Grid (SG) took place to enhance the management of the electrical grid infrastructure and its functionalities from the traditional system to an improved one. To measure the energy consumption of the users is one of these functionalities that, in some countries, has already evolved from a periodical manual consumption reading to a more frequent and automatic one, leading to the concept of Smart Metering (SM). Technology improvement could be applied to the SM systems to allow, on one hand, a more efficient way to collect the energy consumption data of each user, and, on the other hand, a better distribution of the available energy through the infrastructure. Widespread communication solutions based on existing telecommunication infrastructures instead of using ad-hoc ones can be exploited for this purpose. In this paper, we recall the basic elements and the evolution of the SM network architecture focusing on how it could further improve in the near future. We report the main technologies and protocols which can be exploited for the data exchange throughout the infrastructure and the pros and cons of each solution. Finally, we propose an innovative solution as a possible evolution of the SM system. This solution is based on a set of Internet of Things (IoT) communication technologies called Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) which could be employed to improve the performance of the currently used technologies and provide additional functionalities. We also propose the employment of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to periodically collect energy consumption data, with evident advantages especially if employed in rural and remote areas. We show some preliminary performance results which allow assessing the feasibility of the proposed approach.",

The proposed work focuses on an anomaly detection strategy based on the physical behavior of the industrial process. The algorithm extracts some measures of the physical parameters of the system and processes them with a neural network architecture called autoencoder in order to build a classifier making decisions about the behavior of the system and detecting possible cyber-attacks or faults. The results are quite promising for a practical application in real systems.",

      "abstract": "Anomaly detection is an important issue heavily investigated within different research areas and application domains. Its application in the industrial systems sector may be essential also for the protection of critical infrastructures. Due to the huge amount of involved data and to their complexity the use of machine learning may be the clue. The basic idea is describing an industrial process by a series of key attributes whose measures (the features) compose a state vector including heterogeneous types of measurements. Each feature should be a key attribute which can help discriminate between a normal functioning condition and an anomaly. In this context, the paper presents the use of a deep neural network architecture called autoencoder to detect anomalies due to either system faults or cyberattacks. The chosen application field is a photovoltaic system connected to the grid. The results, even if preliminary, are really promising.",
