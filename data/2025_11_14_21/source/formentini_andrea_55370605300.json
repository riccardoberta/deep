This paper presents a detailed analysis of the efficiency, power loss, and THD characteristics of multiplexed multilevel converters and neutral point clamped converters. Using MATLAB<sup>®</sup>Simulink 2024b, the switching and conduction losses of both multiplexed multilevel converters and NPC converters are calculated. The three-level NPC converter offers advantages of a simpler design, reduced component count, and cost effectiveness with the drawback of low voltage quality. Simulation results validate the THD, power losses, and efficiency for the conventional three-phase three-level NPC converter and the three-phase multiplexed multilevel converter, and a detailed comparison is performed.",

The converter is designed to interface renewable energy sources and electric storages like supercapacitors or batteries, particularly in electric or hybrid vehicles and distributed generation systems. The proposed algorithm, first introduced in [1], calculates optimal duty cycles for the switches based on target conditions derived from reference values of source currents, achieving precise and fast response. Moreover, Discontinuous Conduction Mode (DCM) is exploited at low current levels, to increase efficiency. Experimental tests on a laboratory prototype demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness and robustness to parametric uncertainties, as well as its superiority over a traditional PI-based method in terms of dynamic response.",

However, hybrid configurations, such as those integrating supercapacitor systems, are nowadays widely studied due to their potential to enhance efficiency, driving performance, and component lifespan. Supercapacitors offer significantly higher power density than batteries, making them valuable for FCEVs adoption. In this paper the use of battery and supercapacitors in a FCEV is investigated and the resulting energy consumption is compared under real road conditions. In addition, experimental tests have been carried out on Li-NMC battery cells and simulation tests have been conducted to validate the presented analysis.",

      "abstract": "This article presents a new control algorithm for matrix converters based on full-state feedback. An H2-linear matrix inequality (LMI) framework has been adopted to expand the system stability region. The proposed approach differs from other stabilization methods proposed in literature by its ability to increase the power transfer through the converter while maintaining high control bandwidth and preserving the quality of input and output quantities. A Kalman filter has been introduced to estimate the full system state avoiding the installation of additional sensors. Furthermore, the method has a limited computational burden not requiring high performance control platform. Experimental tests compare the performance of the proposed strategy with a stabilization approach previously proposed in terms of stability performance and power quality.",

As, however, the switching frequency decreases, problems arise, such as high current distortions and poor dynamic performance. Optimized pulse patterns (OPPs) can be employed to improve the current quality, but they need to be properly handled to achieve good transient response. This papers presents a gradient-based direct model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for PMSM drives that manipulates OPPs in real time such that superior steady-state performance and fast settling times are achieved.

      "abstract": "High-frequency signal injection sensorless algorithms are widely studied and used for rotor angle estimation in permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) at low speed or standstill. One of the main drawbacks of such methods is the acoustic noise connected to the voltage injection. In order to minimize this problem, it is advisable to increase the frequency of the injected signal. Thus, many studies focus on square-wave injection at the switching frequency, which is the maximum theoretical frequency. Since these methods exploit the rotor magnetic anisotropy, it is relatively easy to use them in interior PMSMs, where the rotor anisotropy is high. On the contrary, it is hard to exploit them in surface PMSMs, which have an almost symmetric rotor, although a low rotor magnetic anisotropy is still present. In this article, a sensorless algorithm with switching frequency square-wave injection is developed for surface PMSMs. To increase the signal-to-noise ratio, current oversampling is exploited. The benefits of such a technique are demonstrated with experimental results on a 2 N·m SPMSM.",

In the context of an electric vehicle engine connected to a DC charger, this study introduces a state of charge (SOC)-governed method for charging li-ion battery modules using a cascaded H-bridge converter. The key strength of this algorithm lies in its ability to achieve balanced charging of battery modules across all three-phase submodules while simultaneously controlling the DC charger, eliminating the need for an additional intermediate converter. Moreover, the algorithm is highly customizable, allowing adaptation to various configurations involving different numbers of submodules per phase.

      "abstract": "This article presents a new topology for EV powertrain, called Reconfigurable Cascaded Multilevel Converter, able to simultaneously implement power conversion and active battery system management. The latter feature is performed through the Reconfigurable Battery Module structure, where the serial connection of cells is controlled through a pattern of switches. This work contributes to the improvement of EV powertrain multilevel topologies by adding the advantages of reconfigurable systems. Compared to other multilevel topologies, an optimized control algorithm allows maintaining the converter efficiency comparable to more standard solutions and, concurrently, performing sorting algorithms to keep balanced State of Charge dynamics between the cells. Moreover, the new topology can be completely customized, according to different application requirements. To validate its feasibility in terms of efficiency, the converter is compared to other three alternative topologies. Efficiency measurements are carried out to validate the comparison. Finally, experimental results show how the active management of the battery stack can avoid voltage imbalances and be resilient to sudden voltage or load changes.",

This technique fills the gap for the complex reconfigurable structures, allowing the estimation of the parameters with only the knowledge of the output current and voltage and instantaneous active battery cells. The estimation technique is combined with a sorting algorithm to address the specific topic of multilevel converter controlled with digital modulation. Specifically, the estimation algorithm here presented ensures a reduced convergence time, demonstrated by the low mean error computed. Moreover, the estimation technique is simulated during both discharging and charging processes, showing how different initial conditions may affect the convergence time depending on the power flow.",

Subsequently, a globally optimized local controller is synthesized for the AFE keeping in consideration the interaction between the converter and the grid.

      "abstract": "A new control strategy that combines the resonant controller and the repetitive-controller based on the disturbance-observer (RSCDO) for off-grid four-leg voltage source inverter (VSI) has been presented in this paper. The aim of the new controller is to regulate the inverter output voltage, reducing as much as possible the voltage total harmonic distortion (THDv) in every load condition. The resonant controller allows to adjust the voltage at the fundamental harmonic, while the repetitive observer is able to compensate the voltage distortions due to inverter nonlinearity. The proposed strategy has been at first validated by means of simulation results performed in MATLAB/Simulink environment. Then, the new control strategy has been implemented in field-programmable gate array (FPGA) using LabView environmental and experimental results are performed on the 40 kVA three-phase 4-leg VSI prototype.",

The converter is directly connected to an AC three-phase power system and the battery modules are charged by dynamically controlling the reconfigurable battery modules. The intrinsic structure of the converter gives the advantage to implement different charging algorithms, according to customizable requirements, without the need of extra middle power stages. Two charging methods are proposed and explained in detail: the first one prioritizes the SOC balancing between the battery modules, the second one the power losses reduction. Finally, a charging time estimation is computed for the RCMC and for a classic battery pack, assuming to increase their initial state of charge of 20%. The computation results show that the Reconfigurable Cascaded Multilevel Converter requires 40% less time than the battery pack.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, a double-input bidirectional DC-DC converter is taken into account. The converter allows to use less switches than a traditional solution and, moreover, it guarantees a higher efficiency. The modulation strategy proposed in the technical literature allows the converter to work in Discontinuous Conduction Mode at low-load and, therefore, to increase the efficiency in comparison to the CCM. However, such a control reduces the dynamics of the converter. To improve the transient response, a Feed-Forward approach is proposed in this paper. Since the converter model in DCM is complex and highly nonlinear, a simplified model is considered. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is proved with experimental results on a converter prototype.",

      "abstract": "Rotor position estimation in sensorless control of PMSM at low speed or standstill is often obtained using high-frequency voltage injection. This method leads to some drawbacks, the main of which is acoustic noise. The frequency of the injected signal should therefore be increased to minimize this problem. A square-wave signal injection at the switching frequency is the subject of many studies, since this is the maximum theoretically achievable frequency. These methods are based on the exploitation of the rotor magnetic saliency and therefore they are widely used with interior PMSMs. On the contrary, the low anisotropy that characterizes surface PMSMs makes it difficult to obtain a good signal-to-noise ratio. A method that uses square-wave voltage injection at the switching frequency is proposed in this study for surface PMSMs. In particular, a new current oversampling method is developed, in order to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. Experimental results on a 2 Nm surface PMSM are showed, to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.",

The study has been carried out on a notional electrical system composed of two three-phase power converters - a voltage source inverter and an active front end. The beginning of the article presents the origin of the issue - trend of reducing the filter size and weight, which is especially true in the aircraft industry. Then, the roles of the filter and their design challenges are discussed. The next part of the article describes the controller's constraints, its design, and the control system modeling approach, including a specially developed simulation tool used for the interactions analysis. Simulation results with the experimental verification are presented showing the interactions impact on the system dynamics. Finally, optimization of the filters under dynamic control constraints considering system's components interaction are presented as the simulation tool application.",

      "abstract": "In the past two decades, much research and industry effort has been dedicated to transportation electrification. In particular, aerospace industry, with the more electric aircraft (MEA) revolution, is shifting toward the usage of electrical in place of mechanical energy on board to save fossil fuel and reduce polluting emissions. For this reason, phase-locked loops (PLLs) systems have been well developed for synchronizing different power sources and loads within the aircraft electrical grid. Since one of the proposed solutions for MEA power grids is to operate at variable frequency from 360 to 800 Hz, a third-order model-based steady-state linear Kalman filter PLL (SSLKF-PLL) has been proposed in the literature to achieve fast tracking performance during such grid frequency variations. To suppress the potential disturbances due to harmonics in the grid, sensor scaling errors/unbalances, and dc offsets while maintaining low computational burden, this article aims to enhance the disturbance rejection ability of SSLKF-PLL by adding a repetitive observer (RO). Simulation and experimental tests show that RO allows stable and effective suppression of disturbances from all the abovementioned sources during variable frequency operation. The execution time of the proposed PLL is only 4.23 μs using a Xilinx Zynq-7000-based platform, where the added RO takes 2.664 μs to execute, and the SSLKF-PLL alone takes 1.566 μs.",

      "abstract": "This article presents three-phase and single-phase open-circuit fault-tolerant control strategies of radial suspension force and torque generation for bearingless multisector surface mounted permanent magnet synchronous machines. A combined winding topology is installed in the stator so that each phase contributes to both suspension force and motoring torque production. Indeed, a triple sectored three-phase winding is employed. Each three-phase winding is supplied by a power converter to independently control the suspension force vector and torque over each sector. An analytical formulation of the force and torque generation is described considering both three-phase open-circuit and single-phase open-circuit fault conditions. The analytical models of the machine are presented in a generalized matrix form so that they can be applied to any machine with a multisector winding structure. The analytical models are then used to derive the control algorithms that allow us to control the bearingless machine when a whole three-phase winding or one phase of one or two sectors are open circuited. The theoretical analysis is verified with both finite elements analysis and experiment tests. This system shows a good open-circuit fault-tolerant capability.",

      "abstract": "In modern power systems, the proliferation of power electronics converters, and distributed generation raises important issues concerning inter-connected switching units in terms of performance, stability and robustness. Such phenomenon are more prominent in micro-grids, such as modern local low voltage distribution systems, more electric aircraft power systems etc., where many power converters are connected to the same non-stiff low power ac grid, and strongly interact with each other. Locally designed converter control systems on the same electrical bus exhibit interactive behaviour. If not taken properly into account, external disturbances to the system at given operating conditions may result in the degradation of performance, failure to meet operating conditions and, in some cases, instability. This paper presents a new approach to synthesise converter controllers in more electric aircraft ac distribution grids (which is, however, applicable to all power electronics embedded systems), keeping in consideration dynamic interactions among subsystems. An optimal control design approach based on H<inf>2</inf> optimisation is therefore proposed. Phase-locked loops have also been considered, and their tuning has been included in the general tuning procedure of the whole system. Simulation, and experimental results show good improvements in terms of dynamic performance, and interaction mitigation.",

      "abstract": "Power converters have turned into a critical and every-day solution for electric power systems. In fact, the incorporation of renewable energies has led towards the constant improvement of power converter topologies and their controls. In this context, over the last 10 years, model predictive control (MPC) is positioned as one the most studied and promising alternatives for power converter control. In voltage source inverters (VSI), MPC has only been applied in the inner current control loop, accelerating and improving its dynamic response, but as mentioned, has been limited only to the current control loop. The fastest of the MPC techniques is the Deadbeat (DB) control, and in this paper, it is proposed to employ DB control on the entire system, therefore accelerating the time response not only for the current loops, but also for voltage loops. At the same time, this avoids overshoots and overpower in order to protect the power converter, leading to the fastest dynamic response according to VSI capabilities. For renewable energies, fast-dynamics entails fast maximum power tracking and therefore, maximizes energy harvesting, or in other words, reduces the losses due to the control dynamics. Thus, this paper gives a clear procedure and key points for designing a DB control for all the variables based on a mathematical model, which is corroborated by simulations and the experimental results.",

In the proposed topology, each battery cell can be individually connected or bypassed according to the required voltage and current levels. Both the charging and discharging processes can be controlled to avoid voltage imbalances between the cells and to enhance fault tolerance, battery life, and safety. Converter switching and conduction losses are evaluated and used as key parameters for the optimization of the proposed architecture. Furthermore, an efficiency comparison between a conventional three-phase IGBT-based inverter and the proposed topology is carried out. The two topologies are evaluated according to the WLTP Class 3 driving cycles, showing their average efficiency in each cycle. The comparison results show that the performance achieved with the proposed topology is extremely promising to combine state-of-the-art functionalities with the new paradigm of battery management.",

      "abstract": "This article presents a current limitation technique for a multiphase bearingless machine featuring a combined winding system. This winding structure allows the machine to produce both suspension force and motoring torque. The main challenges with the combined winding configuration consist of decoupling the suspension force and torque generation and designing a proper current limitation algorithm. The former topic has been already tackled and presented in previous publications, while the latter will be addressed in this article. In particular, the proposed suspension force control technique will allow to prioritize either suspension force or torque generation. In this article, the priority is given to the rotor levitation, hence the suspension force rather than the torque is essential. Finally, simulation results and experiment validation on a $\\text{1.5}\\,\\text{kW}/3000\\,\\text{r/min}$ prototype machine are provided.",

      "abstract": "Under the concept of transportation electrification, more electric aircraft (MEA) involves more electrical energy to reduce emissions. Phase-looked loops (PLLs) have been well developed for synchronizing different power sources in a grid. Since MEA operates at variable frequency from 360 Hz to 800 Hz, a third-order model based steady-state linear Kalman filter PLL (SSLKF-PLL) has been proposed in literature to achieve fast tracking performance during such grid frequency variations. To suppress the potential disturbances due to harmonics in the grid, sensor scaling errors/unbalances and d.c offsets while maintaining low computational burden, this paper aims to enhance the disturbance rejection ability of SSLKF-PLL by adding a repetitive observer (RO). Simulation tests show that RO allows stable and effective suppression of disturbances from all above-mentioned sources during variable frequency operation.",

The proposed topology allows current and voltage regulation for energy storage devices such as EVs batteries. Compared to a standard Dual-Active-Bridge topology, the Matrix converter allows to directly perform an AC-AC energy conversion thus eliminating the rectifying stage. A high frequency (HF) voltage waveform is generated to feed the isolation transformer, which is characterized by an almost negligible leakage inductance, allowing for the reduction of the transformer voltage drops. The rectification of the ac-waveform is achieved at the output stage, consisting of an H-bridge and an LC filter. The suggested topology powered with the proposed modulation is able to provide a wide output voltage range which can vary from 50 V to 500 V, providing up to a maximum power of 25 kW allowed for level I chargers.",

Nevertheless, SPMSMs offer high torque density, high efficiency simple manufacturing process and robustness which makes them an attractive alternative to Interior PMSMs. The Open End Winding (OEW) dual inverter topology, with one of the two Voltage Source Inverters (VSI) connected to a floating capacitor (FC), has shown to be capable of significantly increasing the operating speed range and CPSR of the SPMSM at the price of an increased controller complexity.

      "abstract": "A lad-used servo permanent magnet synchronous motor has been accidentally damaged due to overcurrent. On the one hand, the mechanical damage, in the end, bearing and break part generates acoustic noise even when rotating the shaft by hand. On the other hand, the back electromotive force of the motor becomes unbalanced and exceedingly high torque ripple is produced. Such torque ripple results in intolerable speed ripple and will increase the acoustic noise. This article aims to reuse this damaged motor by adding a repetitive observer (RO) to the existing speed loop, both the speed control performance and the acoustic noise of the damaged motor can become comparable with its healthy version. The RO is functionally the same as a repetitive controller (RC), but the stability of the RO is independent of the feedback loop, while the stability of the RC will affect and be affected by the rest of the system. Therefore, RO can be applied for both the healthy motor and the damaged motor. This work opens the possibility of further enhancing the fault tolerance ability of a healthy motor or even reusing a damaged motor and still achieve high performance.",

      "abstract": "The interest in multiphase machines for high power and reliable drives has been growing, and many control algorithms have been proposed to improve their torque performance. This article presents a new approach to the modeling of a multi three-phase drive, aiming at the minimization of the torque ripple introduced by the pulsewidth modulation (PWM) voltage excitation, by the shift of carrier phase angles among different three-phase inverters. The underlying idea is to use standard three-phase converters feeding the individual segment and to apply a phase shift between the PWM carriers. For the torque ripple analyzed in this article, only the interaction between the armature field, resulting from the PWM voltage excitation, and the fundamental component of the permanent-magnet field is considered. The proposed carrier phase-shift angles are obtained for a case study of a sectored triple three-phase synchronous permanent-magnet machine. Analytical, numerical and finite-element analysis results are presented to explain how the carrier shift angles affect the current and torque ripple. Finally, experimental results are presented to validate the model and the control algorithm.",

      "abstract": "The angle-based repetitive controller (RC) has been applied successfully in the literature for torque ripple suppression in variable speed permanent magnet synchronous machines (PMSMs). The RC is preferred because of its learning capability, which allows the cancelation of all periodic ripples from multiple sources. However, its tuning method has not yet been proposed. Since the structure of the RC is found similar to the disturbance observer (DOB), which is convenient to tune through pole placement, this paper merges the angle-based RC and DOB into a novel angle-based repetitive observer (ARO) for the first time for the torque ripple reduction in PMSMs. ARO takes advantages of its DOB structure that it can be designed separately and can easily be added into an existing control loop. Taking advantage of its RC nature, ARO can tackle a wide frequency range of torque ripple even in the presence of measurement noise. The experimental test results have confirmed the robust performance of ARO under five conditions, including the ideal integral delay, the fractional delay, the load transient, the speed transient, and the detuned mechanical parameters conditions. The execution time of the ARO is less than 10$\\,\\mu$s.",

      "abstract": "The proposed paper presents an active vibration suppression technique for a multi three-phase permanent magnet synchronous machine equipped with mechanical bearings. The mathematical model of the radial force and torque generation of the considered machine is introduced at first. In this work the radial force is exploited to damp mechanical vibrations detected on the machine housing. The state space representation of the mechanical plant is provided and employed to design the active vibration control. The latter consists of multiple resonant controllers each of them tuned to suppress one specific harmonic of vibration. In this study two different vibration harmonics are considered, hence the active vibration control consists of two resonant controllers placed in parallel. The linear quadratic regulator technique has been employed to select the optimal controller gains in the whole speed range. The technique is then validated in the Matlab-Simulink environment showing that the active vibration control can effectively suppress the detected vibrations.",

      "abstract": "Electrification of non-propulsive aircraft systems has resulted in the increased proliferation of power electronics embedded grids on aircraft. Typically, power converters on these networks are optimised locally without consideration to the wider grid dynamics, which as a result increases the interactive effect between sub-systems. Filters are typically used to decouple these interactive effects, however since weight is a key design factor for aircraft, filters are typically reduced in size, further increasing interactive effects. Recent studies into H2 control, due to its ability to develop decentralised controls whilst considering the global grid dynamic model, have shown to reduce these interactive effects, however studies concentrate only on fixed frequency systems, atypical to modern variable frequency grids on modern aircraft today. In this paper, H2 optimisation is used to optimise a target converter to a pre-designed converter generating the variable frequency AC bus. The proposed method shows that not only are interactions reduced on the target converter for all frequencies but allows the pre-designed system to run as designed without detrimental performance, even during large power transients for full range of frequencies. This paper includes mathematical derivations, key design points, and has been validated and compared against other popular controls by experiment.",

      "abstract": "In a common dc-link dual-fed open-end winding permanent magnet synchronous motor (OEW-PMSM) topology, it is well known how the additional flow of a zero-sequence current (ZSC) is permitted. The low zero-sequence impedance characteristic of high-speed machines leads to high-intensity and high-frequency ripple of the ZSC. Therefore, there is a necessity to eliminate the zero-sequence-voltage (ZSV) produced by the two voltage source converters that feed the machine. Furthermore, the non-sinusoidal back electromagnetic force (back EMF) causes the circulation of a third harmonic ZSC. An OEW-PMSM high-speed starter-generator fed by a dual-inverter with a single dc-link is considered. Part I of this paper proposes a modulation for the considered topology able to eliminate instantaneously the ZSV produced. In this paper, a detailed analysis of the deadtime (DT) effect on the ZSV has been carried out and a novel hysteresis control for the ZSC using the DT as a control action is presented. The DT produces a ZSV distortion on the zero-axis that can be used to control the third harmonic ZSC flowing due to the non-sinusoidal machine back EMF.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, a dual-fed (DF) common dc-link topology open-end winding permanent magnet synchronous motor for aircraft high-speed starter-generator application is considered. While on one hand the common dc bus configuration significantly simplifies and reduces the costs of the topology, on the other hand it allows the zero-sequence current (ZSC) to flow freely in the system. High-speed machines are characterized by low phase inductance, which implies low zero-sequence impedance. A small time constant of the zero-sequence circuit produces a high-frequency, high-intensity ZSC ripple with the risk of harming the switching devices. This paper presents a novel hybrid space vector pulsewidth modulation that allows to instantaneously eliminate the zero-sequence voltage (ZSV) produced by the two voltage source converters (VSCs) by square wave modulating one of the two VSCs. The non-sinusoidal machine back electromotive force (EMF) has been considered and the effect of the converters' dead time on the ZSV has been analyzed. The square-wave-modulated VSC uses insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) devices, whereas the other uses Silicon Carbide (SiC) technology. The proposed topology is tested through both simulations and experiments.",

Due to the changes in its electromagnetic configuration, the motor suffers from extremely high torque ripple, which produces intolerable speed ripple and acoustic noise. The aim of this paper is to evaluate if a repetitive observer (RO) can be used to smooth the rotational speed and suppress acoustic noise. The RO is functionally the same as a repetitive controller (RC), but is preferred due to its simplicity of tuning. Its effectiveness of reducing acoustic noise will be evaluated in this paper for the first time. Experimental test results show that the speed ripple and acoustic noise are reduced significantly. The work opens the possibility of reusing the damaged motor and still achieve high performance. The RO can also be applied to enhance the fault tolerance capability of a healthy motor.",

      "abstract": "The increasing use of power electronics systems and distributed generation in modern power networks has raised important issues regarding the effects that inter-connected converters systems can have on the performance and stability of the whole grid. Interactions between locally optimized converters, designed not taking into account the external influence of the system in which they are operating, may lead to performance degradation or even system instability and failure. This paper will deal with the problem of active-front end control design taking into account of system interactions with other power converters in the grid. A globally optimized local converter control tuning method, which is based on a state space model identification of the unknown grid system seen from the converter at its point of common coupling (PCC), is here proposed. The plant for the control design will then be not only represented by the local converter dynamics, but will also include the identified system at the PCC. In order to describe and validate the concept, a simplified notional system, comprising of two interconnected converter systems coupled on the same AC bus is analyzed. The effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method is validated by experiments with a traditionally designed PI controller for comparison.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a current limitation technique for a multiphase bearingless machine featuring a combined winding system. This winding structure allows each machine phase to produce both suspension force and motoring torque. Compared to more conventional systems where two separate windings are adopted for the force and torque generation, the combined winding one leads to higher compactness and simpler manufacture. The main challenges with the combined winding configuration consist of decoupling the force and torque generation and designing a proper current limitation algorithm. The former topic has been already tackled and presented in previous publications, instead the latter will be addressed in this paper. In particular, the so called smart limitation technique will allow to prioritize either the suspension force or the torque generation. In this paper the priority is given to the rotor levitation, hence the suspension force rather than the torque is essential. The technique can be extended to give priority to the torque generation in further work and can be applied to any multiphase bearingless machine with similar winding structures. Finally, simulation results and experiment validation are provided.",

      "abstract": "This work investigates the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm as a tool to tune the control parameters of a Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC) in a single-terminal HVdc configuration. More precisely, due to its inherent capacity of handling system non-linearities, the PSO algorithm is used to tune a nonlinear control structure based on passivity arguments capable of ensuring global asymptotic stability of the converter. This nonlinear control strategy was successfully applied to the MMC in previous efforts, albeit with sub-optimal tuning, and therefore below par performance. Thus, this work aims to contribute to the state of the art by proving that system performance under the nonlinear control structure of interest can be further improved via PSO-tuning. Finally, to reduce the computational burden, we propose to apply the PSO algorithm directly to a recent state-space representation of an MMC with a constant equilibrium point.",

      "abstract": "The matrix converter is an AC/AC converter constituted by an array of controlled semiconductor switches that connects directly the three-phase source to the three-phase load. The major development of matrix converters begins when Alesina and Venturini proposed the basic principles of operation in the '80s. In their modulation methods, through the common-mode-voltage addition technique a voltage ratio of 86.6% can be obtained. In this paper, a novel method which preserves the same voltage ratio of traditional modulations is proposed. The key concept of this approach is to use only the two closest input voltages instead of all three-phase voltages. The duties cycle are computed on the knowledge of output power demand. With this arrangement, lower switching losses in addition to better harmonic content on output current can be achieved. Hence, this paper presents a detailed mathematical treatment of new modulation approach developed for matrix converter. To validate the proposed strategy, significantly simulation results achieved in co-simulation MATLAB/SIMULINK/PLECS environment will be shown and compared with Venturini's modulation.",

The common dc-link configuration significantly simplifies and reduces the costs of the topology but allows the Zero-Sequence Current (ZSC)to flow freely in the system. The Zero-Sequence Voltage (ZSV)produced by the two two-level Voltage Source Converters (VSCs)and the non-sinusoidal machine back-electro magnetic force (back-EMF)are responsible for the flow of additional current and the reduction of the overall system efficiency. The FCS-MPC is considered for the first time in this application as a simple solution to achieve both machine control and the ZSC suppression simultaneously. The main drawback of the FCS-MPC is the high amount of calculation necessary, here a different formulation of the FCS-MPC is proposed to significantly reduce the computational effort required.",

      "abstract": "Bearingless machines are relatively new devices that consent to suspend and spin the rotor at the same time. They commonly rely on two independent sets of three-phase windings to achieve a decoupled torque and suspension force control. Instead, the winding structure of the proposed multisector permanent magnet (MSPM) bearingless machine permits to combine the force and torque generation in the same three-phase winding. In this paper, the theoretical principles for the torque and suspension force generation are described and a reference current calculation strategy is provided. Then, a robust optimal position controller is synthesized. A multiple resonant controller is then integrated in the control scheme in order to suppress the position oscillations due to different periodic force disturbances and enhance the levitation performance. The linear quadratic regulator combined with the linear matrix inequality theory has been used to obtain the optimal controller gains that guarantee a good system robustness. Simulation and experimental results will be presented to validate the proposed position controller with a prototype bearingless MSPM machine.",

Key aims of MEA research include reducing the overall size and weight of the electrical system without compromise to performance. H2 control optimization have been gaining large attention in the development of controllers for such systems. In this paper, a comparative review between decentralised optimal H2 controllers, and more traditional PI control method for a three-phase embedded grid in MEA shall be undertaken. The comparison involves investigating the tuning process, the implementation, the performance and the capability of reducing the overall size and weight of the system. H2 controls are being designed with full knowledge of the system dynamics and interactions, and is expected in theory to deliver greater capability to meet MEA core research objectives, in contrast to traditional PI methods.",

The floating bridge inverter is used to compensate the reactive power of the main inverter and, hence, to maximize the active power delivered to the motor in compliance with the constraints of a limited current and voltage. The DC-link voltage of the floating bridge varies depending on the operating condition of the motor in order to reduce the switching losses and ensure the controllability of the system.

      "abstract": "In recent years, a considerable effort has been made to minimize the size of dc-link capacitors in single-phase active front ends (SP-AFEs), to reduce cost, and to increase power density. As a result of the lower energy storage, a high-bandwidth outer dc voltage control loop is required to respond to fast load changes. Linearized modeling is usually performed according to the power-balance method and the control is designed using LTI techniques. This is done assuming negligible voltage ripple at twice the grid frequency, and the model is considered valid up to the grid frequency. However, its precise validity limits are usually unknown and the control design becomes empirical when approaching these boundaries. To overcome this drawback, linear time-periodic (LTP) theory can be exploited, defining the range of validity of the LTI model and providing precise stability boundaries for the dc-link voltage loop. The main result is that LTP models more accurately describe the system behavior and provide superior results compared to the LTI ones. Theoretical analysis, simulations, and extensive experimental tests on a 10-kW converter are presented to validate the claims.",

This paper will deal with the problem of power converters control design taking into account system interactions with other power converters in the grid. A globally optimized control tuning approach along with a state space grid identification method is here presented. Simulation and experimental results clearly show that the dynamic behaviour of the proposed method outperforms standard tuning techniques.

The first method consists of modeling the motor in terms of torque and force production as a function of the stationary reference frame α-β currents. The current control reference signals are then evaluated adopting the Joule losses minimization as constrain by means of the pseudoinverse matrix. The second method is based on the control of the magnetic field harmonics in the airgap through the current space vector (SV) technique. Once the magnetic field harmonics involved in the torque and force production are determined, the SV transformation can be defined to obtain the reference current SVs. The methods are validated by numerical simulations, finite-element analysis, and experimental tests. The differences in terms of two degrees of freedom levitation performance and efficiency are highlighted in order to give the reader an in-depth comparison of the two methods.",

      "abstract": "The paper presents an automatic parameter identification procedure for linear permanent magnet synchronous motors. The electrical parameters of a test machine are estimated by identification tests performed through the inverter. The method employs the available feedback signals that are needed by the control. The stator resistance and machine inductances are estimated through signal injection at standstill. The permanent magnets' flux-linkage identification instead requires carriage movement. Subsequently, the inverter nonlinearity characteristics are identified, again at standstill, through a flux-observer. The proposed self-commissioning process requires only the nameplate data of the machine and no datasheet information of the power electronic devices is needed. The developed techniques can be used both with and without a position sensor. The complete process is automatic and safe to run on its own and requires least intervention from the operator.",

This paper takes advantage of the spatial distribution of the winding sets within the stator structure in a multisector permanent-magnet (MSPM) machine toward achieving a controllable radial force. An alternative force control technique for MSPM machines is presented. The mathematical model of the machine and the theoretical investigation of the force production principle are provided. A novel force control methodology based on the minimization of the copper losses is described and adopted to calculate the d-q axis current references. The predicted performances of the considered machine are benchmarked against finite-element analysis. The experimental validation of the proposed control strategy is presented, focusing on the suppression of selected vibration frequencies for different rotational speeds.",

      "abstract": "Stability analysis of power converters in ac networks is complex due to the nonlinear nature of the conversion systems. Whereas interactions of converters in dc networks can be studied by linearizing about the operating point, the extension of the same approach to ac systems poses serious challenges, especially for single-phase or unbalanced three-phase systems. A general method for stability analysis of power converters suitable for single-phase or unbalanced ac networks is presented in this paper, based on linear time periodic theory. A single-phase grid-connected inverter with phase-locked loop (PLL) is considered as case study. It is demonstrated that the stability boundaries can be precisely evaluated by the proposed method, despite the nonlinearity introduced by the PLL. Simulation and experimental results from a 10-kW laboratory prototype are provided to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed analysis.",

      "abstract": "Bearingless motors combine in the same structure the characteristics of conventional motors and magnetic bearings. Traditional bearingless machines rely on two independent sets of winding for suspension force and torque production, respectively. The proposed Multi-Sector Permanent Magnet (MSPM) motor exploits the spatial distribution of the multi-three-phase windings within the stator circumference in order to produce a controllable suspension force. Therefore, force and torque generation are embedded in the same winding setting. In this paper the force and torque generation principles are investigated and a mathematical model is presented considering the rotor displacement. A two Degree of freedom (DOF) position controller is designed taking into consideration the rotor overall dynamic system and a controller gains selection strategy is suggested. A simulation study of the bearingless system in different operating conditions is presented and the suspension force and torque produced are validated through Finite Element Analysis (FEA).",

      "abstract": "Periodic speed errors can occur in permanent magnet linear synchronous machines for two reasons: 1) a periodic reference signal; 2) cogging force and friction. For reducing such periodic errors, iterative learning control or repetitive control approaches, used in conjunction with more common control actions, can be strongly effective. However, the design of the stability filter, robustness filter and other parameters for a traditional repetitive controller can be a complex task and may need to be adjusted when the frequency of such periodic error varies. Existing solutions tend to develop more adaptive tuning methods for repetitive controller to enhance the whole control system. This paper shows that the performance of a traditional speed loop can be enhanced with a repetitive controller without complicating the tuning of the repetitive controller. Consequently, a position-based repetitive control combined with deadbeat current control method is proposed. Simulation results show that the proposed method is effective for reducing speed ripple at difference frequencies without necessarily adjusting its parameters.",

      "abstract": "Based on the internal model principle, repetitive controller (RC) is capable of reducing periodic torque ripple by generating a compensating action that consequently needs to be synchronized with the original ripple. However, the synchronization is difficult to achieve using the conventional RC when the sampling frequency is not integer multiple of the speed (known as fractional delay issue) or when the speed varies widely. To solve this problem, this paper presents a fractional delay variable frequency torque ripple reduction method for permanent magnet synchronous machine drives using the combination of angle-based RC and deadbeat current control. Four aspects of innovations are included in the proposed control to improve the synchronization. The experimental results show that the proposed control can effectively reduce torque ripple, even during speed and load transient.",

      "abstract": "Finite state model predictive control (MPC) has been recently applied to several converter topologies, as it can provide many advantages over other MPC techniques. The advantages of MPC include fast dynamics, multitarget control capability, and relatively easy implementation on digital control platforms. However, its inherent variable switching frequency and lower steady-state waveform quality with respect to standard control, which includes an appropriate modulation technique, represent a limitation to its applicability. Modulated model predictive control (M<sup>2</sup> PC) combines all the advantages of MPC with the fixed switching frequency characteristic of pulse-width modulation algorithms. The work presented in this paper focuses on the indirect matrix converter (IMC), where the tight coupling between rectifier stage and inverter stage has to be taken into account in the M<sup>2</sup>PC design. This paper proposes an M<sup>2</sup>PC solution, suitable for IMC, with a switching pattern that emulates the desired waveform quality features of space vector modulation for matrix converters. The switching sequences of the rectifier stage and inverter stage are rearranged in order to always achieve zero-current switching on the rectifier stage, thus simplifying the current commutation strategy.",

      "abstract": "The study presents the direct flux and current vector control of an induction motor (IM) drive, which is a relatively newer and promising control strategy, through the use of model predictive control (MPC) techniques. The results highlight that the fast flux control nature of direct flux control strategy is further enhanced by MPC. Predictive control is applied in two of its variants, namely the finite control set and modulated MPC, and the advantages and limitations of the two are underlined. This work also highlights, through experimental results, the importance of prioritising the flux part of the cost function which is particularly significant in the case of an IM drive. The performance of the MPC-based approach is compared with the proportional-integral controller, which also prioritises the flux control loop, under various operating regions of the drive such as in the flux-weakening regime. Simulations show the performance expected with different control strategies which is then verified through experiments.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes a dual fed common dc link inverter Open End Winding-Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (OEW-PMSM) Drive. In order to increase the system efficiency a dual technology converter is used, with one inverter composed of standard IGBT devices and the other composed of fast switching Silicon Carbide (SiC) devices. The common dc link OEW configuration allows the zero-sequence current (ZSC) to flow freely, and the low time constants of the zero-circuit can lead to high zero sequence current flow, with associated losses and stress on the power devices. To avoid this, the zero-sequence voltage produced by the switching combinations adopted to synthetize the control signals needs to be instantaneously eliminated. A novel modulation for dual converter configurations is proposed to eliminate the zero-sequence voltage(ZSV).",

In the last decade, many different expensive off-the-shelf tools for rapid prototyping and testing have been developed and commercialised by few market players. Recently, the increasing diffusion of low cost, Do It Yourself targeted development tools gained market shares previously controlled by conventional players. This trend has been driven by the fact that, despite their lower performances, many of these low cost systems are powerful enough to develop simple power electronics systems for learning and teaching purposes. This paper describes a control platform developed within the University of Nottingham, targeting at the market and application segment in between the expensive off-the-shelf control boards and the low cost emerging systems. The platform is based on the Microzed evaluation board, equipped with the Xilinx Zynq System-on-Chip. Its flexibility, features and performances will be addressed and examples of how they are being experimentally validated on different rigs will be provided.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a modification to the classical Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm and its application to active power filters. The proposed control is able to retain all the advantages of a finite control set MPC while improving the generated waveforms harmonic spectrum. In fact, a modulation algorithm, based on the cost function ratio for different output vectors, is inherently included in the MPC. The cost function-based modulator is introduced and its effectiveness on reducing the current ripple is demonstrated. The presented solution provides an effective and straightforward single loop controller, maintaining an excellent dynamic performance despite the modulated output and it is self-synchronizing with the grid. This promising method is applied to the control of a shunt active filter for harmonic content reduction through a reactive power compensation methodology. Significant results obtained by experimental testing are reported and commented, showing that MPC is a viable control solution for active filtering systems.",

By adding a correction term to the traditional RC and considering the disturbances as states, the repetitive controller can be designed in the same way as a disturbance observer. This paper presents therefore a new simple way of tuning a repetitive controller. Simulations show that, when compared with the traditional RC, the proposed RC configuration can achieve greater stability margin. As opposed to the traditional plug-in RC, the new RC structure studied in this paper is also shown to be robust against variations in the inner loop delays if it is used in a cascaded configuration. The immunity to plant parameter variations is another added benefit of the proposed controller.",

      "abstract": "The paper presents a new implementation of direct flux and current vector control of an induction motor drive using the techniques of model predictive control. The advantages offered by predictive control are used to enhance the dynamics of direct flux vector control. To minimize the problems of variable switching frequency inherent to finite control set predictive control, an alternative approach using pulse width modulation is studied for command execution as occurs in the so-called modulated model predictive control. A comparison between finite control set and modulated model predictive control is presented and the results are also compared with the control implementation through traditional proportional-integral regulators to highlight the advantages and drawbacks of predictive control based strategies. Apart from a greater harmonic content in stator currents, the predictive control can offers control dynamics comparable with proportional-integral control while maintaining immunity against machine parameter variations and excluding the need for controller tuning.",

      "abstract": "High bandwidth and accuracy of the current control loop are fundamental requisites when a fast torque response is required or for facilitating the reduction of torque ripple in high-performance drives, especially at high speed. One of the most suitable control methods to achieve these goals is dead beat current control (DBCC). Many types of DBCCs have been proposed and implemented in the literature. This study proposes a DBCC incorporating two new functionalities. One is a two steps current prediction to improve prediction accuracy when current measurements are taken place before each sampling period; and particularly to reduce the overshoot during transients when mean value is used as current feedback. The second is a novel compensation method for the rotor movement to eliminate offset errors which occur at high speed. Moreover, the dynamic and steady-state performance of the proposed DBCC is assessed in simulations. On the basis of the simulation tests, the control parameters are tuned for experiments and the performance of the proposed functionalities are verified. Finally, the advantage of DBCC, compared with a classical dq proportional-integral current regulator, is verified in experiments.",

Radial force control has been widely investigated for a variety of bearingless machines and can be also applied to conventional PMSM aiming the reduction of the mechanical stress on the bearings as well as reduce the overall vibration. Traditional bearingless motors rely on two independent sets of windings dedicated to torque and suspension respectively. The work presented in this paper takes advantage of the spatial distribution of the winding sets within the stator structure towards achieving a controllable net radial force. In this paper the α-β axis model for the MSPM and the theoretical investigation of the force production principle is presented. A novel force control methodology based on the Single Value Decomposition (SVD) technique is described. The predicted performances of the MSPM have been validated using Finite Element simulations and benchmarked against state of the art control techniques.",

The use of an FCS-MPC makes the implementation of most of the existing sensorless techniques difficult due to the lack of a modulator. The proposed sensorless algorithm exploits the saliency of the motor and the intrinsic higher current ripple of the FCS-MPC to extract position and speed information using a model-based approach. This method does not require the injection of additional voltage vectors or the periodic interruption of the control algorithm and consequently it has no impact on the performance of the current control. The proposed algorithm has been tested in simulation and validated on an experimental setup, showing promising results.",

      "abstract": "Finite States Model Predictive Control (MPC) has been recently applied to several converters topologies for the many advantages it can provide such as fast dynamics, multi-target control capabilities, easy implementation on digital control board and capability of including constraints in the control law. However, its variable switching frequency and lower steady state waveform quality, with respect to standard control plus modulator systems, represents a limitation to its applicability. Modulated Model Predictive Control (M<sup>2</sup>PC) combines all the advantages of the simple concept of MPC together with the fixed switching frequency characteristic of PWM algorithms. In particular this work focuses on the Indirect Matrix Converter (IMC), where the tight coupling between rectifier stage and inverter stage has to be taken into account in the M<sup>2</sup>PC design. This paper proposes an M<sup>2</sup>PC solution, suitable for IMC, with an optimal switching pattern to emulate the desired waveform quality features of Space Vector Modulation (SVM). In the optimal pattern, the switching sequences of the rectifier stage and inverter stage are rearranged in order to always achieve zero-current switching on the rectifier stage, thus simplifying its commutation strategy. In addition, the optimal pattern enables M<sup>2</sup>PC to produce sinusoidal source current, sinusoidal output current and maintain all desirable characteristics of MPC.",

The second step consists in designing the control strategy; the paper will show that the results are largely improved if all converters are considered simultaneously.

In fact a modulation algorithm, based on the cost function ratio for different output vectors, is inherently included in the predictive control algorithm. In particular the case of a Shunt Active Filter is investigated and the converter topology, its analytical modeling and its control implementation are described in details. The cost function-based modulator is introduced and its effectiveness on reducing the current ripple is demonstrated. The proposed approach provides a straightforward and effective single loop control solution, maintaining an excellent dynamic performance despite the modulated output and it is self-synchronizing with the grid. Significant results obtained by experimental testing are reported and commented.",

      "abstract": "A new method for electrical motor drive self-commissioning, with elastic couplings and backlash, is presented. The heuristic algorithm particle swarm optimization (PSO) has been used for the identification and optimization of parameters. Initially, a model-based identification procedure is performed to evaluate the parameters of the system. Then, the parameters of a proportional-integral-derivative (PID)-based controller are optimized by using a time-domain performance criterion. Experimental results, obtained by testing three different laboratory permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drive prototypes, are also presented to confirm the validity of the proposed approach.",
