      "abstract": "This paper presents an effective Energy Management System (EMS) that allows Microgrids and polynegative plants to estimate the possible incomes deriving from the participation to the Ancillary Service Market (ASM) and Day Ahead Market (DAM). Since the electricity market requests strongly depends on real-time contingencies, and hence on the Transmission System Operator (TSO) requirements, a statistically based method is implemented. Specifically, the optimization is split into two steps. In the first step, the optimal power dispatch of the involved units is computed, and the possible DAM and proposals are identified. Then, a Monte Carlo approach is implemented to extract TSO decisions based on a user selected success percentage. Hence, for every extraction, the second step dispatches the units and computes the costs/revenues. The outcome is a Probability Density Function (PDF) of expenditure/incomes, whose analysis enables to evaluate the incomes deriving from ASM participation. To assess the effectiveness of the EMS implemented, two tests are performed on a real microgrid. Precisely, the comparison of the optimization outcomes when ASM participation is enabled or not is performed. The obtained results highlight that ASM participation definitely increases the incomes with respect to the case in which ASMs are not allowed.",

      "abstract": "The Energy Communities (EC) framework facilitates the active engagement of energy entities. It brings about a fundamental shift in the energy sector by effectively managing Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) and advancing a decentralized energy system. The implementation of this technology allows the electrification of rural or mountainous regions by addressing the obstacles associated with power grid maintenance through substantial restructuring of the underlying energy distribution framework. The present review aimed to investigate and examine the significance of EC structures and to start an inclusive foundation for the broader implementation of EC for energy decentralization to figure out the research gaps and ensure that Machine Learning (ML) based solutions are essential tools to study and further discussed the several ML-based algorithms based on their objectives. Moreover, a comprehensive literature review is conducted to compare the possible strategies and tools that could be implemented in EC. Furthermore, different solution tools are organized based on their advantages, such as Demand Response (DR), forecasting, and load management goals. Hence, it can be inferred that Reinforcement Learning (RL) methodologies exhibit considerable potential in the control field. In contrast, supervised and unsupervised approaches are essential in predicting tasks. Based on the existing knowledge, the present study can conclude that ML-based solution methods are of significant importance for developing an effective energy decentralization platform.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes the implementation of a receding horizon procedure to insert accurate and periodically updated Photovoltaic (PV) power production forecasts into an Energy Management System (EMS). This allows the EMS to compute the optimal scheduling of the dispatchable units of a Microgrid (MG) or polygenerative plant to minimize costs. The PV forecasts are obtained as outcomes of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). To allow reproducibility, the RNN is developed so that it requires input data available on open repositories and accessible with a timeliness consistent with the application. The RNN is used to input PV forecasts to the EMS. Two approaches to feed the EMS are compared: the first one hourly updates the PV forecasts and then launches a run of the EMS to dispatch the units for the next 23 hours. Then, only the control action related to the following hour are considered, and the other ones are discarded. The process is replicated hourly, giving origin to a receding horizon strategy. The second approach receives at midnight the PV forecasts for the next 23 hours and the EMS is run daily to dispatch the units. The effectiveness of the approaches is validated on historical data of a real MG comparing them with the ideal conditions, in which the PV forecast is exact.",

      "abstract": "This paper introduces a receding horizon method designed to integrate updated Photovoltaic (PV) power generation forecasts into an effective Energy Management System (EMS). At first, three RNN PV-based forecasting algorithms are compared to find the best architecture based on evaluation metrics, and the most accurate is utilized to estimate the PV power production. Secondly, the best-performing algorithm feeds into the EMS PV power production data. In addition, the feeding process compares two approaches. In the first one, PV forecasts are updated every hour, and the EMS is run to optimize dispatch decisions for the upcoming 23 hours. In the second method, the PV forecast is received at midnight, and the EMS optimizes decisions. The proposed joint approach is verified using an accurate EMS and by comparing the results with the real PV power data benchmark. Hence, the results indicate that the dispatching of units can be accurately predicted using the proposed forecasting techniques, with the hourly update approach yielding the most precise outcomes.",

      "abstract": "The progressive replacement of conventional power plants equipped with Synchronous Generators (SGs) by Inverter-based Resources (IBRs), like Photovoltaic (PV), Wind Turbine (WT) and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs) power plants, introduces challenges related to the availability of frequency and voltage regulation resources. To address the primary frequency regulation (PFR) needs, Transmission System Operators (TSOs) have introduced dedicated grid code attachments allowing IBRs to contribute to PFR. Moreover, also the converters connected to High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) links may participate in PFR. This study, conducted in collaboration with Terna, the Italian TSO, assesses the impact of HVDC converters and IBRs on the PFR capability of the Italian transmission network, with a focus on a potentially critical market zone in the 2030 year. The analysis considers two scenarios: i) the participation of SGs, IBRs, and two HVDC links (HVDC2 and HVDC3) in PFR, and ii) an extended scenario including the additional contribution of HVDC-1. The analyzed contingency considers possible failures of conventional or wind turbine Generating Units (Gus), single or coupled AC lines or single HVDC modules. In both scenarios, frequency containment actions successfully limited the steady-state frequency deviation within ± 500[mHz], with HVDC-1 further improving frequency containment capacity.",

      "abstract": "The decarbonization of the energy sector represents a challenge that requires new tools and approaches of analysis. This paper aims to demonstrate the fundamental role that geographical distributed real-time co-simulations (GD-RTDS) can play in this regard. To this end, three different case studies have been analyzed with GD-RTDS, covering a wide range of applications for the energy sector decarbonization: (a) implementation of Renewable Energy Communities for supporting the share increase of Renewable Energy Sources, (b) the integration and management of Onshore Power Supply, and (c) the integration of a forecasting tool for the management of the Electric Vehicle charging. The performed experiments included fully simulated components, together with (power) hardware-in-the-loop and software-in-the-loop elements. These components have been simulated in different laboratory facilities in Italy and Germany, all operating in a synchronized manner under the presented geographically-distributed setup. The results show that the proposed architecture is flexible enough to be used for modeling all the different case studies; moreover, they highlight the significant contribution that the GD-RTDS methodology can give in informing and driving energy transition policies and the fundamental role of power systems to spearhead the complete decarbonization of the energy sector.",

      "abstract": "Italian generation scenario, as many others, is foreseeing the replacement of conventional Synchronous Generators (SGs) in favour of Renewable Energy Sources (RES), thus leading to a reduction of the overall system inertia. This paper provides a techno-economic methodology for the estimation of the amount of additional inertia that will be needed in the Italian Transmission Network in the 2030 scenario, in order to limit the Rate of Change of Frequency (RoCoF) within sustainable limits. Moreover, the algorithm optimally distributes Synthetic Inertia (SI) contributions from RES and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs) and the installation of new Synchronous Compensators (SCs) among the Italian market areas. The method is designed to be sufficiently simple to process a significant number of working scenarios and the relevant quantity of information owned by the TSO. Nevertheless, the results have shown to be highly accurate as demonstrated by comparison with detailed time domain simulations.",

      "abstract": "In the framework of the increasing penetration of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) in the energy sector, photovoltaic (PV) power production grasps a central role. However, the intermittency and variability of PV production pose significant challenges in ensuring a stable and economically efficient operation of power systems. In this framework, this paper proposes a comparison among structurally tuned Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) aimed at nowcasting the PV active power production of a real medium-size PV plant one hour ahead. Moreover, the usefulness of the introduction of the decomposition in the seasonal, trend, and residual components of the involved meteorological variables in the feature vector is addressed. The nowcasting abilities are compared using dedicated evaluation metrics for the original dataset, which includes meteorological variables and PV data, and a further dataset that is created, merging the original dataset with the three components of all the meteorological variables. Outcomes confirm the ability of LSTM RNNs in modeling long-term dependencies and learning PV power production changes, driving to Root Mean Square Errors of approximately 3 kW for an 81 kWp PV plant. Moreover, results demonstrate that the introduction of the decomposition of the involved meteorological variables in the feature vector allows to halve the range of percentage errors.",

      "abstract": "Precise Photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting tools are needed to integrate PV into the new framework of the energy sector. Also, the related intermittent and random nature needs to be appropriately considered. In this context, this paper examines various machine learning algorithms used for one hour ahead forecasting of PV power production. Specifically, the performances of two Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks, a Gradient Boost Machine (GBM) model and an Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) model, are compared. Six years of data are retrieved from the 81 kW PV power plant in the Savona campus of the University of Genoa and are used to train and test the algorithms. The performances of all the algorithms are compared over the original dataset, composed of meteorological variables linked with the PV production, a dataset using seasonal and trend decomposition (STL) of the meteorological variables, and some reduced datasets that mimic the situation in which some of the features are not available at least for some time steps. By comparing the results through different case studies, it can be justified that the XGB outperforms the other algorithms and the STL decomposition is helpful in increasing the performance of the model.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes a communication less control and power management architecture for a hybrid diesel-storage Microgrid. The intrinsic differences between the Diesel Generator (DG) and a Voltage Source Inverter (VSI) interfacing the storage system with the microgrid distribution system imposes the definition of dedicated control and power management strategies in order to guarantee voltage and frequency regulation in islanded operation. For this reason, a dedicated control approach is defined in the present article and supported by some analytical considerations in order to demonstrate the frequency stability and the correct active power sharing among the sources. Finally, the proposed approach is validated by means of detailed simulations carried out using DIgSILENT PowerFactory ® in order to account for a detailed modelling of the system dynamics. The results highlight the good and stable operations of the proposed Microgrid control architecture.",

The control strategy is based on model-predictive control (MPC), a model-based control that is widely adopted for the regulation of linear and nonlinear dynamical systems in various fields of application. The MPC is applied in a decentralized formulation, where only local measurements are necessary. The performances of the proposed control strategy are assessed by means of simulations on a Western Electricity Coordinating Council test case network and on the 39-Bus New England network. The results highlight both the good behavior of the MPC control technique, even in conditions that traditional emergency control would not support, and the robustness of the proposed structure against power system modeling approximations.",

Being able to regulate their power production faster than any other form of conventional source, they are extremely valuable in compensating stochastic power fluctuations deriving from renewable energy sources in large-scale electrical grids, preserving grid stability, etc. In this context, gas turbines' dynamic performance plays a key role and it needs to be enhanced (however preserving the machine lifetime at the same time). Nonlinear model based control systems can effectively deal with this problem, exploiting the system structure to obtain optimal dynamic performance. Therefore, this paper aims at developing a sliding mode model based control for gas turbines. The results obtained from its application on a heavy duty Ansaldo gas turbine model (AE94.3A4) are compared to the ones obtained to the traditional control employed in these applications.",

      "abstract": "Model-based control techniques have been gaining more and more interest these days. These complex control systems are mostly based on theories, such as feedback linearization, model predictive control, adaptive and robust control. In this paper the latter approach is investigated, in particular, sliding mode (SM) control is analyzed. While several works on the description and application of SM control on single-input single-output systems can easily be found, its application on multi-input multi-output systems is not examined in depth at the same level. Hence, this work aims at formalizing some theoretical complements about the necessary conditions for the feasibility of the SM control for multi-input-multi-output systems. Furthermore, in order to obtain the desired performance from the control system, a method for parameter tuning is proposed in the particular case in which the relative degree of the controlled channels is equal to one. Finally, a simple control problem example is shown with the aim of stressing the benefits derived from the application of the theoretical complements described here.",

      "abstract": "The increasing penetration of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) and, more in general, of converter connected power generation is progressively reducing the overall inertia of the electricity system introducing new challenges in the network Frequency Support (FS). Therefore, FS strategies for RES are becoming an important aspect to be developed in order to en-sure the secure operation of the electricity power grid. The aim of the present paper is to propose an innovative approach for the inertial emulation of Wind Turbine Generators (WTGs) in order to ensure a positive effect on the system frequency avoiding unstable operations of the WTG and reducing the negative impact of the rotor speed recovery on the secondary frequency drop. Moreover, the paper provides a detailed definition of the triggering logics adopted to activate and deactivate the FS making it suitable for implementation in available industrial controllers. The proposed controller is firstly tested on a simplified configuration to show its enhanced performances with respect to previously developed approaches. Then, simulations are carried out in a more realistic network to assess the positive impact of the controller on the system frequency. Results highlighted a 40% reduction of the system Rate of Change of Frequency while the frequency deviation at the transient nadir is improved by 35%.",

      "abstract": "More and more research has been developed on model based control techniques in recent times. These complicated control systems have the foundations laid on theories such as: Model Predictive Control, Feedback Linearization, Adaptive and Robust Control. The last approach is studied here, in particular the Sliding Mode (SM) Control is investigated. While a huge number of papers rotates around the description and application of SM control on single-input single-output (SISO) systems, the general theory of multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems is not analyzed so thoroughly. Therefore, the goal of this paper is to identify the conditions necessary to realize the SM control for MIMO systems. In addition, in order to obtain the desired performance from the control system, a method for its parameter tuning is illustrated. In the end, a mere example is shown with the purpose of comparing the performance of the proposed approach with the same controller conventionally tuned.",

      "abstract": "The electromagnetic transients caused by lightning events are one of the most known causes of faults in the transmission lines. Many papers focused their attention on the evaluation of the effects caused by lightning events on a transmission line, but an overall analysis that takes into account, a real power system is rare to be found. In this paper, the analysis of electromagnetic transients in a connection between a power plant and large power grid is presented with a high detail of the high frequency model for each power system element. In particular, overhead lines, cables, transformers and surge arresters are modelled taking into account all the electromagnetic aspects. The simulations are performed using the well-known code PSCAD-EMTDC, taking into account, different scenarios for the lightning events, and the results show the behaviour of cables and transformers when are subjected to the aforementioned electromagnetic transients with a high level of detail.",

      "abstract": "The achievement of the so-called 2020 targets requested by the European Union (EU) has determined a significant growth of proposals of solutions and of technical projects aiming at reducing the CO<inf>2</inf> emissions and increasing the energy efficiency, as well as the penetration of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) in the electric network. As many of them ask for funding from the EU itself, there is the necessity to define a methodology to rank them and decide which projects should be sponsored to obtain the maximum effect on the EU 2020 targets. The present paper aims at (i) defining a set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to compare different proposals, (ii) proposing an analytical methodology to evaluate the defined KPIs and (iii) evaluating the maximum impact that the considered action is capable of producing. The proposed methodology is applied to a set of possible interventions performed on a benchmark transmission network test case, in order to show that the defined indicators can be either calculated or measured and that they are useful to rank different \"smarting actions\".",

      "abstract": "This paper focuses on the modeling of wind turbines equipped with direct drive permanent magnet synchronous generators for fundamental frequency power system simulations. Specifically, a procedure accounting for the system active power losses to initialize the simulation starting from the load flow results is proposed. Moreover, some analytical assessments are detailed on typical control schemes for fully rated wind turbine generators, thereby highlighting how active power losses play a fundamental role in the effectiveness of the wind generator control algorithm. Finally, the paper proposes analytical criteria to design the structure and the parameters of the regulators of the wind generator control scheme. Simulations performed with Digsilent Power Factory validated the proposed procedure, highlighting the impact of active power losses on the characterization of the initial steady state and that the simplifying assumptions done in order to synthesize the controllers are consistent with the complete modeling performed by the aforementioned power system simulator.",

      "abstract": "Microgrids (MGs) may represent a solution in the near future to many problems in the energy and electric world scenarios; such as pollution, high reliability, efficiency and so on. In particular, MGs' capability to work in an islanded configuration represents one of their most interesting features in terms of the improvement of the reliability of the system, the integration of renewable energy sources and the exploitation of the quick response and flexibility of power electronic devices in a stand-alone system. In order to study and validate innovative solutions and control strategies for islanded operation, there is a need to develop models for MG structures that can be reliable and sufficiently simple to be used for the purpose of the design and validation of innovative control systems. This paper proposes a simplified, first harmonic model for a generic structure of MG characterized by its use of only electronic power converter interfaced generation. The main advantages of the proposed method lie in the model's simplicity and its reduced solving time, thanks to the limited number of necessary parameters to describe the system. Moreover, the developed formulation allows the avoidance of specific (and often licensed) software to simulate the system. The performances of the proposed model have been validated by means of a comparative analysis of the results obtained against a more accurate representation of the system performed in the power system CAD-electromagnetic transient and DC (PSCAD-EMTDC) environment, which allows for the representation of each component with a very high level of detail. Such comparison has been performed using the University of Genoa Savona Campus Smart Polygeneration Microgrid testbed facility, due to the availability of all the necessary numerical values.",

The dynamic performances of a gas generating units are limited by the combustion chamber dynamics where sudden temperature variation may lead to undesired and dangerous phenomena. The FBL application will allow introducing an ideal decupling of the regulated channels so that power variation will have a minimal impact on the combustion chamber temperature obtaining a smoother and quicker response to reference changes in comparison with a tradition, PID based control. The proposed FBL controller will be also tested in presence of model and parameters uncertainties in order to verify the robustness of the proposed control technique.",

The interest in such a methodology lays in the fact that recently Transmission/Distribution System Operators (TSOs/DSOs) have extended the requirements for the connection of renewable generation to their electricity networks beyond the only supply of active power, requiring ancillary services too. It is then a primary necessity for the Companies which operate in the market of large photovoltaic plants to have a simple but effective tool to verify the compliance of a proposed plant layout with specific TSO requirements (which vary from country to country) in order to support the bidding and preliminary design phase of the project. After an overview of the typical layout of large photovoltaic plants, the proposed methodology is fully described. In order to verify its reliability, the method is validated against exact load flow calculations on a test case photovoltaic plant layout. In the light of the good results achieved by the methodology validation, the last part of the paper proposes an application to infer the power plant capability and the compliance check with reference to specific TSOs requirements.",

The technique is firstly described as a general tool; subsequently, the chosen model of the power system is detailed together with the specific requirements to be met by the control algorithm. Finally, the application of MPC strategy to a WECC (Western Electricity Coordinating Council) test case network shows that the effects of a contingency, that would bring the system to instability without any external action, are mitigated by the control action, leading the network to a new working point, as close as possible to the previous one and, most of all, without exceeding the stability limits.",

The aim of the present work is to introduce an innovative optimized control strategy to exploit the reactive power resource generated by photovoltaic plants in order to improve the quality and efficiency of the low/medium voltage distribution network. Here, a methodology to define the optimal reactive power reference for every photovoltaic unit of the network is presented in order to pursue a well-defined goal, such as the minimization of the Joule losses or the voltage support. Such reference signals are then provided to the photovoltaic control systems that will guarantee the decoupling between the reactive power channel and the active power one, thanks to the use of the FeedBack Linearization (FBL) control technique. The problem is here formulated in a general way, therefore it can be extended to any possible grid configuration and test case scenario. © 2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "This article proposes an advanced non-linear control algorithm to manage active power and voltage provided by a synchronous generator. The algorithm is based on the so-called feedback linearization theory, which relies on the central concept to algebraically transform non-linear systems dynamics into fully or partly linear ones, so that linear control techniques can be applied. Starting from the basic (electrical, magnetic, and mechanical) machine equations, a suitable state transformation is introduced in order to apply the feedback linearization block to the generator model. A regulation scheme is then derived, which receives as inputs the measure and reference signals of both the electric power and the voltage at the generator side and produces as outputs the physical inputs of the machine, i.e., the mechanical torque and the field voltage. Particular attention is devoted to both the linearization process, where internal dynamics and stability studies play an important role, and to the design of the two (power and voltage) decoupled regulators. Several simulations are finally performed in order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach and to highlight its main advantages and drawbacks with respect to the traditional P-V synchronous generator control strategy. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a model for the analysis of internal faults of synchronous generators with multiple parallel connection paths for phase. Several kinds of faults between different portions of the stator windings (and ground, if the case) can be described in the subtransient time frame. Data necessary for the model derive from the electromagnetic design of the machine, as well as from details on equivalent parameters of the external grid and from the neutral connection characteristics. Such modeling procedure allows accurate insight of currents in windings and terminals, exploring each possible fault configuration. In the second part of this work, the developed model will be applied to assess the validity and to define possible improvements of conventional protection configurations against internal faults.

      "abstract": "This study proposes a new control scheme to manage active and reactive power injections into the distribution grids provided by photovoltaic (PV) generating units. Such scheme is derived by resorting to the so-called 'feedback linearisation' theory, which relies on the central concept to algebraically transform non-linear systems dynamics into fully or partly linear ones, so that linear control techniques can be applied. To do this, a suitable state transformation is required, in order to simplify the form of the power system to be controlled. The developed scheme receives as input the reference signal for the PV unit voltage (generated by a maximum power point tracker controller) and the one for the desired reactive power and produces as output the modulating signal of the grid interface pulse width modulation inverter. A detailed simulation campaign on a medium voltage grid connected PV power plant is performed in the PSCAD-EMTDC electromagnetic environment, in order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm and to highlight its main advantages with respect to traditional regulation methodologies. © 2012 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.",

      "abstract": "This paper is focused on the evaluation of the benefits (environmental/technical) expected from the improvement of transmission and distribution infrastructures with the introduction of specific state-of-the-art technologies. This issue is presently much debated both at industrial and at scientific level, since worldwide measures are taken to lower the environmental impact of energy supply systems, in particular with regard to climate change [1 - 3]. Grids can be renewed by resorting basically to six interventions: 1. Replacement/refurbishment of power components; 2. Wide area measurement, monitoring and control systems (WAMS/WACS), upgrading protection and control devices for communication; 3. Increase of voltage level; 4. Installation of power quality devices (Distribution Networks); 5. High voltage direct current transmission systems - HVDC (line and forced commutated); 6. Flexible AC transmission systems - FACTS (Transmission Networks). In this work, the attention is concentrated on the application of FACTS to modern networks and the quantification of their impact on the achievement of the EU energy targets for the year 2020 [4], including improved efficiency, improved renewable generation penetration and improved environmental compatibility (basically linked to CO<inf>2</inf>emissions reduction). Our attention will focus on the use of FACTS devices and the installation of newer and more efficient components. We won't deal with the problem of increasing the rate voltage as the proposed model for the network is in \"per unit\", so it is valid for every voltage level. Three main scenarios are investigated: in the first one, the aim is to find an optimal condition of the power system, in which the insertion of FACTS can contribute to increase the overall efficiency; in the second one, the capability of FACTS to enable the integration of a certain amount of power generated via renewable resources into a grid operating in a critical asset (transmission lines at their capacity limits) is analyzed; in the third one, the optimization of the generating scheduling of different power plants connected to the grid to obtain an optimum power set-points configuration for each unit from an environmental point of view is discussed. In this last analysis scenario, one has to characterize the different power plants emissions and relate them with the power produced, then generate the set-points with an 'environmental oriented' dispatching procedure and employ FACTS to reach the desired configuration.",

Such methodology is based both on the identification of suitable \"performance (technical) indices\" to be used to rank the benefits brought by the different grid upgrading measures and on the definition of suitable \"test networks\", which can be employed as benchmarks to perform the numerical evaluation of the introduced indices. Then, a procedure is presented in order to determine and compare the quantitative effect of each single corrective action on T&D power grids.

      "abstract": "The recent trend of wind power generator is to use variable speed wind turbines coupled with Direct Driven Permanent Magnet (DDPM) Synchronous Generators. This configuration offers a considerable flexibility in design and operation, as the output of the generator is delivered to the grid through a fully controlled frequency converter. In this paper, a new control strategy for this generation unit is presented, based on the Feed Back Linearization (FBL), a technique that allows both decoupling and linearization of a non linear multiple input multiple output (MIMO) system. The mathematical model for the control synthesis is derived, and simulation results are presented in order to show how the flexibility of the DDPM Wind Generator can be fully exploited thanks to the independent control of each variable performed with our approach. Moreover, both controller synthesis and system operation can be greatly simplified, thus making it easier to integrate this wind energy conversion system (WECS) in modern day smart grids.",

      "abstract": "Investigation of faults in electric power systems is of primary relevance for planning and operation: contingency occurrence analysis finds, for instance, specific application in protection system design, security assessment and economical impact evaluation. Loss of generation is surely one of the most severe outage affecting power systems: all the aspects quoted above are linked to generation management throughout the grid. Concerning the protection system, in particular, it is essential to counteract generator faults efficiently both to prevent cascading events in the electric grid, and to avoid severe damages to generators and related long out of service. Standard approaches for analysis of network faults are well known, whereas additional work could be specifically done for generator fault modelling and detection. From this point of view, internal faults are of particular concern as unexpected fault paths and current amounts could sometime arise, leading to protection malfunctioning and misdetection [1-2]. In literature, some models have been set up [3-7], but further developments can be done especially for what concerns input parameters, not always easily available, and sensitivity to fault location. The paper proposes an extended model of the synchronous machine suitable for a generalised analysis of internal faults, accounting for stator windings with multiple paralleled paths for phase. The main aims and properties of the here presented simulation model are: input parameters as derived from either the electromagnetic design or experimental identification of the generator; fault current computation for variable location, along a winding path, of internal (single or multiple) phase to ground, phase to neutral or phase to phase faults; evidence of selective contributions to fault currents from the different paths of the stator windings; comparison and link between internal fault currents and ones detected by conventional protection schemes.",

The control algorithm has been applied to a real MV grid-connected PV power plant and several simulations have been performed in order to analyze the behavior of the system and to verify the effectiveness of the adopted regulation.

      "abstract": "The paper presents a restoration procedure for power systems, useful for recovery entities acquisition under a liberalized arrangement. The basic concept is that a black-outed network can be restored starting from a source available at a node, by sequentially connecting the adjacent nodes, that is buses that can be reached by closing a single line. The entities connected to adjacent nodes (generation or load) represent the \"targets\" of the procedure, whose main goals are to restore nodes as soon as possible in order to save time, so to minimize the unsupplied energy. These objectives are pursued while maintaining the significant quantities (voltage, current, frequency) inside their range at each stage of the strategy. The main characteristic of the presented procedure is its flexibility that allows the search of alternative paths when some of the quantities are out of range. Results are presented with reference to a 30-buses test system.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes two novel techniques for including contingencies in OPF-based electricity market computations and for the estimation of a \"system-wide\" available transfer capability (SATC). The OPF problem formulation includes voltage stability constraints and a loading parameter in order to ensure a proper stability margin for the market solution. Two methods are proposed. The first technique is an iterative approach and computes an SATC value based on an N-1 contingency criterion for an initial optimal operating condition, to then solve an OPF problem for the worst contingency case; this process is repeated until the changes in the SATC values are below a minimum threshold. The second approach solves a reduced number of OPF problems associated with contingency cases according to a ranking based on a power transfer sensitivity analysis of the transmission lines. Both methods are tested on a 6-bus system and on a realistic 129-bus Italian network model considering supply and demand side bidding. Local marginal prices and nodal congestion prices resulting from the proposed solutions as well as comparisons with results obtained by means of a standard OPF technique are also presented and discussed. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Additional strategies are proposed for PMU positioning with a N-1 contingency criterion, for both line and measurement device losses.

The dynamic behaviour of the area to be reduced is provided by regulators of LTC transformers feeding a static load. First it is assumed a suitable topology of the 132 kV area and a procedure for reporting static load expressions at the ideal primary winding of the transformers is defined. With the hypothesis of a complete parameter knowledge of the sub-transmission area, an approximated nodal reduction is actuated. Then a modal equivalent is also determined by assuming a dynamic coherence of the tap changer regulator dynamics. The complete procedure is finally validated and criticised by some simulations on this kind of sub-transmission configuration area typical of the Italian network.",

Reference is made to the Lyapounov exponent and bifurcation theories to provide extension of steady-state based indices for voltage stability, this time taking care of system differential equations, to a continuous monitoring of system distance from collapse during transients caused by step perturbations. Theoretical results are validated on the IEEE 30-node test network, accounting for the effect of typically committed components and regulation loops, such as synchronous generators, and voltage dependent loads under load tap changing transformers. Comparison with traditional modal analysis is also provided for sake of completeness.",

      "abstract": "Most electric companies are facing structural changes due to increasing economic pressure towards deregulation and creation of power markets. One of the most critical issues still remaining open in this context is providing ancillary services competitively. The main focus of the paper is the implementation of a framework for the valuation of ancillary services that market participants are selling or buying, so that the optimal prices at which exchanging each service will be more easily agreed by the parties. The quantifying method proposed in the paper is based on the relationship between the availability (the use) of the generic ancillary service and the state (the transition) the system is presently experimenting. The efilcacy of the method is tested with reference to different active power services, given by spinning reserve and frequency regulation.",

Account is taken of specific models for interconnecting networks and loads, which are supplied by TCUL transformers equipped with an automatic tap ratio regulator. The analysis leads to an equivalent TCUL transformer, feeding a constant current load, which affects the rest of the system in the same way as the original transformers; this is acknowledged by comparing, both in steady-state and dynamic conditions, voltage and current, and therefore active and reactive power, at common specific buses in the original and equivalenced system. Two test cases have been created, showing acceptable similarities between the original system and the equivalenced system. Such promising outcomes seem to ensure the opportunity to analyse large power systems, leading to satisfactory results, for interesting quantities, without a loss of generality and excessive time-consuming procedures.",

While the former ones are based on the power flow equations, the latter use system algebraic and differential equations; there might be a correlation between the two forms if linearized models are examined. In this paper, several load flow Jacobians are defined and correlated to the linearized system state matrix to show under which conditions there might be contemporaneous singularity. Several cases related to simple electrical systems including elements (static loads under LTC transformers, induction motors and aggregate dynamic loads) that may prove critical for system voltage stability are analytically considered, evidencing how these relationships can be achieved.",

      "abstract": "The topic covered by this paper is the first swing transient stability of synchronous machines connected to a power system when short circuit faults occur. The main goal of the study is to explore the selective influence on transient stability limits of several factors including pre-fault conditions, generator modeling, regulating devices and transmission system characteristics. In particular, improvements deriving from saturation description and benefits offered by a static exciter with high initial response, static var systems for reactive compensation and turbine energy control through fast valving actuation are evaluated and compared. The stability analysis is based on numerical integration of the system dynamic equations and the critical fault clearing time has been assumed as reference parameter for discussion of results. © 1988 IEEE",

      "abstract": "An expert system approach is proposed to support the operator of a control center in decision making during emergency operation of an electric power system. The attention is focused on the elimination of abnormal operating conditions caused by excessive power flow in certain lines. The control objective is to return the line flows to their normal limits by acting on the synchronous generators. The knowledge necessary to solve the overload problem is formulated with regards to the most feasible methods for online applications. KEE is used for the development and implementation of the knowledge base. The procedure for alleviating line overloads is translated into a set of production rules, which are interpreted by the inference engine. An example of the system's application is presented and the functioning of the expert system is shown through a user-friendly representation which makes use of images for each physical variable of the process.",
