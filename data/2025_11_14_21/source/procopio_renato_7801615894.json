      "abstract": "Photovoltaic (PV) systems in urban environments are a very suitable solution for electricity generation but can be jeopardized in cases of increased air pollution. The main idea of this paper is to determine the regularity of PV modules soiling variations during the heating season in the City of Niš (Serbia) and consequently to predict the maximum available power for PV inverter operation. The maximum reduction of PV modules' electrical parameters due to soiling was measured 45 days since the experiment began, after almost absolute precipitation absence for 25 days. The functioning of two control algorithms for single-stage grid inverters was tested in laboratory conditions by utilization of programmable DC sources and by the emulation of PV string-measured I-V characteristics. It was noted that the usual method for maximum power estimation does not give good results, because in the case of significant soiling can lead to inverter disconnection and interruption of the operation. Therefore, the soiling ratio was introduced to predict the available PV module power for a specific day with great certainty. To provide reliable operation of grid-forming inverters, the structure of their primary controller was modified by a specific saturation method for reference currents.",

      "abstract": "In the last decades, the introduction of intermittent renewable energy sources has transformed the operation of power systems. In this framework, ancillary service markets (ASMs) play an important role, due to their contribution in supporting system operators to balance demand and supply and managing real-time contingencies. Usually, ASMs require that energy is committed before actual participation, hence scheduling systems of plants and microgrids are required to compute the dispatching program and bidding strategy before needs of the market are revealed. Since possible ASM requirements are given as input to scheduling systems, the chance of accessing accurate estimates may be helpful to define reliable dispatching programs and effective bidding strategies. Within this context, this paper proposes a methodology to estimate the revenue range of energy exchange proposals in the ASM. To this end, the possible revenues are discretized into ranges and a classification pattern recognition algorithm is implemented. Modeling is performed using extreme gradient boosting. Input data to be fed to the algorithm are selected because of relationships with the production unit making the proposal, with the location and temporal indication, with the grid power dispatch and with the market regulations. Different tests are set up using historical data referred to the Italian ASM. Results show that the model can appropriately estimate rejection and the revenue range of awarded bids and offers, respectively, in more than 82% and 70% of cases.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes an analytical method to solve the load flow problem for radial single and multi-feeder power distribution networks in three-phase balanced conditions. The Analytical Load Flow (ALF) formulation relies on a single assumption for the estimation of line losses and accounts for line susceptances. A set of comparative tests performed on a total active and passive 33 nodes benchmark network allowed showing that the accuracy of the proposed method is extremely high, if compared with the alternative numerical solution. Furthermore, a specific analysis is proposed to evaluate the impact of the approximation on the losses in the determination of the nodal voltage phasors. Finally, ALF is validated in a realistic scenario with high integration of Renewable Energy Sources (RESs), considering seasonal variations in production and consumption. In this context, it is shown that the proposed method outperforms existing approximate analytical approaches, such as the industrial voltage drop method. The ALF approach, being fully analytical, does not require any numerical solver and can be applied as a valid alternative to existing numerical and analytical methods in balanced multi-feeder networks.",

      "abstract": "The paper introduces a technical-economic methodology to estimate the additional inertia required in a Transmission Network for future scenarios and presents an algorithm to optimally dispatch it among different sources and interwork busbars. First, the amount of inertia is calculated to constrain the Rate of Change of Frequency (RoCoF) within sustainable limits. Then, such inertia is allocated accounting for the contributions from Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs), complemented by the deployment of Synchronous Compensators (SCs) across various nodes of a Transmission Network. The methodology underwent testing within the Italian Transmission Network, utilizing the informational support furnished by the Italian Transmission System Operator (TSO). Despite its simplicity, the results exhibit notable accuracy, validated through rigorous comparisons with detailed time-domain simulations. Moreover, the low computational cost of the method, allowed a statistical analysis considering all the hours of year 2030, to get information on the distributions of the quantities of interest.",

The effectiveness of RECs VI operation is assessed using an Optimal Power Flow (OPF) that considers distribution network operational limits.

      "abstract": "Lightning is a major risk for humans, animals, and electrical systems. Many researches focused on the fully developed events, such as the Return Stroke (RS) current, the emitted electromagnetic fields, and the phenomenon modeling. However, there is poor understanding regarding precursors, such as Preliminary Breakdown Pulses (PBP). PBP are the pulses before the first RS. Studying these pulses provides understanding into the initial event that triggers the process within the cloud. Sufficient measurement data and a reliable model of PBP help to forecast the lightning flash development and help creating effective protection systems, ultimately enhancing the safety and reliability of electrical infrastructure and minimizing the risk of damage from lightinings. The aim of this paper is to conduct an extensive literature review to identify sources of measured data of PBP and the available modeling methods. The first part provides a review of key existing experimental studies, discussing aspects such as measurement equipment, signals, data, identification algorithms, and statistical observations. The second part discusses the methods available for modeling PBP categorized into descriptive and physical models. Descriptive models focus on reconstructing the primary PBP features from measured data, while physical models aim to explore the underlying physical mechanisms of PBPs.",

The basic idea is to use the time domain waveforms of the overvoltages induced by lightning strikes on transmission or distribution lines as features to regress both the location and the channel base current peak of a lightning event. Starting from previous research findings, the performance of the method have been further increased by proposing three different DL models, working either in the frequency or in the time domain. All models are trained with data simulated with the Lightning Power Electromagnetic Simulator for Transient Overvoltages (LIGHT-PESTO). The performances of the methods are first assessed on the same test case as the one presented in a previously published paper to show their increased effectiveness. Then, the best performing model among the three is tested on a more realistic network to show that, even in presence of much more complex systems, its performances are not reduced.",

The hybrid electromagnetic model is considered to model the grounding system for the distribution poles.

The lightning-induced voltages across the insulator strings are estimated based on the Agrawal model, and the outage rate is assessed by means of the Monte Carlo method. Additionally, analysis considering protective techniques, such as implementing shield wires and surge arresters, is taken into account.

      "abstract": "The climate change of the last decades is causing an increase in the frequency of extreme event occurrences. Numerous studies confirm the link between extreme meteorological events and lightning activity. The possibility of having short-Term predictions of the intensity of lightning phenomena would allow the near-real-Time monitoring of the evolution of these events. Such knowledge would help in defining operational strategies to mitigate effects on the population and the infrastructure. In this context, this article proposes a multidisciplinary approach aiming at developing a regression algorithm to nowcast the density of cloud-To-ground lightning strokes 1 h in advance. The algorithm is developed on the basis of a joint combination of remote sensing data, numerical weather prediction model outcomes, and lightning observations. The possible dependence between the meteorological data and the density of lightning is estimated using Gaussian process regression models. Separate models are created for positive and negative strokes and for strokes occurrences over the land or sea. The experimental results indicate that the model quite accurately estimates low numbers of strokes, whereas larger numbers of strokes are estimated with higher errors. Nevertheless, their presence is correctly detected. This suggests the potential of the method as a processing tool to support the management of weather-related hazards.",

      "abstract": "The Energy Communities (EC) framework facilitates the active engagement of energy entities. It brings about a fundamental shift in the energy sector by effectively managing Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) and advancing a decentralized energy system. The implementation of this technology allows the electrification of rural or mountainous regions by addressing the obstacles associated with power grid maintenance through substantial restructuring of the underlying energy distribution framework. The present review aimed to investigate and examine the significance of EC structures and to start an inclusive foundation for the broader implementation of EC for energy decentralization to figure out the research gaps and ensure that Machine Learning (ML) based solutions are essential tools to study and further discussed the several ML-based algorithms based on their objectives. Moreover, a comprehensive literature review is conducted to compare the possible strategies and tools that could be implemented in EC. Furthermore, different solution tools are organized based on their advantages, such as Demand Response (DR), forecasting, and load management goals. Hence, it can be inferred that Reinforcement Learning (RL) methodologies exhibit considerable potential in the control field. In contrast, supervised and unsupervised approaches are essential in predicting tasks. Based on the existing knowledge, the present study can conclude that ML-based solution methods are of significant importance for developing an effective energy decentralization platform.",

      "abstract": "The ongoing replacement of traditional power plants with Photovoltaic (PV), Wind Turbine (WT) and Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) power plants will lead to problems of inertia shortage in future power systems. Thus, the provision of Synthetic Inertia (SI) by Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs) will be crucial in order to deliver effective Rate of Change of Frequency (RoCoF) mitigation actions. The present paper presents a methodology to assess the impact of IBRs on the available inertia in future power systems. The study, carried out in partnership with Terna, the Italian transmission system operator, focuses on a critical market zone in the 2030 Italian scenario. First, the availability of inertia by synchronous generators and already-installed Synchronous Compensators (SCs) is assessed, along with the need of inertia (i.e., the inertia necessary to limit the zonal RoCoF at the limit value following a reference contingency). If the need is larger than the availability, the intervention of IBRs is considered to limit the RoCoF. In particular, a sensitivity analysis is carried out varying both the limit value of RoCoF and the overloading capability of IBRs inverters, showing that the predominant SI contribution will be delivered by BESSs. Regarding RoCoF containment, if the limit value is set at 2 Hz/s IBRs are able to make the gap negative over the whole year. On the other hand, if a more stressful condition is considered (i.e., limit value set at 1 Hz/s), the installation of additional SCs may become necessary to make the inertia gap negative for the whole year under whatever IBRs overloading capability scenario.",

      "abstract": "Lightning represents a major hazard to humans, buildings, electrical and electronic installations. To date, the majority of investigations have concentrated on the Return Stroke (RS) phase of the lightning flash. Nonetheless, a significant gap persists in the comprehension of RS antecedents, particularly Preliminary Breakdown (PB) pulses, which manifest as a succession of transient signals occurring prior to the initiation of the first RS. Analyzing these initial pulse sequences yields critical insight into the processes that trigger electrical breakdown within thunderclouds. Accordingly, the acquisition of comprehensive measurement datasets and the development of robust models capable of characterizing PB may support the prediction of lightning flash progression and the formulation of more effective protection strategies. Within this framework, this study is intended to provide a survey of existing literature concerning PB data, examining aspects such as measurement instrumentation, recorded signals, data attributes, identification techniques, and statistical findings.",

The NG integrates a 21 kW Photovoltaic (PV) array and two 40 kWh Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS1 and BESS2). Firstly, a Mixed-Integer Quadratically Constrained Programming (MIQCP) Energy Management System (EMS) was implemented in MATLAB/YALMIP and solved with Gurobi, executing a dayahead optimization to minimize cost. Secondly, a simulation was carried out to test the behavior of the NG when undergoing a load increase contingency during islanded mode operation. To this purpose, the NG was implemented in MATLAB/Simulink Simscape. The EMS results highlighted that PV selfconsumption through BESSs is the best solution to minimize the operating costs of the facility. Dynamic simulation showed that the BESSs, by increasing the power output, are able to stop the frequency variation in the NG to 49.8 Hz, efficiently providing a frequency containment action.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes the implementation of a receding horizon procedure to insert accurate and periodically updated Photovoltaic (PV) power production forecasts into an Energy Management System (EMS). This allows the EMS to compute the optimal scheduling of the dispatchable units of a Microgrid (MG) or polygenerative plant to minimize costs. The PV forecasts are obtained as outcomes of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). To allow reproducibility, the RNN is developed so that it requires input data available on open repositories and accessible with a timeliness consistent with the application. The RNN is used to input PV forecasts to the EMS. Two approaches to feed the EMS are compared: the first one hourly updates the PV forecasts and then launches a run of the EMS to dispatch the units for the next 23 hours. Then, only the control action related to the following hour are considered, and the other ones are discarded. The process is replicated hourly, giving origin to a receding horizon strategy. The second approach receives at midnight the PV forecasts for the next 23 hours and the EMS is run daily to dispatch the units. The effectiveness of the approaches is validated on historical data of a real MG comparing them with the ideal conditions, in which the PV forecast is exact.",

      "abstract": "Purpose – This study aims to investigate the use of machine learning–based algorithms in the field of lightning stroke localization. This work is an important step ahead with respect to the research recently started by the authors, i.e. the possibility of locating a lightning discharge from the voltage induced on overhead transmission lines; more in detail it seeks new insights into the inclusion of both first and subsequent return strokes of negative cloud-to-ground flashes. Design/methodology/approach – This study uses a quantitative approach, using supervised learning techniques for a regression problem (data preprocessing, model selection, training, testing, validation or algorithm optimization). Data are collected from a dedicated lightning-induced overvoltage simulator and analyzed using a specific machine learning–based procedure developed and programmed by the authors. Findings – The results reveal significant improvements in localization accuracy for both first and subsequent strokes, with respect previous works, indicating that the novel approach is promising for future investigation with more complex power system configurations and the use of experimental data. These findings provide evidence that dedicated models for each type of stroke yield better performance, offering significant implications for the integration of machine learning–based lightning location systems into the existing power infrastructure. Originality/value – The proposed method is, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, entirely new and constitute an innovation with respect to the present literature, both of the same authors and of other research groups. In particular, a new preprocessing procedure of the voltage data is proposed, and the performances of different neural networks are evaluated, both for the first and the subsequent stroke. The application to both first and subsequent stroke is an innovation itself because it has not been proposed before.",

Numerical methods for their computation have been developed, mainly based on the superposition law as applied to consecutive rectilinear segments, properly oriented in order to create a tortuous path; however, such methods require a high computational effort, which may be unfeasible for realistic problems. As an alternative approach, this work introduces an equivalent tortuous function, which aims at taking into account the channel tortuosity in the EMF expressions produced by a vertical channel.

Secondly, the best-performing algorithm feeds into the EMS PV power production data. In addition, the feeding process compares two approaches. In the first one, PV forecasts are updated every hour, and the EMS is run to optimize dispatch decisions for the upcoming 23 hours. In the second method, the PV forecast is received at midnight, and the EMS optimizes decisions. The proposed joint approach is verified using an accurate EMS and by comparing the results with the real PV power data benchmark. Hence, the results indicate that the dispatching of units can be accurately predicted using the proposed forecasting techniques, with the hourly update approach yielding the most precise outcomes.",

      "abstract": "The progressive replacement of conventional power plants equipped with Synchronous Generators (SGs) by Inverter-based Resources (IBRs), like Photovoltaic (PV), Wind Turbine (WT) and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs) power plants, introduces challenges related to the availability of frequency and voltage regulation resources. To address the primary frequency regulation (PFR) needs, Transmission System Operators (TSOs) have introduced dedicated grid code attachments allowing IBRs to contribute to PFR. Moreover, also the converters connected to High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) links may participate in PFR. This study, conducted in collaboration with Terna, the Italian TSO, assesses the impact of HVDC converters and IBRs on the PFR capability of the Italian transmission network, with a focus on a potentially critical market zone in the 2030 year. The analysis considers two scenarios: i) the participation of SGs, IBRs, and two HVDC links (HVDC2 and HVDC3) in PFR, and ii) an extended scenario including the additional contribution of HVDC-1. The analyzed contingency considers possible failures of conventional or wind turbine Generating Units (Gus), single or coupled AC lines or single HVDC modules. In both scenarios, frequency containment actions successfully limited the steady-state frequency deviation within ± 500[mHz], with HVDC-1 further improving frequency containment capacity.",

The partial application of the Unscented Transform method, a mathematical tool that discretizes probability density functions, significantly reduces the number of simulations required for lightning performance assessments. The proposed hybrid approach is compared to the traditional one, which relies solely on the Monte Carlo method, with both approaches applied within a computational tool to estimate the lightning performance, considering both direct and indirect lightning strikes. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach can provide similar lightning performance estimates as the traditional method but with greater computational efficiency.",

      "abstract": "This article presents a new method to solve the inverse problem of reconstructing the lightning return-stroke current from measurements of the radiated magnetic field. Although the lightning channel is still assumed to be straight, vertical, and at a known distance from the sensors measuring the fields, no model or channel-base measurement of the current is required, so that, unlike previous approaches to this kind of inverse problem, several assumptions on the current propagation along the channel can be dropped. The method is formulated in the frequency domain and is based on a double Fourier series (DFS) representation of the unknown current as a function of two variables, i.e., the vertical coordinate and the frequency. The theoretical investigation results in an inversion algorithm, which is tested against simulated data in order to obtain some examples of current reconstruction.",

The VPA will improve the environmental and economic performance of prosumers with residential photovoltaic or other renewable energy systems by exploiting the energy storage availability of EVs in an effective way. The VPA for V2H services is applied to realistic residential single-family and multi-family housing test cases using real measured data.

      "abstract": "The energy transition is becoming one of the main challenges in recent years and it requires a fast discovery of new technologies and solutions to effectively integrate renewables in the electricity system. In this context, islanded AC Microgrids represent one of the most promising architectures, but they require smart and advanced control systems to allow fast and robust operations in all the possible operating scenarios. Among the advanced control techniques, Higher Order Sliding Mode control for power converters is one of the most promising solutions due to its ability to cope with model and parametric uncertainties without generating discontinuous control actions. This work presents the experimental validation of the approach proposed in a theoretical paper in which frequency and voltage controllers were defined that combined advantages of primary and secondary classic regulations. Such experimental campaign has been conducted at the Micro-grid and Smart-grid Research Lab of the Faculty of Electronic Engineering, University of Niš. Results show the correct behavior of the converters control in normal operation scenarios and the possibility to manage transitions between operating modes without any communication infrastructure among the generating units.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a tool that allows to perform an ex-ante estimation of the profitability to participate to the electric energy and service markets for a microgrid or a polygeneration power plant. The tool is the evolution of an Energy Management System (EMS) previously developed by the University of Genoa and Renantis Solutions Srl. Constraints are added to the original EMS to model the Ancillary Service Market (ASM) and Day Ahead Market (DAM) mechanisms in the framework of a planning tool that allows to get estimates of the microgrid/plant costs and revenues over a long-time horizon. As the market outcome strongly depends on the Transmission System Operator (TSO) acceptance/rejection of bids and offers, a statistical approach is proposed. The optimization process is split in two steps: the first one optimally dispatches the energy units and proposes DAM offers and ASM bid and offers over a specified time horizon. Then, a Monte Carlo method is launched; at each extraction the TSO acceptance/rejection of each ASM bid and offer is simulated and there is a second step of optimization in which the energy sources are optimally re-dispatched to meet the bidding program and so to avoid imbalance power exchange that would increase the energy cost. The cost/revenue is thus computed at each extraction. The result is the probability density function of the costs/revenues that allows to estimate the profitability of the participation to the electricity markets. One test performed on a real microgrid shows that the computational time needed to complete one iteration related to a time horizon of one month is approximately 20 s. Moreover, the comparison of the outcomes with two independent launches to define the set of bids and offers to be accepted in ASM demonstrates that the statistical analysis allows to avoid misleading conclusions on the costs/revenues. Consequently, the fact that the developed EMS allows to perform a statistical analysis in a reasonable time enables the possibility of comparing multiple scenarios and gives an indication related to the range of cost/revenues in which the microgrid/plant may incur. Finally, the computational efficiency of the proposed approach allows to conclude that the developed EMS is appropriate to perform a long-time horizon (of the order of magnitude of years) analysis and, at the same time, allows to model all the involved components with a high level of details.",

      "abstract": "In this article, a machine-learning-based model for the regression of cloud-to-ground lightning location and peak current from time-domain waveforms of lightning-induced voltage measurements on overhead transmission lines is presented. A principal component analysis (PCA) procedure is applied for extracting significant features and decreasing the dimension of the input vector. Then, a shallow neural network is trained with the results of the PCA. The obtained results show that the proposed approach can be the base for a tool able to regress lighting location with an accuracy comparable to or even better than traditional methods [i.e., lightning location system (LLS)] and provide a peak current estimate more accurate than LLS and more actual and widespread than direct tower measurements (which are limited to a reduced number of recorded events in some specific regions). Such a tool would also have significant advantages in terms of costs, since it would not require a dedicated instrumentation.",

This paper provides a techno-economic methodology for the estimation of the amount of additional inertia that will be needed in the Italian Transmission Network in the 2030 scenario, in order to limit the Rate of Change of Frequency (RoCoF) within sustainable limits. Moreover, the algorithm optimally distributes Synthetic Inertia (SI) contributions from RES and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs) and the installation of new Synchronous Compensators (SCs) among the Italian market areas. The method is designed to be sufficiently simple to process a significant number of working scenarios and the relevant quantity of information owned by the TSO. Nevertheless, the results have shown to be highly accurate as demonstrated by comparison with detailed time domain simulations.",

      "abstract": "The mass introduction of renewable energy sources (RESs) presents numerous challenges for transmission system operators (TSOs). The Italian TSO, Terna S.p.A., aims to assess the impact of inverter-based generation on system inertia, primary regulating energy and short-circuit power for the year 2030, characterized by a large penetration of these sources. The initial working point of the Italian transmission network has to be defined through load flow (LF) calculations before starting dynamical analyses and simulations of the power system. Terna 2030 development plan projections enable the estimation of active power generation and load for each hour of that year in each Italian market zone, as well as cross-zonal active power flows; this dataset differs from conventional LF assignments. Therefore, in order to set up a LF analysis for the characterization of the working point of the Italian transmission network, LF assignments have to be derived from the input dataset provided by Terna. For this purpose, this paper presents two methods for determining canonical LF assignments for each network bus, aligning with the available data. The methodologies are applied to a simplified model of the Italian network, but they are also valid for other transmission networks with similar topology and meet the future needs of TSOs. The methods are tested at selected hours, revealing that both approaches yield satisfactory results in terms of compliance with the hourly data provided.",

      "abstract": "In the framework of the increasing penetration of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) in the energy sector, photovoltaic (PV) power production grasps a central role. However, the intermittency and variability of PV production pose significant challenges in ensuring a stable and economically efficient operation of power systems. In this framework, this paper proposes a comparison among structurally tuned Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) aimed at nowcasting the PV active power production of a real medium-size PV plant one hour ahead. Moreover, the usefulness of the introduction of the decomposition in the seasonal, trend, and residual components of the involved meteorological variables in the feature vector is addressed. The nowcasting abilities are compared using dedicated evaluation metrics for the original dataset, which includes meteorological variables and PV data, and a further dataset that is created, merging the original dataset with the three components of all the meteorological variables. Outcomes confirm the ability of LSTM RNNs in modeling long-term dependencies and learning PV power production changes, driving to Root Mean Square Errors of approximately 3 kW for an 81 kWp PV plant. Moreover, results demonstrate that the introduction of the decomposition of the involved meteorological variables in the feature vector allows to halve the range of percentage errors.",

      "abstract": "The electric fields radiated by a lightning discharge may represent an important source of damage for electric and electronic equipment. Often, an analysis of such fields in the frequency domain is necessary and their frequency-domain expressions have always been evaluated by considering an infinite time-window and omitting the zero-frequency term coming from the static component of the fields. This work shows that, in order to take into proper account such component, the classical expressions of the electric fields in the frequency domain should be modified by including a distributional term. This aspect may strongly affect numerical algorithms such as the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), since the agreement between Fourier Transform (FT) and FFT is guaranteed only if the FT is a function. Starting from this issue, the present work proposes new frequency-domain expressions of the radial and vertical electric fields by assuming, more realistically, that the time window in which the fields are measured is finite. As a result, the new FT of each time-windowed field is wholly functional again, but it turns out to be modified with respect to its traditional expression.",

      "abstract": "By relying on suitable propagation models, lightning electromagnetic fields can be computed from the knowledge of the channel-base current (CBC) and of the attenuation function. While the CBC is measured by means of instrumented towers, a parametric attenuation function is usually assumed a priori and then compared with the measured fields in order to find optimal values for the CBC parameters. Unlike this approach, the present paper proposes a methodology for the reconstruction of the attenuation function whereby the latter is obtained as the solution of an inverse problem (while maintaining the same kind of input data). Moreover, for the sake of generality, the framework is formulated by considering possibly short time-windows, so that meaningful information can be recovered even when a complete recording of the lightning discharge process is not available. The inversion method is based on an iterative Tikhonov regularization procedure. The proposed approach is then applied to simulated data of electric and magnetic fields, as well as of CBC current, blurred by numerical noise in the time domain. The resulting algorithm turns out to provide a good accuracy in reconstructing a fictitious attenuation function. Finally, a short sensitivity analysis on the electromagnetic field noise and on the radial distance error is presented.",

The algorithm is developed using atmospheric variables retrieved from remote sensing, numerical weather prediction model outcomes and lightning location systems' data. Gaussian Process Regression is used to estimate the possible dependence among the available meteorological variables and the lightning activity. Separate models are created for positive and negative strokes and for strokes over land or sea areas. The performed tests suggest that the proposed model quite accurately estimates low numbers of strokes whereas larger numbers of strokes are estimated with errors, mostly of underestimation. Nonetheless, since the presence of strokes is correctly nowcasted, the detection of their presence may be considered a useful information for activities related to the weather hazard management.",

The traditional Q/V droop control approach faces difficulties in achieving proper reactive power distribution and maintaining voltage levels within permissible limits. To overcome these challenges, an innovative communication-less control called Q/V Dynamic Control (DC), which integrates boost and droop strategies, is introduced. The DC approach is presented detailing its control law and an analytic procedure is formulated to determine the parameters of the controller. Subsequently, a structural analysis for stability is proposed to clarify the DC responses in different operative conditions. Then, comparative simulations between DC and droop control are carried out using a detailed MG model, aiming to show the advantage of the proposed control strategy.",

This will help moving in the direction of a more sustainable energy scenario for buildings and energy systems also in the frame of novel configuration such as renewable energy communities.

      "abstract": "The integration of renewable energy sources (RESs) into electrical grids has experienced significant growth in recent decades, propelled by the pursuit of a sustainable energy future. However, as the share of renewable electricity production rises, the likelihood of overloading network components and having overvoltages also increases. Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs) offer a promising solution for mitigating RESs curtailment. Therefore, this paper proposes an energy storage sizing strategy aimed at minimizing RESs curtailment in a distribution system with renewable energy communities (RECs). This approach, which leverages linear voltage drop relations, distinguishes itself for its simplicity. The constraints of the optimization problem are defined to prevent overload of the primary substation transformer, issues of undervoltage and overvoltage at network nodes, and overcurrent problems in the feeders. Simulation results on a test distribution network validate the proposed method, providing a practical approach to sizing BESSs in RECs and maximizing renewable energy utilization.",

Six years of data are retrieved from the 81 kW PV power plant in the Savona campus of the University of Genoa and are used to train and test the algorithms. The performances of all the algorithms are compared over the original dataset, composed of meteorological variables linked with the PV production, a dataset using seasonal and trend decomposition (STL) of the meteorological variables, and some reduced datasets that mimic the situation in which some of the features are not available at least for some time steps. By comparing the results through different case studies, it can be justified that the XGB outperforms the other algorithms and the STL decomposition is helpful in increasing the performance of the model.",

      "abstract": "The needs to actuate a sustainable energy transition is pushing the electricity system and its operators to define new strategies and solutions to make the energy system more flexible and resilient, and to include a bigger share of renewable energy sources. This paper proposes a novel flexibilization service for the distribution system exploiting the capabilities of Renewable Energy Communities through the concept of Virtual Islanding operation. This new paradigm can ease the sustainable energy transition of distribution system, making them keener to accommodate larger shares of renewable sources in the grid. The concept of Virtual Islanding is described in the paper and a methodology to assess its benefits in electricity distribution networks is proposed. The effectiveness of Renewable Energy Communities Virtual Islanding operation is assessed in a simplified distribution system layout with massive penetration of RES, highlighting the benefits both from a technical and sustainability viewpoint.",

To this end, we discretize the current-field equations derived in the first part of this work and then formulate an inversion algorithm whose output is the attenuation function to be computed. Next, as a numerical application, this algorithm is tested under different conditions, i.e., by considering a variety of time windows and underlying models for the attenuation function. As a result, the possibility of obtaining satisfactory reconstructions, even for short-duration time-windows, is highlighted.",

      "abstract": "In a recent paper, a procedure to reconstruct the attenuation function of a return-stroke current from the simultaneous measurements of the channel-base current and the radiated electromagnetic fields was presented. One of the assumptions of the whole framework was that the sensors can record the overall time-evolution of the lightning return-stroke, namely from its start to its end. However, this condition is too restrictive for most of the real data collected in the past decades, since they were generally acquired for other goals than the reconstruction of the attenuation function. Accordingly, in the present paper we perform a theoretical investigation aimed at removing such restriction. As a result, we first derive a new set of integral equations that relate the channel-base current to the radiated fields during a generic time-window, then we obtain the corresponding equations in the frequency domain via Fourier Transform, which represent the analytical formulation of an inverse problem to be numerically solved through appropriate regularization techniques.",

      "abstract": "Lightning represents one of the most critical issues for electrical infrastructure. In dealing with overhead distribution line systems, indirect lightning strikes can lead to induced voltages overcoming the critical flashover value of the line, thus damaging the insulators. The computation of lightning-induced voltages requires the modeling of the lightning current, the evaluation of the lightning electromagnetic fields and the solution of the field-to-line coupling equations. The numerical calculation of the lightning electromagnetic fields is time-consuming and is strongly dependent on the lightning channel modeling and soil properties. This article presents a review of the most widely adopted methods to calculate the lightning electromagnetic fields, starting from the classical formulation, which requires numerical integration, and highlighting the most effective approaches that have been developed to reduce computational effort. This is done first for the case of a perfectly conducting ground, then the available formulations to account for the ground finite conductivity are presented together with their possible implementations in both the frequency and time domains.",

      "abstract": "To face the complexity introduced by the ever-increasing participation of new energy sources, storage systems and controllable loads to electricity markets, Distributed Energy Systems must optimize the power exchange. Usually, Energy Management System (EMS) are used to manage Micro-Grids (MGs) operations, but computational timings may become prohibitive, due to high number of constraints and links between parameters and technical constraints. This paper describes the evolution of the Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) MATLAB Based Energy Management System (MB-EMS) developed at the University of Genoa, aimed at optimizing the operating costs of a MG or plant, considering technical constraints and limitations of electrical and thermal production units, energy storage systems, non-programmable loads and flexible loads. Costs related to maintenance interventions and CO<inf>2</inf>emissions costs are also included, as well as incentives related to the High-Efficiency Cogeneration systems. Specific test cases for a real MG are solved in a short computational time over a time horizon of one year. Calculations are rapidly performed, also when dealing with 15 minutes resolution problems. In this sense, the developed tool can be used both as a real time scheduler, as instance for participation in the energy market sector, and in long term planning problems.",

It is commonly known that lightning current attenuates while propagating along the channel and several models have been adopted in an attempt to reproduce the characteristics of the electromagnetic fields at different distances. This work proposes a method that can reconstruct the attenuation of the current along the channel, starting from the knowledge of the channel-base current and of the vertical electric field measured by a sensor located five km away from the discharge location. The method relies upon the Tikhonov regularization technique applied to an ill-posed problem in the frequency domain and is mainly based on the hypothesis of long-time measurement windows.",

      "abstract": "The electromagnetic lightning field is usually computed by considering a model consisting in a vertical and rectilinear channel, as well as a Transmission-Line (TL) type propagation characterized by an attenuation function, which expresses how the current decreases while it travels upward along the lightning channel. When dealing with realistic channels, affected by tortuosity, the current attenuation is usually neglected and the field computation is cumbersome, since the discretization of the channel in a large number of linear segments has to be performed. This contribution presents an equivalent attenuation function to be used in the computation of vertical channels in order to reproduce the results of a tortuous one. The attenuation function is computed by solving an inverse problem through the Tikhonov regularization technique, and it is found to be reliable for distances larger than 5 km from the lightning channel.",

Moreover, a centralized secondary control is not required as the developed local controllers are able to nullify both frequency and voltage errors. Finally, the physical constraints related to BESS power and State Of Charge (SOC) limits are accounted and some theoretical hints are provided to justify why the frequency can be used as a triggering signal for the controllers to switch among the different operation modes even in absence of synchronous machines directly connected to the grid.",

      "abstract": "Among the effects of the climate change we are experiencing, the increase in the frequency of extreme event occurrences is evident. In this context, numerous studies confirmed the link between extreme meteorological events and the lightning activity. The possibility of having short-term predictions of the intensity of lightning phenomena would allow the near-real time monitoring of the evolution of such events. This paper proposes a multidisciplinary approach aiming at developing a regression algorithm to nowcast the density of cloud-to-ground lightning strokes one hour in advance. The proposed algorithm is developed thanks to the possibility to operate jointly with remote sensing imagery, numerical weather prediction model outcomes, and historical information on lightning. The possible dependence between meteorological data and lightning is seeked using Gaussian process regression models. The results obtained suggest that the proposed model can estimate low numbers of strokes accurately, whereas larger numbers of strokes are underestimated. Nevertheless, their presence is correctly detected. This suggests the potential of the proposed method as a processing tool to support the management of weather-related hazards.",

One of the most important variables is the channel-base current (CBC) waveform, usually measured by means of proper instruments installed on tall towers where the striking probability is higher. However, the presence of the tower itself and the low number of registered events represent a critical issue in the possibility of acquiring a large amount of data. On the other hand, Lightning Location Systems are able to provide a high number of data, but limited to the peak value of the current.

      "abstract": "Lightning may be the cause of outages and faults on electrical infrastructures. In overhead distribution lines, voltages overcoming the critical flashover value of the line may be induced by indirect lightning strikes, and this fact may cause serious damages to insulators. Consequently, the assessment of induced voltages is an important aspect in the design phase of transmission and distribution lines. To this goal, the lightning current shall be modeled, the electromagnetic fields should be evaluated and the field-to-line coupling equations implemented. In case time dependent functions are considered, the lightning electromagnetic fields may also be numerically approximated, but, usually, such approximation requires significant computational efforts and strongly depend on the way in which the lightning channel is modeled and on the soil properties. The present paper proposes an overview of the most utilized methodologies aiming at numerically or analytically approximating the lightning electromagnetic fields. Under the hypothesis of perfectly conducting ground, the classical formulation, requiring numerical integration is firstly presented. Then, the most effective approaches aiming at reducing computational timings are discussed. Finally, the models available to represent the lightning tortuosity are presented.",

      "abstract": "The present work focuses its attention on a no-inertia Microgrid (MG) with the combined presence of a Grid Forming (GFo) and a Grid Feeding (GFe) inverter. During Normal Operation (NO), the GFe inverter injects a specified amount of active and reactive power, while the GFo one acts as a slack bus. This way, the active and reactive power balance of the MG is respected until physical limits of the energy source are reached. At that time, the GFe inverter has to curtail its power. The paper aims to analytically show that the frequency measured by a Phase Locked Loop (PLL) connected at the GFe inverter busbar increases when this happens. This can be used as a signal for its control system to activate the power curtailment without the necessity of communication between the inverter controllers. This way, it is possible to mimic what happens in traditional networks, even if there are no rotating units directly connected to the network itself. Comparison with a detailed simulation is performed to assess the impact of the assumptions made to develop the analytical model and, thus, to show its effectiveness.",

      "abstract": "The ever-increasing participation of new energy sources, storage systems and controllable loads to electricity markets has introduced more complexity in the operation of power plants, microgrids (MGs) and networks. To face these issues, it is often necessary to design Distributed Energy Systems to optimize the power exchange. Usually, MG operation is managed by an Energy Management System (EMS) dealing with large amounts of parameters to be taken into account and that may drive to problems difficult to be faced and requiring long computational timings. In this direction, this paper describes the Mixed Integer Linear Programming MATLAB Based Energy Management System (MB-EMS) developed at the University of Genoa, aimed at optimizing the operating costs of a generic polygeneration system, considering different electrical and thermal production units, energy storage systems, non-programmable loads and flexible loads. Many important technical details are accounted: the duration and costs related to maintenance interventions and CO<inf>2</inf> emissions costs are considered for all production units as well as constraints and incentives related to the High-Efficiency Cogeneration systems. Constraints related to the minimum and maximum State-Of-Charge of energy storage systems, plus their deterioration, with the consequent optimization of their utilization, are also modelled. Specific test cases for all functionalities are presented. Moreover, a test related to a real MG performed over a time horizon of one year with a time step of 1 h is performed and solved in a short computational time. The linearization of constraints reduces the computational effort, avoiding the need of clustering or averaging parameters for similar production units. Consequently, calculations are rapidly performed, also when dealing with long term planning problems (a realistic test case with time horizon of one year and time step of 15 min can be simulated in some seconds). In this sense, the developed tool can be used both in real time operation and in long term planning problems.",

      "abstract": "A correct representation of the lightning current is crucial when the electromagnetic field radiated to a point of interest has to be computed. Based on the engineering models of Transmission Line type, such representation involves the knowledge of the return-stroke speed, the channel-base current, the channel height and the attenuation function. Whereas the first three quantities can be measured in different ways, no measurement technique can directly provide reliable information on the attenuation function. In the past decades, researchers have applied various strategies to address this problem. These strategies are all based on a common feature, i.e., the unknown function is postulated a priori and then validated through the comparison of the computed electromagnetic fields at one or more observation points with the corresponding measured waveforms. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach for the identification of the attenuation function: starting from appropriate measurements of the return-stroke speed, the channel-base current, the channel height and the radiated electromagnetic field, we first formulate an algebraic inverse and ill-posed problem, obtained from the discretization of integral equations relating the source to the radiated field in the frequency domain, and then we solve it by means of a Tikhonov regularization technique. The proposed framework is preceded by a detailed theoretical analysis, with special emphasis on the description and filtering of measurement noise and on the minimum duration of the measurement time-windows ensuring reliable results.",

The procedure considers downward negative first, negative subsequent, and positive return strokes, taking into account the number of strokes per flash (flash multiplicity) and the distance among return stroke impact points within the same flash (stroke terminations distance). The analysis of the effect produced using LLS data on the estimated number of flashovers per year on the test line is achieved by replacing one by one the standard distributions and parameters typically adopted in the literature, with those inferred from the LLS, when they can be considered reliable. Results show that adopting LLS-inferred parameters and distributions produces significant (positive or negative) variations in the estimated number of flashovers with respect to values computed with the standard approach.",

      "abstract": "Lightning electromagnetic (EM) fields are typically computed by assuming the current propagation within a straight vertical channel of negligible cross section. However, it is well known that the lightning path is tortuous and this can significantly affect the radiated fields and the lightning-induced voltages on power lines. Lupò et al. (2000) proposed an analytical method evaluating the EM fields radiated by a tortuous channel assuming a step current source; to consider an arbitrary (realistic) current source, a slow-converging convolution integral was applied. The aim of this article is to reduce the computation time of such procedure by extending to the tortuous channel case the approach proposed by Brignone et al. (2021) for the evaluation of the lightning EM fields with arbitrary current source, originally developed for a straight vertical channel. The performances of the present method are evaluated by means of comparison with the solution proposed by Lupò et al. (2000), showing an excellent agreement with a significant reduction of the CPU effort. This in principle will allow the computation of lightning-induced overvoltages at both individual and statistical level without a prohibitive computational effort.",

      "abstract": "Wind turbines (WTs) can beseriously damaged by lightning strikes and they can be struck by a significant number of flashes. This should be taken into account when the WT lightning protection system is designed. Moreover, WTs represent a path for the lightning current that can modify the well-known effects of the lightning discharge in terms of radiated electromagnetic fields, which are a source of damage and interference for nearby structures and systems. In this paper, a WT struck by a lightning discharge is analyzed with a full-wave modelling approach, taking into account the details of the WT and its interactions with the lightning channel. The effects of first and subsequent return strokes are analyzed as well as that of the rotation angle of the struck blade. Results show that the lightning current along the WT is mainly affected by the ground reflection and by the reflection between the struck blade and the channel. The computed electromagnetic fields show that, for subsequent return strokes, the presence of a WT almost doubles their magnitude with respect to a lightning striking the ground. Such enhancement is emphasized when the inclined struck blade is considered.",

      "abstract": "Sustainable energy transition, air pollution reduction and climate change mitigation are the most challenging themes in nowadays energy sector. Microgrids (MGs) are one of the most effective ways to integrate Renewable Energy Sources (RES), and among them PhotoVoltaic (PV)-Storage (ST) configuration is relevantly promising. Focusing the attention on the PV and ST converters primary control, the main needs are to properly regulate voltage and frequency and optimally exploit the energy coming from the sun and manage the ST operation without any communication among the converter controllers. The conventional converter control approach presents several drawbacks and thus a strategy based on Higher Order Sliding Mode (HOSM) is presented in this work. The HOSM converter control strategy is fully analysed defining its control laws and the control schemes. A comparison between the HOSM and conventional control is performed with dedicated simulations on a common benchmark MG in order to highlight the advantages of the proposed strategy.",

      "abstract": "Lightning strikes can seriously affect the reliability and availability of electrical infrastructures. The computation of lightning-electromagnetic fields represents one of the most crucial steps in the evaluation of the induced effects; thus, having at disposal accurate and efficient dedicated tools is essential. This paper proposes a new approach for the lightning-electromagnetic fields computation above a perfectly conducting ground. The proposed approach does not involve any assumption either on the channel-base current waveshape or on the attenuation function of the current along the channel. Integrals are expanded in series of exponential functions (Prony series) which makes them analytically solvable. The proposed approach results in a speed up of the computational time by a factor of 10 to some hundreds with respect to classical numerical approaches. The proposed method is validated against the classical formulas obtained through numerical integration for different channel-base current waveforms, attenuation functions and observation points.",

      "abstract": "Overhead distribution systems can be strongly affected and damaged by indirect lightning. The induced voltages are usually computed neglecting the surrounding geometry and the presence of buildings in urban areas. Buildings can strongly change the behavior of the measured lighting-induced electromagnetic (EM) fields in the proximity of the point of impact. As a consequence, induced voltages can deviate from what would be measured in the absence of buildings. This work proposes an analysis of the main variables, which affect the deviation of the EM fields and of the consequent induced voltages along an overhead distribution line due to the presence of a building. Different distances between the line and the building and different building heights are considered.",

      "abstract": "The relation between the increase in the frequency and the effects of extreme events with climate change has been widely demonstrated and the related consequences are a global concern. In this framework, the strong correlation between significant lightning occurrence and intense precipitation events has been also documented. Consequently, the possibility of having a short-term forecasting tool of the lightning activity may help in identifying and monitoring the evolution of severe weather events on very short time ranges. The present paper proposes an application of Random Forest (RF), a popular Machine Learning (ML) algorithm, to perform a nowcasting of Cloud-to-Ground (CG) lightning occurrence over the Italian territory and the surrounding seas during the months of August, September, and October from 2017 to 2019. Results obtained with three different spatial resolutions have been compared, suggesting that, to enhance the skills of the model in identifying the presence or absence of strokes, all the data selected as input should be commonly gridded on the finest available spatial resolution. Moreover, the features’ importance analysis performed confirms that meteorological features describing the state of the atmosphere, especially at higher altitudes, have a stronger impact on the final result than topology data, such as Latitude or Digital Elevation Model (DEM).",

      "abstract": "The Fourier transform (FT) of the electric field (EF) radiated by a lightning return stroke is shown to include a distributional term at zero frequency, which prevents numerical algorithms, such as fast FT, from working properly. Inspired by the finite duration of any field measurement in real applications, we introduce a time-windowing strategy, whereby the integration time-interval of the FT becomes bounded. As a result, the distributional term is removed from the FT, whereas the functional part of the FT is modified throughout the whole range of frequencies, in such a way that a good performance of the numerical algorithms can be restored. The dependence of the modified spectra of the EFs on the length of the time window is also investigated and three numerical experiments with different channel-base currents are performed to validate the whole resulting framework.",

Active and reactive power regulation is a major issue due to the necessity of optimally exploiting the sources characteristics and controlling voltage and frequency. Focusing the attention on the reactive power control, the main needs are to regulate voltage at suitable values and ensure a proper reactive power sharing among the energy sources. The conventional control for reactive power presents relevant drawbacks and so an Advanced Droop Control strategy (ADC) is presented to approach primary voltage control and reactive power sharing amongGrid-Supporting inverters in islandedMGs.TheADCstrategy is presented defining its control law and the control scheme with a stability analysis. Then, an analytical procedure is developed to set the controller parameters. Following, a comparison between the ADC and droop control is performed with dedicated simulations on a common benchmark Microgrid in order to highlight the advantages of the proposed control strategy. Finally, a comparison with other advanced control techniques is proposed in order to showthatADCis able to guarantee improved performance in terms of the combined regulation of voltage and reactive power.",

In particular, energy islands without synchronous generation, for example photovoltaic storage, are of major interest if one aims at a sustainable transition of these systems. In this Microgrid structure Grid-Forming and Grid-Feeding inverters need to be properly managed in order to cope with the features usually provided by the main power grid, i.e. frequency and voltage regulation. This paper wants to provide an analytical demonstration that even in no-inertia islands, the system frequency is still a suitable signal to provide frequency regulation and thus to guarantee the power balance and primary frequency regulation without any need of additional communication among generating units.",

      "abstract": "Lightning-related phenomena are one of the most dangerous factors affecting the overhead distribution systems. Said that, protective measures to reduce lightning damages are an important issue to guarantee distribution line reliability. The most widely employed protective measures against lightning are: shield wires, surge arresters, and increasing the line insulation level, usually by increasing the length of insulator strings. Among the aforementioned techniques, one that deserves a special attention is installing lightning arresters, since it can be very effective and commonly used in reducing lightning overvoltage. In this way, this paper presents a comparative study of the induced overvoltage calculation along insulator strings due to indirect lightning strikes in the distribution lines with and without the installation of surger arresters and comparing results considering a simple and rigorous modeling of the pole-footing grounding system. Furthermore, a simplified representation of the model of the pole-footing grounding system, in which the surge arresters will be installed, commonly adopted may lead to an underestimation of the overvoltage. The results point that the surge arresters are able to isolate the propagation of the induced voltages in adjacent poles by positioning them at poles in alternate pattern. The maximum voltage difference found when considering the rigorous model instead of the simplified model of the pole-footing grounding system, for the cases studied, was around 6.42%.",

      "abstract": "In islanded Microgrids (MGs) with converter based energy production, one of the main problem dealing with the primary level regulation is the proper reactive power sharing among the Distributed Energy Resources(DERs.) and the simultaneous voltage regulation. In this field the most used approach is based on the conventional droop control, but it presents some relevant drawbacks and so an Advanced Boost Control strategy (ABC) is presented to approach primary voltage control and reactive power sharing among Grid-Supporting inverters in islanded MGs. The ABC strategy is presented defining its control law and the control scheme together with relevant stability. Then, an analytical procedure is developed to set the controller parameters. Following, a comparison between the ABC and droop control is performed with dedicated simulations on a common benchmark MG in order to highlight the advantages of the proposed control strategy.",

For the correct evaluation of lightning-induced overvoltages, the frequency dependence of the electrical parameters of the soil should be considered. Therefore, this paper proposes a simplified approach which selects a representative frequency according to the front time of the current waveform at the base of the lightning channel and takes advantage of an approximate formula for the lightning-induced overvoltage peak which is available in the literature. The most relevant strengths of the proposed method are the simplicity of implementation and the reduced process time, which is extremely lower than that required by more sophisticated numerical methods. These characteristics make the proposed approach a simple and practical tool. The results show overvoltage decreases above 35 percent for soils of low conductivity. Therefore, the frequency dependence of the electrical parameters of the soil plays an important role.",

Thus, this paper considers the frequency-dependent soil electrical parameters in a previously developed approximate formula for the peak value of lightning-induced overvoltage on overhead lines. This approach consists of using a specific frequency (based on the lightning front time) to estimate the ground conductivity. Since the proposal is easy to implement and fast to run in any computational environment, it is a practical engineering tool. According to the results, it is possible to note the importance of applying models that take into account the variation of soil parameters with frequency, since overvoltage reductions for high resistivity soils above 35% were verified.",

      "abstract": "Dealing with lightning performance computation, researchers usually consider only negative downward first return strokes and the relevant channel-base peak current distribution. The aim of this article is to account for the lightning flash mechanism, which means to include also downward negative subsequent strokes and downward positive strokes, taking into account available distributions of the number of strokes per flash (i.e., the flash multiplicity) and of the distance among the impact points of the strokes within the same flash (i.e., the channel terminations distance). In this regard, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the present study is the first one taking into account the multiple ground channel terminations in the lightning performance assessment. The obtained results show that both the negative subsequent strokes and multiple channel termination determine a significant increase in the estimated number of flashovers per year, and they need to be considered in the lightning performance assessment. On the other hand, considering positive downward strokes, a less remarkable increase in the estimated number of flashovers per year is observed.",

The coefficients of such formulas are obtained thanks to a limited number of lightning field-to-line coupling simulations, thus guaranteeing a significant computational time saving with respect to already existing methods. The method is presented first with a preliminary analysis to get some insight into the functional relationship between each of such variables and the overvoltage. Then, the method is presented and validated against numerical calculations performed with a dedicated code, both in terms of punctual evaluations and overvoltage distribution.",

      "abstract": "Lightning is one of the most dangerous natural phenomena, able to produce high impacts and damage on human beings and infrastructures (civil, electric, telecommunications, etc.) even though perception of it as a hazard is low. The aim of this study is to provide a detailed analysis of lightning occurrence throughout the Italian territory to support the work of different operators and researchers (physicists, meteorologists and electric/ITC engineers) improving knowledge about the main properties of lightning. Thus, an in-depth study of the statistics of lightning activity across the Italian territory for the period 2010–2019 is performed in detail using the data collected by the Italian Lightning Detection Network SIRF (Sistema Italiano Rilevamento Fulmini), part of the European network EUCLID (European Cooperation for Lightning Detection). This analysis presents general properties such as Ground Stroke Density (GSD) and the positive to negative strokes ratio by highlighting how seasonal, geographical and orographic factors influence their values. Then, attention is focused on lightning peak current, on flash multiplicity and on the distance between the points of impact of different strokes within a flash. Comparison made with other articles available in the literature reveals good agreement with studies conducted with other LLS data in Mediterranean regions. On the other hand, some differences appear with direct current measurements that can be partly ascribed to Lightning Location System (LLS) detection contamination (confirming other comparative studies of LLS and instrumented tower findings), to differences between tower and ground measures, and to the presence of regional differences.",

      "abstract": "The paper presents a review of the approaches developed to solve the problem of primary voltage control and reactive power sharing (Q/V primary control) among converter interfaced production units present in a microgrid. First of all, a general survey of the methods is proposed with specific focus on communication-less methods that are surely the most challenging. Then, the article focuses on a detailed comparison of state-of-the-art communication-less approaches such as droop control (the most widely adopted) and three more recent alternative methods. A comparative analysis is performed by means of dedicated simulations on a common benchmark network in different operational and topological set-ups to highlight their advantages and drawbacks. The main result of this comparison is that the new methods are all improvements to the traditional droop technique, but network configuration and parameters have a great impact on the method performances and so a univocal ranking among them is not possible. Therefore, the issue of designing an effective Q/V primary controller for microgrids is still a partly open issue which requires further investigation and research.",

In this work, attention is focused on the effects of wideband modeling of electric grounding in the overvoltage calculation along insulator strings due to indirect lightning strikes. This study is done directly in the time-domain with the grounding being represented with an equivalent circuit accounting for its dynamics. Results show that the adoption of commonly adopted simplified grounding models, such as low-frequency resistance, may lead to an underestimation of the overvoltage. According to the results, differences in the order of 25% can be found in some studied cases.",

The developed approach aims at achieving a suitable management of the different operational assets of the PV-Storage islanded MGs providing seamless transitions among them and guaranteeing a continuous and effective power supply to the loads. Local inverter controllers are designed exploiting the capabilities of the Model Predictive Control; the resulting control architecture is a composition of local Distributed Generating (DG) unit controller relies only on measurements available on the DG unit site that allows nullifying both frequency and voltage errors providing a suitable repartition of the power request. This way, the proposed approach can combine the advantages of the classic droop and master/slave controllers as it needs neither communication among devices nor a secondary centralized control loop. Moreover, it is able to account for the Storage characteristics imposing a power curtailment of the PV units whenever either the power absorption or the State of Charge limit is reached.",

In this second case, a time-domain analytical expression for the Cooray-Rubinstein formula is presented. The main idea that leads to the derivation of analytical formulas consists of dividing the channel into intervals in which the distance between the field source point and the observation point can be approximated with a linear function of the time, and of the spatial coordinates of both points. In the companion aticle, a detailed comparison is proposed with the classical (numerical) approach highlighting an excellent agreement both at close and far distances, considering all the values of practical interest for the ground conductivity.

The validation is presented with different configurations in terms of channel-base current, ground conductivity, and distance to the lightning channel, comparing the obtained results with the numerical integration of the classical formulas. The comparative analysis shows a perfect agreement between the proposed analytical approach and reference numerical simulations. Moreover, the computational effort of the proposed method is discussed, focusing the attention on the choice of the points in which the channel has to be divided in order to maximize the CPU time savings without losing accuracy.",

When we deal with distribution lines, the lightning performance, which involves both direct and indirect events, usually neglects the well-known corona discharge that can occur on the conductors. This aspect can be usually accepted, but, as will be discussed in this paper, it cannot be omitted when we deal with overhead distribution lines with high Critical Flash-over value (CFO) and small diameters.

As well known, the stability of the FDTD scheme is determined by the Courant stability condition. In this contribution, it is shown that a second stability condition that limits the ratio between the space step and the line length appears when spatial extrapolation is used to obtain the values of the currents at the line extremities to be interfaced with a transient electromagnetic simulator. Finally, this work aims at solving the aforementioned problem by using a different approach to obtain the currents at the line extremities.",

An application to the Italian territory and the surrounding seas is then presented. Specifically, a dataset including eighteen geo-environmental features has been used to forecast 1-hour ahead lightning occurrence over a three-months period (August- October 2018). The features' importance resulting from the best RF model showed how data-driven models are able to identify relationships between variables, in agreement with previous physically-based knowledge of the phenomenon. The encouraging results obtained in terms of forecasting accuracy suggest how, after proper improvements, ML-based algorithms could find their place in wider early-warning systems to support disaster risk management procedures.",

      "abstract": "Microgrids (MGs) control is one of the most important and challenging topics in nowadays power system engineering research. The most common and well-known primary control logic is the droop one, since it allows MG sources to share the power request and to participate to the frequency and voltage regulation without a dedicated communication network. Therefore, the stability of a droop-controlled MG working point is a crucial issue that is typically assessed resorting to the small-signal stability theory. However, such approach does not allow to understand whether an equilibrium point can be reached starting from a specified initial condition. In this paper, this problem is faced proposing a stability condition that relies on some simplifying assumptions. The proposed solution does not need any numerical methods or software simulators (often highly CPU demanding). The developed methodology is validated with simulations performed in the PSCAD-EMTDC environment representing the MG components with a high level of detail.",

This contribution is focused on LLSs for intra-cloud and cloud-to-ground discharges, aiming at presenting an overview on the working principles of the most used techniques to locate lightning. The companion paper will describe in detail the performances of the main LLS and present examples of some existing LLS networks, with particular attention to the ones that operate in the Mediterranean areas.",

      "abstract": "This paper examines Singapore Pulau Ubin microgrid to determine a daily operation management system. Since the grid is an islanded one it lacks the connection to the national network, which would ensure ancillary services such as voltage support or power factor correction. The developed tertiary control system offers a coordinated active-reactive power optimization model for the Pulau Ubin distribution network equipped with an energy storage system, a solar panel field and three biodiesel generators. The aim is to minimize the operation costs and the voltage deviation of the distribution network, managing simultaneously both the active and reactive resources. The results have been validated through a simulation of daily operation carried out by the hour. Upon the successful implementation, this system can serve as a model for the future microgrid embedded in the new SIT campus in Punggol neighbourhood.",

      "abstract": "The primary regulation of photovoltaic (PV) systems is a current matter of research in the scientific community. In Grid-Feeding operating mode, the regulation aims to track the maximum power point in order to fully exploit the renewable energy sources and produce the amount of reactive power ordered by a hierarchically superior control level or by the local Distribution System Operator (DSO). Actually, this task is performed by Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)-based regulators, which are, however, affected by major drawbacks. This paper proposes a novel control architecture involving advanced control theories, like Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Sliding Mode (SM), in order to improve the overall system performance. A comparison with the conventional PID-based approach is presented and the control theories that display a better performance are highlighted.",

      "abstract": "Microgrids (MGs) interest is growing very fast due to the environment urgency and their capability to integrate renewable energy in a flexible way. In particular, islanded MGs in which distributed energy resources (DERs) are connected to the infrastructure with power electronic converters have attracted the interest of many researchers of both academia and industry because management, control and protection of such systems is quite different from the case of traditional networks. According to their operation mode, MGs that power electronic converters can be divided into grid-forming, grid-feeding and grid-supporting inverters. In particular, grid forming inverters are asked to impose voltage and frequency in the MG. This paper aims to propose a model predictive control (MPC) based approach for grid-forming inverters in an islanded MG. The MPC strategy is implemented because of its capability to define the optimal control actions that contemporarily track the desired reference signals and accounts for equality and inequality constraints. The overall problem formulation (objective function and relevant constraints) is described step by step and considers the specificity of the considered DC source. The proposed approach allows for the obtaining of very good results in terms of readiness against disturbances, even if it requires being fed only by local measurements. In order to validate the developed method, this paper proposes an experimental validation of the designed MPC controller in order to show its correct operation on a real system in a power hardware in the loop set-up using a rapid control prototyping approach.",

On one hand, numerical stability conditions of the finite-difference time-domain schemes have been deeply investigated in the presence of boundary conditions known analytically; on the other hand, there is not so much literature on the situations in which such conditions are provided in a numerical way through an external electromagnetic simulator. The study reveals that the commonly used linear extrapolation of currents at the line extremities might rise to numerical instabilities.

The simulation results show that the proposed BESS (Battery Energy Storage System) primary control is able to regulate frequency and voltage in Grid-Forming mode independently of the number of paralleled generators. This is achieved adopting a virtual generator technique which presents several advantages compared to the conventional one. Moreover, the proposed control can be switched to Grid-Support mode in order to provide fast control actions to allow frequency and voltage support as well as power control following the reference signals from the secondary level.",

The intrinsic differences between the Diesel Generator (DG) and a Voltage Source Inverter (VSI) interfacing the storage system with the microgrid distribution system imposes the definition of dedicated control and power management strategies in order to guarantee voltage and frequency regulation in islanded operation. For this reason, a dedicated control approach is defined in the present article and supported by some analytical considerations in order to demonstrate the frequency stability and the correct active power sharing among the sources. Finally, the proposed approach is validated by means of detailed simulations carried out using DIgSILENT PowerFactory ® in order to account for a detailed modelling of the system dynamics.

      "abstract": "One of the most important and studied topics in lightning research is the development of suitable models for the return stroke current and electromagnetic fields. In particular, when dealing with the so-called engineering models, the definition of a function that expresses the attenuation of the current while flowing in the discharge channel (from now on, the attenuation function) is of crucial importance for a reliable computation of the lightning discharge electromagnetic fields and the resulting over voltages induced in a power distribution electric system. The paper contributes to such topic in two ways: first of all, a review of all the well-known engineering models is presented, highlighting the definition of each attenuation function and comparing the models in terms of the resulting overvoltage induced on a typical distribution line. Secondly, an innovative idea based on the possibility of reconstructing the attenuation function starting from the measured electromagnetic fields is presented. The state of the art in this research line is outlined and the issues that are still open are presented. In particular the possibility of adopting the so-called regularization techniques to solve ill posed inverse problems to evaluate the current starting from electromagnetic fields is addressed analysing the available results and highlighting that, to the best of the authors knowledge, these techniques have never been applied with experimental data.",

The control strategy is based on model-predictive control (MPC), a model-based control that is widely adopted for the regulation of linear and nonlinear dynamical systems in various fields of application. The MPC is applied in a decentralized formulation, where only local measurements are necessary. The performances of the proposed control strategy are assessed by means of simulations on a Western Electricity Coordinating Council test case network and on the 39-Bus New England network. The results highlight both the good behavior of the MPC control technique, even in conditions that traditional emergency control would not support, and the robustness of the proposed structure against power system modeling approximations.",

      "abstract": "The new electric power generation scenario, characterized by growing variability due to the greater presence of renewable energy sources (RES), requires more restrictive dynamic requirements for conventional power generators. Among traditional power generators, gas turbines (GTs) can regulate the output electric power faster than any other type of plant; therefore, they are of considerable interest in this context. In particular, the dynamic performance of a GT, being a highly nonlinear and complex system, strongly depends on the applied control system. Proportional–integral–derivative (PID) controllers are the current standard for GT control. However, since such controllers have limitations for various reasons, a model predictive control (MPC) was designed in this study to enhance GT performance in terms of dynamic behavior and robustness to model uncertainties. A comparison with traditional PID-based controllers and alternative model-based control approaches (feedback linearization control) found in the literature demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

Each study of safety and security associated to lightning flashes needs as input reliable data in terms of lightning activity related to the analyzed territory. In this framework, the analysis presented in this work focuses on the lightning activity measured in the Italian territory for the period 2013-2014 thanks to the use of the Lightning Location System provided by the Meteorological Service of the Italian Air Force. The results show the differences between seasons, stroke polarity and stroke locations in terms of some parameters such as the Ground Flash Density and seasonal daytime distribution, as well as the channel-base current peak.",

For this reason, suitable expressions for the helix electromagnetic fields are presented and conditions under which they can be approximated with the ones produced by the classical lightning channel model (i.e., a vertical antenna) are derived. Moreover, the analysis of the deviations between measurements and calculations is used as a tool to propose a channel vertical coordinate dependent function for the speed that guarantees the best fitting. The validation is done considering different line configurations, from a single line to a complex layout with one main feeder and many laterals and in the presence of non-linear elements, such as surge arresters.",

      "abstract": "Gas turbines are raising nowadays growing interest in the power generation industry. Being able to regulate their power production faster than any other form of conventional source, they are extremely valuable in compensating stochastic power fluctuations deriving from renewable energy sources in large-scale electrical grids, preserving grid stability, etc. In this context, gas turbines' dynamic performance plays a key role and it needs to be enhanced (however preserving the machine lifetime at the same time). Nonlinear model based control systems can effectively deal with this problem, exploiting the system structure to obtain optimal dynamic performance. Therefore, this paper aims at developing a sliding mode model based control for gas turbines. The results obtained from its application on a heavy duty Ansaldo gas turbine model (AE94.3A4) are compared to the ones obtained to the traditional control employed in these applications.",

      "abstract": "Model-based control techniques have been gaining more and more interest these days. These complex control systems are mostly based on theories, such as feedback linearization, model predictive control, adaptive and robust control. In this paper the latter approach is investigated, in particular, sliding mode (SM) control is analyzed. While several works on the description and application of SM control on single-input single-output systems can easily be found, its application on multi-input multi-output systems is not examined in depth at the same level. Hence, this work aims at formalizing some theoretical complements about the necessary conditions for the feasibility of the SM control for multi-input-multi-output systems. Furthermore, in order to obtain the desired performance from the control system, a method for parameter tuning is proposed in the particular case in which the relative degree of the controlled channels is equal to one. Finally, a simple control problem example is shown with the aim of stressing the benefits derived from the application of the theoretical complements described here.",

      "abstract": "The increasing penetration of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) and, more in general, of converter connected power generation is progressively reducing the overall inertia of the electricity system introducing new challenges in the network Frequency Support (FS). Therefore, FS strategies for RES are becoming an important aspect to be developed in order to en-sure the secure operation of the electricity power grid. The aim of the present paper is to propose an innovative approach for the inertial emulation of Wind Turbine Generators (WTGs) in order to ensure a positive effect on the system frequency avoiding unstable operations of the WTG and reducing the negative impact of the rotor speed recovery on the secondary frequency drop. Moreover, the paper provides a detailed definition of the triggering logics adopted to activate and deactivate the FS making it suitable for implementation in available industrial controllers. The proposed controller is firstly tested on a simplified configuration to show its enhanced performances with respect to previously developed approaches. Then, simulations are carried out in a more realistic network to assess the positive impact of the controller on the system frequency. Results highlighted a 40% reduction of the system Rate of Change of Frequency while the frequency deviation at the transient nadir is improved by 35%.",

      "abstract": "Nuclear fusion represents in the current century one of the most important challenges in the energy field. Achieving such an important goal will completely change the energy scenario and it will reduce the current dependency on fossil fuels with a sustainable alternative. In this framework, ITER project represents the most advanced project for nuclear fusion all over the world. However, challenges related to the physics of the plasma and many others related to various fields of engineering need to be faced in order to accomplish the ITER project development. In particular, one is the need for the definition of suitable discharging units able to de-energise the superconductive coil power supply when necessary. This paper deals with the application of arc models available in the literature to support the definition of a suitable layout for the previously mentioned Fast Discharging Units. This can be achieved firstly by defining a procedure to identify the optimal parameters of the so-called 'Black Box Arc Models' in order to fit the experimental oscillograms provided by circuit breakers producers and secondly by implementing it on a circuital simulator in order to define the compliance of the discharging unit with the coil insulation limits.",

      "abstract": "Lightning overvoltages are one of the most dangerous factors affecting the power quality of a distribution grid. In medium voltage (MV) overhead distribution systems, lightning transients can be caused by either direct or indirect strikes. Indirect strikes are much more frequent than direct strikes and can cause flashovers, especially when the line insulation level is low. The most widely employed protection measures against lightning overvoltages are the use of the shield wires, and/or surge arresters, and increasing the line insulation level. In particular, many studies have shown a significant reduction in the induced voltage magnitudes, thanks to the use of the shield wires in both transmission and distribution systems. This paper deals with the possibility of adopting the shield wires to mitigate lightning induced overvoltages in MV networks, and proposes an analysis on the main parameters that influence their performances. This aim is pursued by means of a probabilistic and statistical analysis based on the response surface method (RSM), which permits to obtain the equation of the surface that best approximates a given model. The application and efficiency of the proposed RSM-based approach have been illustrated by applying it to a realistic situation of a rural distribution line.",

      "abstract": "The paper aims at presenting a methodology to choose the proper sizing of an integrated Photovoltaic unit and a storage architecture starting from the knowledge of the load and solar irradiance time profiles. To do this, first a simple logic to manage the charging/discharging of the storage is proposed, then the function representing the overall cost during the whole life of the system is derived. The computation of the cost function for different photovoltaic and storage sizes allows finding the best sizing of the system. Finally, a thorough economic analysis is conducted to provide criteria to check whether the investment is economically advantageous. This is done considering the impact of the economic variables which are more influential on the investment key assessment parameters. The proposed methodology has been validated in different realistic test cases against the results provided by an energy management system, showing an excellent agreement between the approaches. Moreover, the economic analysis has been applied to four realistic situations in order to tailor the microgrid components ratings on the specific test case.",

Two strategies have been developed in literature: the first one proposes some functions and validates them by means of comparisons between the electromagnetic fields calculated starting from the assigned model and the measured ones. Another possibility consists of measuring the electromagnetic field and reconstructing the channel current by solving an inverse problem, which can be done resorting to some dedicated mathematical tools: the so-called regularization techniques.",

      "abstract": "The number of fully-rated converter wind turbine generators equipped with a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) has sensibly increased in the late years. The optimal utilization and controllability of a PMSG is achieved using a Pulse Width Modulation – Voltage Source Converter (PWM-VSC) that allows interfacing the electric machine with the distribution network by means of a DC link. The generator/Machine-Side Converter (MSC) controls the operation of the PMSG. This paper proposes a methodology to assess the feasibility of the steady-state working points of PMSG based wind turbines without running a set of time-consuming time-domain simulations. Three control objectives for MSC are usually considered: stator voltage control, unitary power factor control and torque control. The aim of the present paper is that of providing an analytical methodology to check the feasibility of the steady-state working points dictated by different control strategies of the MSC starting from the specific operational constraints provided by the wind power plants characteristics. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated comparing numerical results of a MATLAB® implementation against dedicated time-domain simulations. Simulations results demonstrated the appropriate performance of the proposed methodology characterized by the almost negligible computational time required.",

The proposed methodology is used to assess the impact of the BESS equipped with sensible frequency controller on the frequency behaviour of the system after a system frequency disturbance considering the variability coming from power system uncertainties. The proposed meteorology is tested in an illustrative power system considering the integration of a grid-scale BESS equipped with inertial frequency response controller, the uncertainty of the power system is simulated by the variability of the power demand. Monte Carlo simulations and time-domain simulations, using DIgSILENT<sup>®</sup> PowerFactory™ are combined in the implementation of the proposed methodology.

The main objective of this control strategy is that of allowing a decoupled and dynamically performing control of active power (by the MPPT curve) and reactive power at the point of interconnection to the grid. Moreover, the control will be able to integrate frequency supporting logics, such as synthetic inertial control and active power curtailment. The control synthesis is fully detailed and validated by means of dedicated simulations in comparison with the traditional control scheme for this type of wind generators.",

      "abstract": "Microgrids (MGs) may represent a new answer to many old problems in energy and electric world, such as pollution, high reliability, efficiency and so on. The MG rapid increase implies a fast transformation of the electric power systems that are now characterized by new energy sources requiring dedicated control architectures and simulation tools. Unfortunately, the majority of such new sources are connected to the MG by means of power electronic converters that often make it impossible to replicate some of the concepts, tools and control philosophies commonly used in traditional networks. For this reason, there is a strong need of developing models for MG structures that can be reliable but sufficiently simple to be used for the control system design. In this framework, this paper presents a simplified first harmonic model for the Smart Polygeneration Microgrid (SPM) located in the Savona Campus of the University of Genoa that allows the interface with many controllers. The developed simplified model is validated comparing it with a complete simulation performed in the PSCAD-EMTDC environment that allows to represent each component with a high level of detail.",

      "abstract": "The present paper proposes an Energy Management System (EMS) to be used in grid connected microgrids. To do this, first a suitable model (for optimization purposes) of all the components that typically appear in a microgrid is presented, then, four possible electric network models are detailed and finally the overall architecture of the optimization problem of the EMS is set up. Moreover, as the optimization of the energy production/consumption of a microgrid relies on the thermal and electric load and on the renewables forecasting, an online empirical correction of forecasted data is proposed, highlighting its positive impact on the overall operational cost of the microgrid. Another aspect which is accounted regards the possibility of allowing the EMS to act as a power plant controller in compliance with the Distribution System Operator (DSO) requirements in terms of reactive power management and voltage control (as requested by the majority of grid codes and national regulations). So, the proposed algorithm structure splits the optimization problem into two sub problems: the first one basically dictates the active power production of the dispatchable units minimizing an economic objective function, while the second accounts for the satisfaction of the DSO requirements. The experimental validation of the proposed EMS is performed on the University of Genoa Smart Polygeneration Microgrid (SPM), where the proposed EMS is currently running. The considered test cases highlight the effectiveness of the proposed EMS in economically operating the microgrid (compared to simpler EMS previously installed in the SPM) and in satisfying the reactive power or voltage regulation requirements provided by the Italian technical requirements.",

As far as the first aspect is concerned, the procedure is cyclically repeated at each time-step after that loads and renewable productions have been adjusted by means of real-time measurements. The economic aspects are performed by solving an optimization problem that minimizes the overall production cost and, therefore, it fixes the active power set point for all the programmable units. The Distribution System Operator (DSO) requirements in terms of active/reactive power management and voltage control, as requested by the majority of grid codes/standards, are satisfied (if possible) by tuning the reactive power of the programmable units.

      "abstract": "The paper aims at defining a methodology to evaluate the lightning performance of a system of overhead distribution lines. As is well known, the evaluation of the lightning performance relies generally on a Monte Carlo approach that generates many different lightning events and calculates the corresponding overvoltages. To perform such calculation, the power system computer aided design (PSCAD) module developed in the companion paper is adopted. However, as any call to PSCAD implies a nonnegligible computational effort, here an efficient approach is presented in order to limit the number of simulations as much as possible. The obtained results are compared with the ones provided by other available techniques both on simple structures in order to highlight the main features of the method and on a typical Italian distribution network segment. The comparative analysis shows good agreement between the methods and the effectiveness of the proposed technique in terms of computational effort reduction.",

First, the theoretical formulation of the problem in the time domain is presented. Then its numerical solution together with its implementation is described. Finally, a PSCAD-EMTDC interface and platform is developed, which allows us to model a realistic network, automatically distinguish between direct and indirect strokes and account for power network precontingency conditions. The obtained results are compared with a frequency-domain solution for a simple case in order to validate the finite-difference time-domain method adopted to solve the coupling equations and the interface with PSCAD. The comparison with the well-known LIOV code for a more complex case is used as a general validation of the overall tool. In a companion paper, the developed platform will be used to evaluate the lightning performance of a portion of the Italian MV distribution network.",

      "abstract": "The achievement of the so-called 2020 targets requested by the European Union (EU) has determined a significant growth of proposals of solutions and of technical projects aiming at reducing the CO<inf>2</inf> emissions and increasing the energy efficiency, as well as the penetration of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) in the electric network. As many of them ask for funding from the EU itself, there is the necessity to define a methodology to rank them and decide which projects should be sponsored to obtain the maximum effect on the EU 2020 targets. The present paper aims at (i) defining a set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to compare different proposals, (ii) proposing an analytical methodology to evaluate the defined KPIs and (iii) evaluating the maximum impact that the considered action is capable of producing. The proposed methodology is applied to a set of possible interventions performed on a benchmark transmission network test case, in order to show that the defined indicators can be either calculated or measured and that they are useful to rank different \"smarting actions\".",

      "abstract": "This paper focuses on the modeling of wind turbines equipped with direct drive permanent magnet synchronous generators for fundamental frequency power system simulations. Specifically, a procedure accounting for the system active power losses to initialize the simulation starting from the load flow results is proposed. Moreover, some analytical assessments are detailed on typical control schemes for fully rated wind turbine generators, thereby highlighting how active power losses play a fundamental role in the effectiveness of the wind generator control algorithm. Finally, the paper proposes analytical criteria to design the structure and the parameters of the regulators of the wind generator control scheme. Simulations performed with Digsilent Power Factory validated the proposed procedure, highlighting the impact of active power losses on the characterization of the initial steady state and that the simplifying assumptions done in order to synthesize the controllers are consistent with the complete modeling performed by the aforementioned power system simulator.",

      "abstract": "The growing development of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) has seen the spread of architectures with transmission based on planetary gear train, realized thanks to two electric machines. This architecture, by continuously regulating the transmission ratio, allows the internal combustion engine (ICE) to work in optimal conditions. On the one hand, the average ICE efficiency is increased thanks to better loading situations, while, on the other hand, electrical losses are introduced due to the power circulation between the two electrical machines mentioned above. The aim of this study is then to accurately evaluate electrical losses and the average ICE efficiency in various operating conditions and over different road missions. The models used in this study are presented for both the Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) architecture and the Discontinuously Variable Transmission (DVT) architecture. In addition, efficiency maps of the main components are shown. Finally, the simulation results are presented to point out strengths and weaknesses of the CVT architecture.",

      "abstract": "Microgrids (MGs) represent surely the most challenging topic in electrical engineering, promising the decreasing of carbonization, the totally integration of different renewable sources and a cheap solution for those rural areas where electric distribution is economically unsustainable. The most important feature of a MG is represented by the possibility to work in islanded configuration in order to satisfy its own load without the support of the main grid. Literature is poor of experimental results on islanded MG and the research has focused on theoretical approaches on several topics, such as frequency, voltage stability, modeling, software simulations and energy management systems. The purpose of this article is to provide some experimental results such as power supply, voltage and frequency measurement during islanded operation. This test campaign was performed in the Smart Polygeneration Microgrid, a test tool of University of Genova created for experimental validation for grid-connected and islanded MG operation.",

      "abstract": "The increased integration of wind generation via high power converters imposses numerous gauntlet to the management and control of modern power systems. One of them is caused by the decoupling effect between the power sources from the AC grid. It negatively impacts the system frequency response of modern power systems. This paper proposes a controller to enable the primary frequency regulation on fully rated wind turbine generators. The proposed controller is designed to enable primary frequency response mimiquing the classical syncrhonous generator controles. It includes a droop control and an other to enable the inertia response. Simulations on a test system are used to examine the frequency response provided by the prioposed strategy. The most important contributions of this paper is to demonstrate there is an actual limit value of the synthetic inertia gain that can be used in the controllers and that it is dependent on the system frequency noise.",

      "abstract": "Microgrids (MGs) may represent a solution in the near future to many problems in the energy and electric world scenarios; such as pollution, high reliability, efficiency and so on. In particular, MGs' capability to work in an islanded configuration represents one of their most interesting features in terms of the improvement of the reliability of the system, the integration of renewable energy sources and the exploitation of the quick response and flexibility of power electronic devices in a stand-alone system. In order to study and validate innovative solutions and control strategies for islanded operation, there is a need to develop models for MG structures that can be reliable and sufficiently simple to be used for the purpose of the design and validation of innovative control systems. This paper proposes a simplified, first harmonic model for a generic structure of MG characterized by its use of only electronic power converter interfaced generation. The main advantages of the proposed method lie in the model's simplicity and its reduced solving time, thanks to the limited number of necessary parameters to describe the system. Moreover, the developed formulation allows the avoidance of specific (and often licensed) software to simulate the system. The performances of the proposed model have been validated by means of a comparative analysis of the results obtained against a more accurate representation of the system performed in the power system CAD-electromagnetic transient and DC (PSCAD-EMTDC) environment, which allows for the representation of each component with a very high level of detail. Such comparison has been performed using the University of Genoa Savona Campus Smart Polygeneration Microgrid testbed facility, due to the availability of all the necessary numerical values.",

      "abstract": "Severe weather events are responsible for hundreds of fatalities and millions of euros of damage every year on the Mediterranean basin. Lightning activity is a characteristic phenomenon of severe weather and often accompanies torrential rainfall, which, under certain conditions like terrain type, slope, drainage, and soil saturation, may turn into flash flood. Building on the existing relationship between significant lightning activity and deep convection and precipitation, the performance of the Lightning Potential Index, as a measure of the potential for charge generation and separation that leads to lightning occurrence in clouds, is here evaluated for the V-shape back-building Mesoscale Convective System which hit Genoa city (Italy) in 2014. An ensemble of Weather Research and Forecasting simulations at cloud-permitting grid spacing (1 km) with different microphysical parameterizations is performed and compared to the available observational radar and lightning data. The results allow gaining a deeper understanding of the role of lightning phenomena in the predictability of V-shape back-building Mesoscale Convective Systems often producing flash flood over western Mediterranean complex topography areas. Moreover, they support the relevance of accurate lightning forecasting for the predictive ability of these severe events.",

The dynamic performances of a gas generating units are limited by the combustion chamber dynamics where sudden temperature variation may lead to undesired and dangerous phenomena. The FBL application will allow introducing an ideal decupling of the regulated channels so that power variation will have a minimal impact on the combustion chamber temperature obtaining a smoother and quicker response to reference changes in comparison with a tradition, PID based control. The proposed FBL controller will be also tested in presence of model and parameters uncertainties in order to verify the robustness of the proposed control technique.",

      "abstract": "Severe weather events are responsible for hundreds of fatalities and millions of euros of damage every year in the Mediterranean basin. Lightning activity is a characteristic phenomenon of severe weather and often accompanies torrential rainfall, which under certain conditions like terrain type, slope, drainage and soil saturation can generate flash flood. Therefore, the improvement in forecast skill for those high impact weather events is one of the main challenges in early warning systems. On the line of this need the behavior of the Lightning Potential Index (LPI) is evaluated in different case studies involving complex terrain. Such index represents a measure of the potential for charge generation and separation that lead to total lightning occurrence in clouds (both IC and CG).",

      "abstract": "The estimation of the lightning performance of a power distribution network is of great importance to design its protection system against lightning. An accurate evaluation of the number of lightning events that can create dangerous overvoltages requires a huge computational effort, as it implies the adoption of a Monte Carlo procedure. Such a procedure consists of generating many different random lightning events and calculating the corresponding overvoltages. The paper proposes a methodology to deal with the problem in two computationally efficient ways: (i) finding out the minimum number of Monte Carlo runs that lead to reliable results; and (ii) setting up a procedure that bypasses the lightning field-to-line coupling problem for each Monte Carlo run. The proposed approach is shown to provide results consistent with existing approaches while exhibiting superior Central Processing Unit (CPU) time performances..",

This paper evaluates two inertial controller for full-rated power converter wind turbines, Type 4: (A) releasing hidden inertia controller and (B) fast power reserve emulation.

In particular, the overall system is optimized in order to schedule generation plants, storage systems, electrical vehicles, deferrable and variable loads with the minimum daily operating costs, taking also into account network constraints. Binary and auxiliary variables have been used to reduce the nonlinearity of the model. Moreover, a technique based on Model Predictive Control (MPC) is proposed to minimize uncertainties coming from renewable resources and to reduce the complexity of the overall decision problem solution. The proposed approach has been developed exploiting, as a reference and practical test-case, the Savona Campus of the Genoa University, where the research infrastructure Smart Polygeneration Microgrid (SPM) is in operation; day-ahead optimization results have been compared with those of the proposed MPC approach.",

      "abstract": "The present paper aims at defining a simplified but effective model of a thermal network that links the thermal power generation with the resulting temperature time profile in a heated or refrigerated environment. For this purpose, an equivalent electric circuit is proposed together with an experimental procedure to evaluate its input parameters. The paper also highlights the simplicity of implementation of the proposed model into a microgrid Energy Management System. This allows the optimal operation of the thermal network to be achieved on the basis of available data (desired temperature profile) instead of a less realistic basis (such as the desired thermal power profile). The validation of the proposed model is performed on the Savona Campus Smart Polygeneration Microgrid (SPM) with the following steps: (i) identification of the parameters involved in the equivalent circuit (performed by minimizing the difference between the temperature profile, as calculated with the proposed model, and the measured one in a set of training days); (ii) test of the model accuracy on a set of testing days (comparing the measured temperature profiles with the calculated ones); (iii) implementation of the model into an Energy Management System in order to optimize the thermal generation starting from a desired temperature hourly profile.",

The first step aims at performing an economical optimization, as it provides the active power set-point for the programmable units that minimizes the overall production cost. The second step is related to power quality issues (power factor correction or voltage support), as it produces in output the reactive power reference signal for all the devices under converter. Moreover, due to the presence of uncertainties in the electric and thermal load request and in the Renewable Energy Sources (RES) power production, an update forecasting logic is proposed that, applied at each time step of the optimization process, refines the forecast accuracy. The experimental validation performed on the SPM shows the efficacy of the proposed EMS in satisfying both the economic and the power quality objectives.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This paper proposes a methodology for the equivalent modeling of large photovoltaic power plants at the Point of Interconnection with the transmission/distribution network. The interest in such a methodology lays in the fact that recently Transmission/Distribution System Operators (TSOs/DSOs) have extended the requirements for the connection of renewable generation to their electricity networks beyond the only supply of active power, requiring ancillary services too. It is then a primary necessity for the Companies which operate in the market of large photovoltaic plants to have a simple but effective tool to verify the compliance of a proposed plant layout with specific TSO requirements (which vary from country to country) in order to support the bidding and preliminary design phase of the project. After an overview of the typical layout of large photovoltaic plants, the proposed methodology is fully described. In order to verify its reliability, the method is validated against exact load flow calculations on a test case photovoltaic plant layout. In the light of the good results achieved by the methodology validation, the last part of the paper proposes an application to infer the power plant capability and the compliance check with reference to specific TSOs requirements.",

Such a model is particularly useful when one has to represent the line into a more complex power system, modeled in a lumped way. To reach this goal, it is necessary to produce a reliable and computationally effective solution to the problem of the high-frequency electromagnetic field coupling with a terminated transmission line. From a mathematical standpoint, this problem can be presented by means of an integral equation whose solution can be achieved with regularization procedures for linear inverse problems. In order to obtain a computationally efficient result, the unknown current is first developed in a Fourier series and then the Landweber iterative algorithm is applied to identify the series coefficients. The proposed method is then tested taking as reference the numerical results obtained using the Numerical Electromagnetics Code (NEC-2), reaching a good agreement.",

This methodology can be then employed in the design phase of large photovoltaic plants in order to have a preliminary evaluation of the system efficiency and of the capability of reactive power exchange with the electricity system operators (TSOs and DSOs). This necessity is strictly related to the increasing number of TSOs and DSOs that require photovoltaic plants to provide ancillary services, such as the supply of reactive power and the participation in voltage regulation.",

      "abstract": "The evaluation of the indirect lightning performance of an overhead power line is typically represented by means of curves reporting how many lightning faults per year the line may experience as a function of its insulation level, and so it expresses the probability that the line is subject to an overvoltage greater than its critical flashover voltage (CFO). Obtaining this curve is a very time-consuming task from a computational point of view, since the evaluation of the lightning overvoltage requires the solution of the field-to-line coupling problem and this has to be repeated a significant number of times, taking into account the possible values assumed by all the stochastic variables that influence the process. In this contribution, some mathematical properties of the probability density functions (PDF) are exploited in order to derive a formula in which the probability that an overvoltage caused by an indirect lightning event is greater than an assigned value can be computed simply by a numerical evaluation of an integral. The results have been compared with those obtained applying a classical Monte Carlo technique, showing an excellent agreement between the two approaches with a considerable CPU time reduction.",

Finally, the application of MPC strategy to a WECC (Western Electricity Coordinating Council) test case network shows that the effects of a contingency, that would bring the system to instability without any external action, are mitigated by the control action, leading the network to a new working point, as close as possible to the previous one and, most of all, without exceeding the stability limits.",

Such microgrid is designed to produce electric and thermal energy by means of renewable generation units, cogenerative gas turbines, a storage unit and electric vehicle charging stations. The work focuses its attention on the issue of the microgrid day-ahead power production optimization. Such problem consists in finding the power production profiles for all the dispatchable units in order to optimize a well-defined goal (economical, environmental, etc). This requires to model all the components of the grid in order to define the set of constraints for the optimization procedure. In particular, the way of representing the electric power balance equations plays a crucial role since a trade-off between accuracy and computational efforts is required. Different approaches are presented and tested on the SPM, e.g. complete load flow, modified DC load flow and single bus-bar representation, in order to highlight the peculiarity of the different optimization models obtained and evaluate their impact on computational time, result accuracy and possibility of future experimental validation.",

      "abstract": "The strong increase in the number of installed photovoltaic (PV) production plants has slowly changed the assets and the operating conditions of the electricity power system. In this context, the supply and control of the reactive power from the renewable generation plants are becoming an important issue to be exploited that can facilitate the integration of PV and wind power in electricity grids. The aim of this paper is to propose an optimized control strategy to manage the reactive power resource generated by PV plants in order to improve the quality of the low/medium voltage distribution network and meet the latest technical requirements listed by distribution system operators in their grid codes. A methodology to define the optimal reactive power references for each PV unit connected to a generic distribution network is presented for a specified goal (e.g., the achievement of suitable voltage levels at the grid nodes). Such reference signals are then provided to the PV plants regulation systems, which are designed in order to guarantee the decoupling between the active and reactive power channels, due to the use of the Feedback Linearization control technique. The problem is formulated in a generalized way, so that it can be extended to any possible grid configuration. © 2013 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The increased penetration of renewable energy sources and the concept of a dynamic and highly distributed Smart Grid which can intelligently integrate production units, storage systems and connected users opened new challenges in the application of optimization techniques. In this work, a dynamic optimization problem is formulated on a power grid characterized by wind and photovoltaic production units, conventional power plants, biomass co-generation and storage systems. A Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme is adopted in the dynamic decision model for real time purposes. The decision problem takes into account the network load flows constraints and a state equation related to the state of charge (SOC) of the batteries. Different issues (economic, technical, environmental, security) have been taken into account for the formalization of the objective function. Numerical results are finally reported and discussed. © 2012 IEEE.",

The aim of the present work is to introduce an innovative optimized control strategy to exploit the reactive power resource generated by photovoltaic plants in order to improve the quality and efficiency of the low/medium voltage distribution network. Here, a methodology to define the optimal reactive power reference for every photovoltaic unit of the network is presented in order to pursue a well-defined goal, such as the minimization of the Joule losses or the voltage support. Such reference signals are then provided to the photovoltaic control systems that will guarantee the decoupling between the reactive power channel and the active power one, thanks to the use of the FeedBack Linearization (FBL) control technique.

The algorithm, implemented in the frequency domain, consists of solving the integro-differential equation that relates the incident electric field with the current induced into the line. The unknown current is expressed by means of a Fourier series whose coefficients are calculated applying the Landweber method. The use of such method makes it possible to face both measurement and parametric uncertainties, since it has been developed and is widely used to solve inverse problems that are typically ill-posed.

      "abstract": "This article proposes an advanced non-linear control algorithm to manage active power and voltage provided by a synchronous generator. The algorithm is based on the so-called feedback linearization theory, which relies on the central concept to algebraically transform non-linear systems dynamics into fully or partly linear ones, so that linear control techniques can be applied. Starting from the basic (electrical, magnetic, and mechanical) machine equations, a suitable state transformation is introduced in order to apply the feedback linearization block to the generator model. A regulation scheme is then derived, which receives as inputs the measure and reference signals of both the electric power and the voltage at the generator side and produces as outputs the physical inputs of the machine, i.e., the mechanical torque and the field voltage. Particular attention is devoted to both the linearization process, where internal dynamics and stability studies play an important role, and to the design of the two (power and voltage) decoupled regulators. Several simulations are finally performed in order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach and to highlight its main advantages and drawbacks with respect to the traditional P-V synchronous generator control strategy. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a model for the analysis of internal faults of synchronous generators with multiple parallel connection paths for phase. Several kinds of faults between different portions of the stator windings (and ground, if the case) can be described in the subtransient time frame. Data necessary for the model derive from the electromagnetic design of the machine, as well as from details on equivalent parameters of the external grid and from the neutral connection characteristics. Such modeling procedure allows accurate insight of currents in windings and terminals, exploring each possible fault configuration. In the second part of this work, the developed model will be applied to assess the validity and to define possible improvements of conventional protection configurations against internal faults.

      "abstract": "In this paper, a new representation for the lightning channel base current is proposed in terms of the so-called Prony series, obtained by means of a modified time-domain variant of the well-known vector fitting technique. This method allows both to reproduce in an equivalent way previous analytical representations such as Heidlers function and, more interestingly, to obtain a smooth analytical interpolation of measured raw data, in an automatic though tunable way, without the need of filtering, and taking into account the desired behavior of the current for t 0. Furthermore, a Prony series, i.e., a representation in terms of a sum of exponentials and/or dumped sinusoids, permits us to carry out the computation of the integrals expressing the lightning electromagnetic fields by means of a recursive convolution algorithm, thus reducing the required CPU time. This makes the proposed approach extremely useful for studies of lightning performance of distribution lines, which require the simulation of an appreciable number of cases. © 2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "This paper focuses on the development of a control strategy for integration of wind energy conversion systems (WECS) into the electrical distribution networks with particular attention to the combined provision of energy and ancillary services. Typically, a WECS is composed by a variable speed wind turbine coupled with a direct driven permanent magnet (DDPM) synchronous generator. This configuration offers a considerable flexibility in design and operation of the power unit, as its output is delivered to the grid through a fully controlled frequency converter. Here, a new control scheme to regulate electrical and mechanical quantities of such generation unit is proposed, aimed both at reaching optimal performances in terms of power delivered to the grid and at providing the voltage support ancillary service at the point of common coupling. The control scheme is derived resorting to the feedback linearization (FBL) technique, which allows both decoupling and linearization of a non linear multiple input multiple output system. Several numerical simulations are then performed in order to show how the flexibility of the DDPM wind generator can be fully exploited, thanks to the use of the FBL approach, which assures independent control of each variable and significant simplifications in controller synthesis and system operation, thus making it easier to integrate WECS into modern day smart grids. © 2011 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "This paper is focused on the evaluation of the benefits (environmental/technical) expected from the improvement of transmission and distribution infrastructures with the introduction of specific state-of-the-art technologies. This issue is presently much debated both at industrial and at scientific level, since worldwide measures are taken to lower the environmental impact of energy supply systems, in particular with regard to climate change [1 - 3]. Grids can be renewed by resorting basically to six interventions: 1. Replacement/refurbishment of power components; 2. Wide area measurement, monitoring and control systems (WAMS/WACS), upgrading protection and control devices for communication; 3. Increase of voltage level; 4. Installation of power quality devices (Distribution Networks); 5. High voltage direct current transmission systems - HVDC (line and forced commutated); 6. Flexible AC transmission systems - FACTS (Transmission Networks). In this work, the attention is concentrated on the application of FACTS to modern networks and the quantification of their impact on the achievement of the EU energy targets for the year 2020 [4], including improved efficiency, improved renewable generation penetration and improved environmental compatibility (basically linked to CO<inf>2</inf>emissions reduction). Our attention will focus on the use of FACTS devices and the installation of newer and more efficient components. We won't deal with the problem of increasing the rate voltage as the proposed model for the network is in \"per unit\", so it is valid for every voltage level. Three main scenarios are investigated: in the first one, the aim is to find an optimal condition of the power system, in which the insertion of FACTS can contribute to increase the overall efficiency; in the second one, the capability of FACTS to enable the integration of a certain amount of power generated via renewable resources into a grid operating in a critical asset (transmission lines at their capacity limits) is analyzed; in the third one, the optimization of the generating scheduling of different power plants connected to the grid to obtain an optimum power set-points configuration for each unit from an environmental point of view is discussed. In this last analysis scenario, one has to characterize the different power plants emissions and relate them with the power produced, then generate the set-points with an 'environmental oriented' dispatching procedure and employ FACTS to reach the desired configuration.",

      "abstract": "The work developed and proposed in this paper deals with innovative control schemes applied to synchronous generators. In particular, the FeedBack Linearization (FBL) technique and the Sliding Mode (SM) method have been applied to regulate voltage and electric power. To do this, the basic equations of the generator have been re-formulated into the so-called normal form and, next, a proper state transformation and a suitable control law have been defined. Starting from this form, the SM algorithm has then been used in order to take into account possible model and parametric uncertainties. Several tests have been performed to highlight merits and drawbacks of both techniques, compared with the traditional regulation scheme. © 2011 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "In the first part of this paper, the rigorous theory describing the electromagnetic field radiated by a lightning return stroke over a two-layered conducting ground was presented and the exact expressions for the lightning electromagnetic fields were developed and discussed. In this part of the paper, the theory along with its time domain numerical evaluation algorithm is used for the assessment of the validity of simplified approaches proposed in the literature for the vertical electric and horizontal magnetic field components. The simplified approaches are based on the concept of ground surface impedance and its corresponding attenuation function. It is shown that the results obtained using the simplified approaches are in excellent agreement with exact results in both near (50 m) and intermediate (1000 m) distance range. However, since the vertical electric and azimuthal magnetic field components are not appreciably affected by the ground finite conductivity, they can also be evaluated assuming the ground as a perfectly conducting ground. On the other hand, the horizontal electric field above a horizontally stratified ground is very much affected by the ground electrical parameters. Its waveform is characterized by an early negative excursion due to the currents flowing into the ground followed by a late time positive excursion which is due to the elevation of the observation point from the ground level. The magnitude of the negative peak is sharper for subsequent return strokes than first return strokes and is higher for lower conducting grounds. A new formula is proposed for the evaluation of the horizontal electric field at a given height above the air-ground interface. The formula can be viewed as the generalization of the Cooray-Rubinstein formula for the case of a two-layer ground. We show that the new formula is able to reproduce in a satisfactory manner the horizontal electric field above a two-layer ground. The proposed formulation is, however, less accurate at distances as close to 10 m from the channel base and for very poor ground conductivity (0.0001 S/m).

The proposed method is based on a suitable modification of a previously developed model for the evaluation of the fields in the presence of a lossy but homogeneous soil. Particular attention is devoted to the soil reflection coefficient properties, both from a physical and from a mathematical point of view.

This configuration offers a considerable flexibility in design and operation, as the output of the generator is delivered to the grid through a fully controlled frequency converter. In this paper, a new control strategy for this generation unit is presented, based on the Feed Back Linearization (FBL), a technique that allows both decoupling and linearization of a non linear multiple input multiple output (MIMO) system. The mathematical model for the control synthesis is derived, and simulation results are presented in order to show how the flexibility of the DDPM Wind Generator can be fully exploited thanks to the independent control of each variable performed with our approach. Moreover, both controller synthesis and system operation can be greatly simplified, thus making it easier to integrate this wind energy conversion system (WECS) in modern day smart grids.",

      "abstract": "This paper is aimed at analyzing the influence of the frequency-dependent behavior of the ground electrical parameters (conductivity and ground permittivity) on the electromagnetic field radiated by a cloud-to-ground lightning return stroke. Both radiation in air (over the conducting ground plane) and underground are considered in the analysis. The adopted method is based on the classical Sommerfeld's theory and takes advantage of an efficient ad hoc numerical procedure to face with the slow converging Sommerfeld's integrals. This feature allows the electromagnetic field to be computed without any sort of mathematical approximation and, since it is carried out in the frequency domain, can be used either if the ground permittivity and conductivity are considered constant or if they vary with the working frequency with any functional law. Simulations have been performed to identify the cases in which the approximation of constant ground permittivity and conductivity leads to satisfactory results. It is shown that for soils with water contents of 2% to 10% (ground conductivities in the order of 0.001 to 0.01 S/m), the assumption of constant electrical parameters appears to be reasonable. However, for either very poorly conducting soils (10<sup>-4</sup> S/m or so) or highly conducting soils (10<sup>-1</sup> S/m), the electromagnetic field components appear to be significantly affected by the frequency dependence of the ground electrical parameters.

      "abstract": "Investigation of faults in electric power systems is of primary relevance for planning and operation: contingency occurrence analysis finds, for instance, specific application in protection system design, security assessment and economical impact evaluation. Loss of generation is surely one of the most severe outage affecting power systems: all the aspects quoted above are linked to generation management throughout the grid. Concerning the protection system, in particular, it is essential to counteract generator faults efficiently both to prevent cascading events in the electric grid, and to avoid severe damages to generators and related long out of service. Standard approaches for analysis of network faults are well known, whereas additional work could be specifically done for generator fault modelling and detection. From this point of view, internal faults are of particular concern as unexpected fault paths and current amounts could sometime arise, leading to protection malfunctioning and misdetection [1-2]. In literature, some models have been set up [3-7], but further developments can be done especially for what concerns input parameters, not always easily available, and sensitivity to fault location. The paper proposes an extended model of the synchronous machine suitable for a generalised analysis of internal faults, accounting for stator windings with multiple paralleled paths for phase. The main aims and properties of the here presented simulation model are: input parameters as derived from either the electromagnetic design or experimental identification of the generator; fault current computation for variable location, along a winding path, of internal (single or multiple) phase to ground, phase to neutral or phase to phase faults; evidence of selective contributions to fault currents from the different paths of the stator windings; comparison and link between internal fault currents and ones detected by conventional protection schemes.",

The derivation of the Green functions necessary to solve the problem is discussed in detail, and the determination of the expressions for the electromagnetic field components is carried out in a form that minimizes the final computational costs. A method for the numerical evaluation of the electromagnetic field is then proposed, and it is shown that it can be used starting from any \"engineering model\" representation for the lightning current distribution along the channel. Such method is based on a new efficient evaluation of the so-called Sommerfeld's integrals appearing in the electromagnetic field expressions, without resorting to any kind of approximated formulas for them. The numerical treatment of the Sommerfeld's integrals is characterized by a proper subdivision of the integration domain, the use of the Romberg technique and the determination of a suitable upper bound for the error due to the integral truncation. In the second part of this work it will be shown how the results provided by the developed theory can be used in order to assess the validity of the most common simplified approach for the calculation of the lightning radiation over a lossy ground plane.

      "abstract": "In this paper, the developed formulation, which we shall call the \"reference\" one, is used to assess the validity of the most popular simplified approach for the calculation of the lightning electromagnetic field over a conducting earth, namely, the Cooray-Rubinstein (CR) approximation. This formula provides a simple method to evaluate the radial component of the electric field which is the component most affected by the finite ground conductivity and which plays an important role within the Agrawal et al. (1980) field-to-transmission line-coupling model. Several configurations are examined, with different values for the ground conductivity and different field observation points. A thorough analysis of all the simulated field components is carried out and comparisons are also made with the \"ideal\" field, namely, the field that would be present under the assumption of perfectly conducting ground. It is shown that for channel base current typical of subsequent strokes and for very low conductivities, the CR formula exhibits some deviations from the reference one but it still represents a conservative estimation of the radial field component, since it behaves as un upper bound for the exact curve. The developed algorithm is characterized by fast performances in terms of CPU time, lending itself to be used for several applications, including a coupling code for lightning induced overvoltages calculations.

      "abstract": "The number of power installations lying underground has been increasing in the last few years, and such devices are very sensitive to the effect of the lightning electromagnetic fields, due to the massive presence of power electronics. As a consequence, the scientific community has devoted much effort in the direction of a more accurate modeling of underground lightning fields and their coupling to cables. The exact expressions of the underground lightning fields have been derived by Sommerfeld decades ago. However, their numerical evaluation has always been a hard task because of the presence of slowly converging improper integrals. In the past, some approximate formulas have been derived, which have been included in field-to-transmission line coupling models to estimate the effect of lightning on buried cables. In this paper, an efficient algorithm for the evaluation of the Sommerfeld expression for underground fields is presented, and its mathematical features are discussed. The numerical treatment of the Sommerfeld integrals is based on a proper subdivision of the integration domain, the application of the Romberg technique, and the definition of a suitable upper bound for the error due to the integral truncation. The remarkable efficiency in terms of CPU time of the developed algorithm makes it possible to use it directly in field-to-buried cable coupling simulation codes. Finally, the developed algorithm is used to test the validity of the Cooray's simplified formula for the computation of underground horizontal electric field. It is shown that predictions of the Cooray's formula are in good agreement with exact solutions for large values of ground conductivity (0.01.S/m). However, for poor conductivities (0.001 S/m or so), Cooray's expression yields less satisfactory results, especially for the late time response. © 2007 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "This paper deals with the evaluation of lightning electromagnetic fields inside a finitely conducting ground. We present a comparison between three different approaches that have been adopted by researchers dealing with lightning electromagnetic effects. The first is the Cooray Formula in which, the equations of lightning generated electromagnetic fields below the ground surface are connected to surface fields that can easily be determined. The second approach recently proposed by Delfino et al. consists of numerically evaluating the exact field expressions. Finally, the third approach is based on a numerical solution of Maxwell's equations using the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method. Two different values for the ground conductivity, namely 0.01 S/m and 0.001 S/m are considered in the computations. The adopted model for the return stroke is the Modified Transmission Line model with Exponential decay (MTLE). The results obtained using Delfino et al. algorithm and those obtained using FDTD are virtually identical. It is also shown that the Cooray formula is able to reproduce with a very good accuracy the underground fields, especially for their earlytime response. ©2007 IEEE.",

Sommerfeld derived the exact expression for such field, but, unfortunately, its numerical evaluation has always represented a hard task because of slowly converging improper integrals. To face this problem, some approximate formulas have been derived in a recent past in order to quantify the effect of lightning disturbances on underground cables. However, at present, there are not any results available in literature concerning the exact formulation for the underground lightning fields. In this paper, an efficient algorithm for such exact computations is proposed starting from Sommerfeld’s theory and some comparative tests are made to validate the most common approximate approach.",

The governing system of integro-differential equations is solved by means of a numerical procedure based on a Fourier series transformation. It can be proved that the series in which the unknowns of the problem, namely the currents along the conductors, are developed converge to the exact solution and only few terms are needed. The obtained results have been compared with those of a widely employed scattering code, showing faster performances for a given accuracy. Therefore, the algorithm can be seen as a more accurate alternative to the classical transmission line theory (TL) for all the situations (short transmission line, interconnects, etc.) in which the line geometrical parameters and the frequencies of interest make TL a rough approximation.",

      "abstract": "One of the most significant lightning-related quantities is the return stroke current, which is defined as the spatial and temporal distribution of the lightning current after the contact between the leader of the discharge and the ground is established. Gaining information about the return stroke current is of prime importance for the general investigation into the lightning physics as well as for the determination of the correct expression of the electromagnetic field associated with the phenomenon. In this paper we propose an inverse procedure for the reconstruction of the proper waveform of the return stroke current, starting from the measurement of the vertical component of the electric field it produces at different locations on the ground and making use of the integral equation expressing the link between field and current. The ground is assumed to be conductive, and the general Sommerfeld's theory for the vertical antenna radiation over a lossy half-space is adopted for the calculation of the field. It is shown that the unknown current distribution along the channel can be identified if it is suitably expanded by means of a modified basis of Chebyshev polynomials. The proposed approach is validated by means of the numerical simulation of the classical MTLE (Modified Transmission Line Exponential) engineering model, and an analysis on the role played by ground conductivity in the identification process is carried out.",

Such assumptions determine restrictions on the maximum value of line height and width with respect both to the line length and to the minimum field wavelength.

Three versions of this procedure have been developed: in the first, the identification is carried out by means of the measurement of the electric field at various distances from the lightning channel at a given frequency; in the second, only two sensors for the electric field are necessary, but various sampling frequencies; in the third, only one observation point is needed, for the measurement of both the electric and the magnetic field.

      "abstract": "The evaluation of the total force of magnetic origin acting upon a body in a stationary magnetic field is often carried out using the so-called magnetic energy (or co-energy) method, which is based on the derivation of the magnetic energy (or co-energy) with respect to a virtual rigid displacement of the considered body. The application of this method is usually justified by resorting to the energy conservation principle written in terms both of electrical and of mechanical quantities. In this paper we shall re-examine the whole matter in the context of classical thermodynamics, in order to obtain a more comprehensive and general proof of the validity of the energy (or co-energy) approach and to point out its limitations. Two typical configurations will be discussed; in the first one, the field sources are represented by conducting bodies carrying free currents, whereas in the second one a permanent magnet creates the driving field. All magnetic materials are assumed to be non-hysteretic and permanent magnets are represented by means of the well-known linear model in the second quadrant of the (B,H) plane.",
