      "abstract": "This study presents an experimental approach to study the dynamics of tip vortex cavitation. The selected case study is a four-bladed model-scale controllable pitch propeller tested under specific flow and operational conditions. The proposed method integrates high-speed video recordings with advanced computer vision techniques to quantitatively assess the characteristics of cavitating vortex dynamics, focusing in particular on the variation of vortex volume as a function of the propeller blade’s angular position. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach enables precise measurements of vortex dynamics, offering valuable insights for future investigations. Specifically, direct access to these measurements may facilitate the study of how vortex cavitation dynamics influence the spectral characteristics of radiated noise. Such insights are crucial for developing and validating underwater noise spectrum predictive models that comprehensively describe the noise sources.",

      "abstract": "In the last years, an increasing attention has been devoted to ships Underwater Radiated Noise (URN), with the progressive introduction of noise reduction Guidelines by international organizations such as IMO, Classification Societies voluntary notations, limits and incentives in specific areas. In this context, a large effort has been spent in the study of cavitating propeller noise since it represents the dominating noise source on ships. Over the years, the University of Genoa has developed strategies for propeller design by optimisation aimed to the reduction of cavitation and noise as a side effect, limiting possible negative consequences on the propulsion efficiency. In the context of the EU-funded LIFE-PIAQUO project it was possible to perform a complete optimisation activity, starting from a real test case (a small passenger boat operating in Mediterranean marine protected areas) and retrofitting the propellers for dedicated sea trials. The present paper reports the main results of these activities, highlighting the capability of the proposed methods, through a comparative full-scale validation of the outcomes of the design activity.",

      "abstract": "The noise radiated by ship propellers can be studied by analyzing scaled models in a cavitation tunnel. However, transferring the measurements made in the enclosed space of the tunnel to the expected values in a full-scale propeller (in a free field) presents a challenge for noise measurements. An acoustic characterization of the DITEN cavitation tunnel, including a study of normal modes and acoustic response to harmonic sources, is presented to understand the primary acoustic behaviour of the enclosure and its propagation characteristics. A three-dimensional numerical model was developed to simulate the DITEN Genoa University cavitation tunnel and evaluate the influence of elements such as a dynamometer, fins, impeller, and source position on the acoustic response of the tunnel. The study showed the influence of the mentioned elements on the acoustic response of the tunnel, and the numerical predictions were validated by comparing them with the experimental campaign in the low-mid frequency range. The study provides valuable insights into the behaviour of sound waves in a cavitation tunnel and the influence of various factors, which can help design and optimize cavitation tunnels and related experiments.",

      "abstract": "The present study aims to investigate the fundamental dynamics of cavitation through an experimental approach. The study involves developing and testing a computer vision technique to measure the critical characteristics of a cavitation state. The experimental campaign was designed to investigate the dynamics of bubble cavitation developing on a NACA 0015 hydrofoil. The hydrofoil was tested under working conditions with an angle of attack of zero and a flow velocity of V=8[m/s]. The experiments were performed for several cavitation numbers, acquiring a dataset of high-speed videos for each. These videos were analysed using the methodology presented to extract quantitative data that described the observed cavitation state. The article describes each phase of the developed technique in detail, illustrating step by step the solutions adopted to solve the problems faced. The analyses’ results highlight the potential of this approach. Indeed, the characteristic features of the cavitation conditions were measured with high accuracy. These quantities are difficult to access using the techniques commonly used to observe cavitation. The results provide valuable insight for an in-depth understanding of the cavitation phenomenon and the detrimental effects it generates.",

Standard cameras are fixed on the top of test section to continuously monitor the effect of erosion damage on the blade root, the high-speed camera has been placed at different positions to investigate detailed evolution and collapse of bubbles on pressure and suction side of propeller blades. Soft paint results showing damages pattern have been analysed simultaneously with the high speed videos, and showed remarkable agreement between the occurrence of damage on the blades and the bubble collapse of cavitation. The proposed methodology allows comparing different propellers in terms of cavitation aggressiveness. The comparison of these results with full-scale data provides useful indications to propeller designers when root cavitation cannot be avoided.",

      "abstract": "In the context of numerical self-propulsion predictions, the literature on high-speed marine vehicles (HSMV) is still relatively scarce. Actually, extensive numerical analyses are rarely considered for these applications because of the not-so-stringent design constraints and contract requirements concerning these crafts and also thanks to the advantages of series production. On the contrary, with the growth of the market requests, in particular, in the direction of Greenhouse Gas Reduction, the exact knowledge of the vessel working point, in terms of speed and engine configuration, pushes the researchers to investigate all the factors which deeply define the propulsion condition. In the present paper, two existing vessels have been numerically studied using a robust and industrially affordable procedure based on some simplified viscous Computational Fluid Dynamic approaches to predict the self-propulsion working points. The obtained results have been then compared with available sea trials showing a very high agreement even if some uncertainties in both the experimental measurements and the CFD results still exist. The impact of these uncertainties has been further investigated to assess the reliability of the self-propulsion prediction, showing that the maximum speed can be obtained with an uncertainty of about 1 knot and 10% of the corresponding engine load. A more robust prediction can be obtained by including the uncertainty assessment in the propulsion analyses. The validity of the proposed analyses is further supported because the numerical uncertainty falls inside the uncertainty obtained from the available full-scale measurements, so defining a more robust prediction of the vessel propulsion point for design purposes.",

The complete 3-D flow field has been measured considering four transverse sections at different longitudinal locations, from upstream to downstream of the propeller, focusing on the near field wake. A longitudinal plane containing the propeller shaft has been considered as well. A dedicated interpolation technique is presented to improve the spatial resolution of data and allow advanced analyses.

      "abstract": "For propeller-driven vessels, cavitation is the most dominant noise source producing both structure-borne and radiated noise impacting wildlife, passenger comfort, and underwater warfare. Physically plausible and accurate predictions of the underwater radiated noise at design stage, i.e., for previously untested geometries and operating conditions, are fundamental for designing silent and efficient propellers. State-of-the-art predictive models are based on physical, data-driven, and hybrid approaches. Physical models (PMs) meet the need for physically plausible predictions but are either too computationally demanding or not accurate enough at design stage. Data-driven models (DDMs) are computationally inexpensive ad accurate on average but sometimes produce physically implausible results. Hybrid models (HMs) combine PMs and DDMs trying to take advantage of their strengths while limiting their weaknesses but state-of-the-art hybridisation strategies do not actually blend them, failing to achieve the HMs full potential. In this work, for the first time, we propose a novel HM that recursively correct a state-of-the-art PM by means of a DDM which simultaneously exploits the prior physical knowledge in the definition of its feature set and the data coming from a vast experimental campaign at the Emerson Cavitation Tunnel on the Meridian standard propeller series behind different severities of the axial wake. Results in different extrapolating conditions, i.e., extrapolation with respect to propeller rotational speed, wakefield, and geometry, will support our proposal both in terms of accuracy and physical plausibility.",

      "abstract": "Scaled models are implemented to study the radiated noise from the ships' propellers. Typically, acoustic measurements are performed inside a cavitation tunnel using those scaled models of the propeller. This work aims to present a modal acoustic characterization of the cavitation tunnel of the DITEN department of the University of Genoa in the low-frequency zone (i.e., below 1 kHz). A three-dimensional numerical model was used to simulate the tunnel, helping to understand the enclosure's modal behavior. Normal modes were classified using the modes for a toroidal-like enclosure. As expected, the modal density increases for each third-octave band, making it possible to determine the frequency limit where the behavior of the tunnel changes from modal to diffuse.",

      "abstract": "The potential impact of underwater radiated noise from maritime operations on marine fauna has become an important issue. The most dominant noise source on a propeller-driven vessel is propeller cavitation, producing both structure-borne and radiated noise, with a broad spectrum that covers a wide range of frequencies. To ensure acceptable noise levels for sustainable shipping, accurate prediction of the noise signature is essential, and procedures able to provide a reliable estimate of propeller cavitation noise are becoming a fundamental tool of the design process. In this work, we investigate the potential of using computationally cheap methods for the prediction of underwater radiated noise from cavitating marine propellers. We compare computational and experimental results on a subset of the Meridian standard propeller series, behind different severities of axial wake, for a total of 432 experiments. The results indicate that the approaches employed can be a convenient solution for noise analysis during the design process.",

Tests are carried out in a cavitation tunnel, using the soft paint technique to study cavitation erosion, exploiting also two standard cameras and one high speed camera to study the damage patterns and cavitation dynamics, respectively. Standard cameras are placed on the top of test section in order to periodically monitor the occurrence of damages on the layer of paint. The high-speed camera has been used instead to analyse bubble dynamics and identify potentially erosive phenomena. Three different cavitation bubble structures on the blade root have been identified in the present study: streak cavitation, spherical bubble cavitation, and twisting bubble cavitation. The paint tests results have been analysed together with high-speed videos, showing a remarkable agreement between the occurrence of damage and cavitation collapse phenomena. The results demonstrated two regions on the propeller blade root with high risk of erosion: (1) suction side blade root showed significant damage pattern due to single bubble as well as bubble assembly collapse, and (2) pressure side blade root showed slight damage pattern due to spherical bubble collapse.",

      "abstract": "Propeller-induced cavitation dominates the underwater radiated noise emitted by ships, presenting a significant threat to marine ecosystems. Designing mitigation strategies for noise pollution requires predictive models, which are challenging to develop due to the varied, multiscale, and multi-physical nature of the phenomenon. One technique for predicting the propeller cavitation noise source that is rising in popularity relies on the use of computation fluid dynamics (CFD) solutions of the cavitating flow with a volume-of-fluid cavitation model. We measured cavitation induced noise from ten loading conditions of a model-scale controllable pitch propeller in uniform inflow, resulting in four distinct regimes of cavitation. These experimental conditions were reproduced numerically using the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) framework, facilitating direct comparison between the experimental and the numerical results. Vapour cavities attached to propeller blades were adequately simulated, while regimes involving cavities within shed vortices were not reproduced well. The numerical model effectively predicted the qualitative trends of acoustic spectra, but the absolute sound levels were over-predicted. These results provide insight into the necessary components of a successful propeller noise model and outline the advantages and shortcomings of the present numerical framework.",

      "abstract": "Off–design and realistic operative conditions of the propulsion system have been progressively considered a frontier topic for the development of novel and successful design procedures. The availability of high accurate data on propeller performance, both experimental or numerical, is pivotal for the development of reliable tools and the enhancement of traditional ones. In this context, this paper continues the investigation described in (Ortolani et al., 2020), that was dedicated to analyze the single blade loads obtained by oblique towing tests and assess their consistency with those measured during the steady turning phase, reproduced by free running model tests. In this paper, the same analysis is broadened to two aspects. At first, the in–plane forces and moments that are obtained by a conversion from the rotating frame of the measure to the fixed frame are discussed. These loads need quantification, because they are the primary cause of damages of the shafting structure, vibratory loads and also contribute to dynamic response of the ship. Then, the study is switched to the comparison of single blade loads during transient motions of the turning maneuvers, at weak and tight rudder angles, performed at the same reference speed as the captive model test. The analysis lays the basis for the enhancement of ship system (comprehensive) mathematical models, already used in ship design, to real–time analysis of vibratory loads and emitted noise.",

      "abstract": "There has been an increasing attention to the effect of hull roughness on ship resistance and powering. In conventional studies, the hull surfaces have been treated as uniform rough surfaces while the real ships' hulls are exposed heterogeneous fouling accumulation. The work described here presents an experimental investigation into the effect of heterogeneous hull roughness on ship resistance. A series of towing tests were conducted using a ship model of the Wigley hull with various hull roughness conditions, including homogeneous conditions (i.e. smooth and full-rough conditions) and heterogeneous conditions (i.e. ¼-bow-rough, ¼-aft-rough, ½-bow-rough and ½-aft-rough conditions). The bow-rough conditions (e.g. ¼-bow-rough and ½-bow-rough) showed larger added resistance than aft-rough conditions (e.g. ¼-aft-rough and ½-aft-rough) with the same wetted surface area of the rough region. This finding suggests that the hull roughness of the forward part of the hull is more significant than the others in terms of the added resistance. Finally, a new method was proposed to predict the added resistance due to the heterogeneous hull roughness based on Granville's similarity law scaling and the predictions were compared with the experimental result.",

      "abstract": "Mitigation of shipping noise is a topical issue in marine engineering because of the dramatic increase in the levels of anthropogenic underwater noise and its impact on marine life. In recent years, hydro-acoustic research has focussed on the development of reliable methods for predicting underwater radiated noise (URN) due to cavitation, which is known to be the dominant contribution to the overall radiated noise spectrum of ships above the cavitation inception threshold. Model-scale measurements are currently considered the most reliable approach to study URN problems in marine engineering and are crucial for the verification and validation of numerical methods. However, their reliability is affected by several uncertainty sources for which suitable test procedures and post-processing techniques are needed. As a means to better understand the accuracy and reliability of underwater radiated noise measurements, a round-robin (RR) test programme for an open water propeller setup was organized within the Community-of-Practice “Noise” of the HydroTesting Forum, with the aim of comparing results among several institutes (i.e. University of Genova UNIGE, University of Newcastle UNEW, NMRI, SSPA, KRISO, CNR-INM and MARIN). This paper reports an overview of the RR programme and compares the different approaches and results.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents the preliminary results of a numerical study for noise prediction of a benchmark propeller in open water/uniform flow conditions. The experimental benchmark test data for the research vessel, “The Princess Royal”, were used for validation purposes. The numerical analyses were implemented by using a viscous solver based on the finite volume method while the experimental data were obtained from model tests conducted at the Genova University Cavitation Tunnel. The main aim of the study is to predict propeller hydro-acoustic performance under cavitating conditions. The hydrodynamic flow field was solved using a RANS (Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes) solver. The Schnerr-Sauer cavitation model based on a reduced Rayleigh-Plesset equation together with a VOF approach was used to model sheet cavitation on the propeller blades. The computed hydrodynamic characteristics and sheet cavity patterns were shown to be in good agreement with the Genoa experimental data, thus providing a firm basis for cavitating noise predictions. The hydro-acoustic performance of the model propeller was predicted by using a hybrid method. In the noise simulations, RANS equations were equipped with a porous FW-H (Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings) formulation. The different propeller operational conditions were simulated using this hybrid method. The numerical results were also validated with the experimental data for the propeller hydro-acoustic performance. Whereas such validations showed promising results by means of overall noise spectrum with the benchmark test cases in the low-frequency range, the numerical prediction overestimated the 1st BPF values (around 20 dB) in five loading conditions. Besides, in some loading conditions, especially between 200 and 800 Hz, the difference between numerical predictions and the experiment was found around 5–10 dB.",

      "abstract": "The importance of reducing the noise impact of ships is being recognised worldwide. Consequently, the inclusion of this principle among the objectives and constraints of new designs is becoming a standard. For this reason, considerable attention is given to the propeller being often the dominant source of underwater radiated noise, especially when cavitation occurs, as it happens in most cases when a ship sails at design speed. The designers of quieter propulsion systems require the availability of predictive tools able to verify the compliance with noise requirements and to compare the effectiveness of different design solutions. In this context, tools able to provide a reliable estimate of propeller noise spectra based just on the information available during propeller design represent a fundamental tool to speed up the design process avoiding model scale tests. This work focuses on developing a tool able to predict the cavitating marine propeller generated noise spectra at design stage exploiting the most recent advances in Deep Learning, able to take advantage of both structured and unstructured data, and in hybrid modelling, able to exploit both data and physical knowledge about the problem. For this purpose authors will make use of a dataset collected by means of dedicated model scale measurements in a cavitation tunnel combined with the detailed flow characterisation obtainable by calculations carried out with a Boundary Element Method. The performance of the proposed approaches are analysed considering different scenarios and different definitions of the input and output variable used during the modelisation.",

      "abstract": "Reducing the noise impact of ships on the marine environment is one of the objectives of new propellers designs, since they represent the dominant source of underwater radiated noise, especially when cavitation occurs. Consequently, ship designers require new predictive tools able to verify the compliance with noise requirements and to compare the effectiveness of different design solutions. In this context, tools able to provide a reliable estimate of propeller noise spectra based just on the information available at design stage represent a fundamental tool to speed up the design process avoiding model scale tests. This work focus on developing such a tool, adopting methods coming from the world of Machine Learning and Deep Neural Networks, in order to create a model able to predict the cavitating marine propeller noise spectra. For this purpose authors will make use of a dataset collected by means of dedicated model scale measurements in a cavitation tunnel combined with the detailed flow characterization obtainable by calculations carried out with a Boundary Element Method. The performance of the proposed approaches are analyzed considering different definitions of the input and output variables used during the modelization.",

      "abstract": "Ducted propellers are unconventional systems that are usually adopted for ship propulsion. These devices have recently been studied with medium-fidelity computational fluid dynamics code (based on the potential flow hypothesis) with promising results. However, these tools, even though they provide a good prediction of the forces and moments generated by the blades and the duct, are not able to provide insight into the flow field characteristics due to their crude flow approximations. On the contrary, modern high-fidelity viscous-based computational fluid dynamics codes could give a better description of the near and far-field flow of these particular devices. In the present paper, forces and the most significant features of the flow field around two ducted propellers are analyzed by means of both experimental and computational fluid dynamics approaches. In particular, accelerating and decelerating ducts are considered, and we demonstrate the ability of the adopted solver to accurately predict the performance and the flow field for both types. These results, in particular for the less-studied decelerating duct, designate CFD as a useful tool for reliable designs.",

      "abstract": "Maneuvering motion is a critical off-design condition experienced by the propeller during realistic operations. Failures of the propulsive system, loss of efficiency and modification of the propeller side effects (propeller-hull induced pressure and noise) are the undesired consequences of these working conditions. Free running model tests, still representing the primary approach for a reliable performance assessment, requires facilities and devices that are not commonly affordable; alternatively, rectilinear towing tank can be used for maneuvering investigations by static or dynamic tests and can be a valid alternative to investigate propeller performance in off-design. On these basis, in this paper the propeller performance in maneuvering conditions is investigated by means of oblique towing tests in case of a twin screw model equipped with a novel set-up for single blade loads measurements.In the experiments, the drift angle and the advance speed of the model varied systematically, to focus on the relation between propeller operating conditions and loads. Moreover, the averaged and periodic blade loads are compared, in terms of the equivalent drift angle, to the measurements obtained by free running model tests, in order to demonstrate the reliability of pure oblique flow tests for the preliminary quantification of the off-design loads developed by the propeller.",

      "abstract": "Achieving a reliable and accurate numerical prediction of the self-propulsion performance of a ship is still an open problem that poses some relevant issues. Several CFD methods, ranging from boundary element methods (BEM) to higher-fidelity viscous Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) based solvers, can be used to accurately analyze the separate problems, i.e. the open water propeller and the hull calm water resistance. However, when the fully-coupled self-propulsion problem is considered, i.e. the hull advancing at uniform speed propelled by its own propulsion system, several complexities rise up. Typical flow simplifications adopted to speed-up the simulations of the single analysis (hull and propeller separately) lose their validity requiring a more complex solver to tackle the fully-coupled problem. The complexity rises up further when considering a maneuver condition. This aspect increases the computational burden and, consequently, the required time which becomes prohibitive in a preliminary ship design stage. The majority of the simplified methods proposed in literature to include propeller effects, without directly solve the propeller flow, in a high-fidelity viscous solver are not able to provide all the commonly required self-propulsion coefficients. In this work, a new method to enrich the results from a body force based approach is proposed and investigated, with the aim to reduce as much as possible the computational burden without losing any useful result. This procedure is tested for validation on the KCS hull form in self-propulsion and maneuver conditions.",

      "abstract": "In the latest years, models combining physical knowledge of a phenomenon and statistical inference are becoming of much interest in many real world applications. In this context, ship propeller underwater radiated noise is an interesting field of application for these so-called hybrid models, especially when the propeller cavitates. Nowadays, model scale tests are considered the state-of-the-art technique to predict the cavitation noise spectra. Unfortunately, they are negatively affected by scale effects which could alter the onset of some interesting cavitating phenomena respect to the full scale propeller; as a consequence, for some ship operational conditions it is not trivial to correctly reproduce the cavitation pattern in model scale tests. Moreover, model scale tests are quite expensive and time-consuming; it is not feasible to include them in the early stage of the design. Nevertheless, data collected during these tests can be adopted in order to tune a data-driven model while the physical equation describing the occurring phenomenon can be used to refine the prediction. In this work, the authors propose a hybrid model for the prediction of ships propeller underwater radiated noise, able to exploit both the physical knowledge of the problem and the real data obtained from cavitation tunnel experiments performed on different propellers in different working conditions. Results on real data will support the validity and the effectiveness of the proposal.",

Despite this, the acquirement of consistent data of propeller noise from tests in model scale facilities is still a challenging task. Data collected with such an approach are usually affected by several scale effects and facility related issues which make such experiments still very complex. Among others, the effect of the facility itself as acoustical surrounding must be carefully addressed in order to properly estimate propeller source levels in ideal free field conditions. This is currently carried out, when possible, by measuring facility transfer functions and applying such functions as a correction to measured noise spectra. The development of robust procedures for the measurement of these transfer functions is thus very important.

      "abstract": "Ships underwater radiated noise is a subject of great and increasing interest in naval architecture because of its impacts on the environment and on the on-board comfort. Among the different noise sources, the propeller is usually the dominant one, especially when it cavitates. For this reason a lot of efforts have been spent in studying the cavitation noise spectra in order to be able to predict its main characteristics at design stage. Nowadays, in order to reach this goal, the state-of-the-art solution is to perform model scale experiments. Unfortunately, this requires time-consuming tests in a cavitation tunnel with a model of the propeller and results are affected by scale effects that must be correctly interpreted. For these reasons, in this paper authors propose a hybrid approach which may be adopted to predict the main characteristics of the cavitation noise spectra without requiring an actual experiment. Moreover, the same approach may be used also in order to overcome typical model scale problems. For this purpose a hybrid modelling approach able to exploit both the physical knowledge of the problem and the real data obtained from many cavitation tunnel experiments performed on different propellers in different working conditions have been developed. Results on real data in both interpolation and extrapolation tasks will support the validity and the effectiveness of the proposal.",

      "abstract": "Propeller noise, especially in the presence of cavitation, is usually the main contributor to the acoustic signature of ships. Due to this fact, considerable efforts have been devoted to the study of underwater radiated noise induced by propeller cavitation during years: firstly, for military reasons; more recently, for other reasons relevant for merchant vessels, such as comfort on board and mitigation of the undesired impacts on marine fauna. Different approaches are available for the study and prediction of the cavitation noise, including statistical and CFD based methods as well as approaches based on model tests in cavitation tunnels or depressurised tanks. Amongst these approaches, the model test based approach is still the most reliable and commonly adopted method. However, when the aim of the model experiments is the prediction of noise radiated by a full-size ship, scale effects need to be analysed and taken into account to interpret model scale data and to achieve consistent prediction. Within this framework, each testing facility follows a procedure, which is developed through its own experience, theoretical considerations and possibly semi-empirical approaches to manage the different possible issues. The definition and harmonisations of the standards for the noise test and post-processing procedures of the propeller noise are still within the current tasks of the ITTC Specialist Committee on Hydrodynamic Noise and other standardization institutes. This results in more uncertainty compared to other more established tests such as resistance and self-propulsion. This paper presents the model scale tests carried out at the University of Genova (UNIGE) cavitation tunnel on the model propeller of the Newcastle University research catamaran, “The Princess Royal”. Tests have been carried out using a 2D wake screen to approximate the real ship condition. The details of the experimental setup and results are presented and compared with the full-scale measurements in terms of cavitation and underwater radiated noise. This allows to explore the issues of the scale effects associated with these phenomena, focusing the attention on possible problems related to small-medium size cavitation tunnel.",

      "abstract": "The study of ship underwater radiated noise is nowadays a topic of great and largely recognized importance. This is due to the fact that in the last decades, the problem of the impact of anthropogenic noise on marine life has been addressed with higher emphasis, giving rise to different efforts aimed to the analysis of its effects on different organisms and, in parallel, to means for the reduction of shipping noise. In this context, attention is focused on the propeller noise, which, in cavitating conditions, may represent the most important noise source of the ship. The propeller noise has been studied for long time with different approaches. One of the most effective approaches is represented by model scale testing in cavitation tunnels or similar facilities. Despite having been adopted for several years, radiated noise experiments in model scale are usually affected by significant scale effects and technical issues. One of these aspects is represented by the correct modelling of the propeller inflow; different techniques are adopted, depending on the facility, in order to reproduce a certain target wake. One of the main problems is to define this target wake, which should in principle coincide with the ship wake; as it is well known, it is usually derived from model scale towing tank measurements, with the necessity for the prediction of the full-scale wake field. Starting from the outcomes of a previous work on the influence of different approaches for the prediction of the full-scale wake field for a single screw ship, in this work, attention is focused on the case of a fast twin screw vessel, analysing the different issues which may be connected to this hull form.",

      "abstract": "Correct evaluation of rudder performance is a key issue in assessing ship maneuverability. This paper presents a simplified approach based on a viscous flow solver to address propeller and rudder interactions. Viscous flow solvers have been applied to this type of problems, but the large computational requests limit (or even prevent) their application at a preliminary ship design stage. Based on this idea, a simplified approach to include the propeller effect in front of the rudder is considered to speed up the solution. Based on the concept of body forces, this approach enables sufficiently fast computation for a preliminary ship design stage, thereby maintaining its reliability. To define the limitations of the proposed procedure, an extensive analysis of the simplified method is performed and the results are compared with experimental data presented in the literature. Initially, the reported results show the capability of the body-force approach to represent the inflow field to the rudder without the full description of the propeller, also with regard to the complex bollard pull condition. Consequently, the rudder forces are satisfactorily predicted at least with regard to the lift force. However, the drag force evaluation is more problematic and causes higher discrepancies. Nevertheless, these discrepancies may be accepted due to their lower influence on the overall ship maneuverability performance.",

      "abstract": "Experimental tests in model-scale are the currently established (and more reliable) methods for the propeller acoustic characterization. However, they are affected by uncertainties mostly due to scale effects, which make it difficult to consistently reproduce in model-scale some of full-scale functioning conditions. In order to cope with this issue, it is interesting to define empirical formulations to shape the most significant cavitating phenomena in terms of underwater radiated noise spectrum. A suitable approach for the determination of such formulations may consist in the experimental characterization of model propellers collecting a large amount of data such to accurately describe propeller functioning conditions and related noise emissions. Collected data should be then analysed to extrapolate desired formulations exploiting advanced data analysis techniques. In the present work the acoustical characterization of two propellers, performed at the University of Genoa cavitation tunnel, is presented. The collected sample includes cavitation buckets with inception points of different phenomena, noise spectra, pressure pulses and photos picked up at various pitches and functioning points, including off design conditions.",

Ship self-propulsion performance prediction represents one of the most interesting problems in this framework. The capabilities of CFD codes to resolve accurately the separate problems (open water propeller performance and hull resistance) have been demonstrated over the last decades. The complexity of the combined problem (and, in turn, the required computational time) has restricted its solution to research applications still far from everyday industrial practice. Some approaches have been developed to reduce the computational burden, based e.g. on simple actuator-disk theory or, recently, on BEM/RANS coupled solvers. In this respect, different approaches exploiting the open-source solver Open-FOAM are presented, focusing on the main self-propulsion parameters. In addition, a new numerical strategy able to provide more information compared to classical simplified approaches, is herein presented and validated against experimental measurements on the well-known Kriso Container Ship (KCS) test case.",

      "abstract": "The recent concern about the impact of underwater noise emitted by ships, pushed national and international bodies to face the problem of setting limits to ship noise emission. In order to set new limits, a deep knowledge of the three elements of the noise chain (i.e. source, transmission path and receiver) is needed. In this context it is therefore important to measure the acoustic signature of a ship, in order to characterize it as noise source. To this aim, dedicated measurements may be carried out during sea trials, which usually takes place in an area close to the building shipyard. The measurement layout foresees a series of hydrophones deployed in the water column placed at a distance of a hundred metres from the ship that passes abeam the hydrophones on a straight course. Such far field measurements are to be referred to the reference distance of 1 metre in order to ensure results comparability. Sound propagation from the ship to the hydrophones is therefore to be carefully taken into account also considering the fact that measurements are carried out in a continuously changing environment. In the present paper, an experimental technique to characterise the environment frequency response function is presented together with results of its onsite application.",

      "abstract": "Marine propellers design requirements are always more pressing and the application of unusual propulsive configurations, like ducted propellers with decelerating nozzles, may represent a valuable alternative to fulfill stringent design constraints. Accelerating duct configurations were realized mainly to increase the propeller efficiency in the case of highly-loaded functioning. The use of decelerating nozzles sustains the postponing of the cavitating phenomena that, in turn, reflects into a reduction of vibrations and radiated noise. The design of decelerating nozzle, unfortunately, is still challenging. The complex interaction between the propeller and the nozzle, both in terms of global flow feature and local (tip located) phenomena, is not yet fully understood. No extensive systematic series, as in the case of accelerating configurations, are available and the design still relies on few measurements and data. On the other hand, viscous flow solvers appear as reliable and accurate tools for the prediction of complex flow fields and their application for the calculation of ducted propeller performance and nozzle flow was almost successful. Hence, using CFD as a part of a design procedure based on optimization, by combining a parametric description of the geometry, a RANSE solver (OpenFOAM) and a genetic type algorithm (the modeFrontier optimization environment), is the obvious step towards an even more reliable ducted propeller design. An actuator disk model is adopted to include efficiently the influence of the propeller on the flow around the duct; this allows avoiding the weighting of the computational effort that is necessary for the calculations of the thousands of geometries needed for the indirect design by optimization. Design improvements, in model scale, are measured by comparing, by means of dedicated fully resolved RANSE calculations, the performance of the optimized geometries with those of conventional shapes available in literature. For both nozzle typologies, dedicated shapes reducing the risk of cavitation and increasing the delivered thrust are obtained, showing the opportunity of customized nozzle design out of usual systematic series. In addition, by analyzing the results of the optimization histories, appropriate design criteria are derived for both accelerating and decelerating nozzle shapes.",

      "abstract": "A growing attention has been recently devoted to the impact of the underwater noise field generated by shipping activities on the marine fauna. A key aspect for the quantification of such impact is a proper model of the source levels radiated from the vessels. At a first level of approximation, simplified formulations based on a small number of macroparameters describing the ship characteristics are needed to quantify the emission and, accordingly, assess the noise impact and evaluate strategies for its control. In fact, a few models of this kind are available in the literature, mainly based on measurements and databases developed for military purposes. Most of these models have been tuned on old ships: this poses the question whether they are still applicable to modern commercial vessels. In this work, spectra of a series of measurements of underwater noise emitted by commercial vessels measured in the framework of two EU FP7 projects (SILENV: www.silenv.eu and AQUO: www.aquo.eu) are analyzed and compared with the results obtained applying the available literature models. The analysis is carried out for noise emitted both at design and off-design conditions. In such conditions, the models are also compared with a proposed spectral parametrization. Focusing on the off-design conditions, a detailed narrow band analysis of a complete set of noise spectra is presented for a ship equipped with a controllable pitch propeller (CPP). The spectral peculiarities of such a propulsion plant, when operated at constant revolutions per minute (RPM) are highlighted. Results of the suggested parametrization applied to the same ship are presented together with the data of other CPP ships and a critical analysis is carried out discussing the limits of the existing predictive models.",

      "abstract": "The design of a propeller for a high-speed craft is addressed by using a multi-objective numerical optimization approach. By combining a fast and reliable Boundary Elements Method (BEM), a viscous flow solver based on the RANSE approximation, a parametric 3D description of the blade and a genetic algorithm, the new propeller shape is designed to improve the propulsive efficiency, reduce the cavitation extension, increase the cavitation inception speed and maximize, at the same time, the ship speed. Rather than by constraining the propeller delivered thrust, indeed, the proposed procedure works together with an engine-propeller matching algorithm that, each time a new propeller is defined, identifies the achievable maximum ship speed and the resulting engine functioning point that turn in additional goals for the multi-objective optimization. A set of optimal propellers, obtained through the design by optimization based on potential flow calculations (via the Boundary Elements Method), are selected for additional viscous analyses (RANSE calculations) in order to further validate the results of the BEM calculations and provide a deeper insight into the complex flow fields of high speed propellers. Among this subset of optimal configurations, a final geometry is selected to verify the reliability of the design procedure by means of dedicated cavitation tunnel tests and full-scale measurements on a high-speed craft provided by Azimut|Benetti.",

      "abstract": "The increase in marine transportation in the last decades has resulted in a rise of the different emissions linked to it. Amongst various detrimental emissions of shipping activities, underwater noise is known to affect ambient noise levels and hence threaten the life (or even survivability) of marine mammals. This concern brought the underwater radiated noise (URN) to the attention of regulators, considering the possible need to limits for commercial ships, thus resulting in a surge of interest. As being the main contributor to the URN of ships, the accurate prediction of propeller cavitation and hence associated noise in the design stage is crucial for achieving reductions in terms of emitted sound pressure levels. Whilst computational methods are developing at an exponential pace and so are prospective tools for the future, model scale experiments still represent the most reliable and largely adopted approach for the prediction of propeller radiated noise. Despite the importance of model tests, being the only reliable tool for cavitation noise prediction, a benchmark data is non-existent for facilities all over the world to compare and correlate their noise measurements. Within this framework, this paper presents the first comparison of a round robin test campaign amongst the Noise CoP (Community of Practice) of Hydro Testing Forum (HTF). Based on the extensive experiments conducted first at Emerson Cavitation Tunnel (ECT), a reduced test matrix is proposed to the forum members. University of Genoa (UNIGE) is the first member to complete the tests specified in the reduced matrix and this paper presents comparisons between the test results of ECT and UNIGE cavitation tunnel in terms of measured sound pressure levels, propeller open water performance, cavitation observations and cavitation inception characteristics. Moreover, in order to shed a light on the issue of propeller cavitation noise measurements, a series of investigations are carried out by UNIGE scrutinizing the effect of hydrophone position, oxygen content, propeller shaft revolution rate, sensitivity to thrust coefficient and cavitation number.",

      "abstract": "The present paper is focused on an experimental investigation of pressure pulses and radiated noise for two alternative designs of a propeller of a high-speed craft. The propellers have been designed in the context of a research project starting from two different rake distributions (forward rake to increase thrust and efficiency, backward rake to reduce cavitation), using different techniques (traditional lifting line / lifting surface and optimization algorithm coupled with a panel code), leading thus to rather different geometries. Propellers have been tested through cavitation tunnel experiments. The activity represents an interesting case study for this kind of measurement in presence of rather large cavitation extensions. The effects of cavitation on different components of pressure pulses and noise are investigated for the different rake distributions adopted. Results clearly shows the effects of this geometrical characteristic on cavitation and pressure pulses pointing out that, in some cases, propeller hydrodynamic performances may determine pressure pulses intensity more than cavitation extensions. A simplified numerical approach, adopting stationary RANS calculations, for the evaluation of the effects of propeller geometry, has been proposed. Results show a good correlation with measurements allowing to have an insight into the phenomenon and confirming the effect of the rake.",

      "abstract": "The prediction of propeller induced pressure fluctuations and underwater radiated noise is a subject of great and increasing interest in marine engineering. Nevertheless, the full-scale prediction of these negative effects, even though based on dedicated model scale tests represents still a challenging task. This is due to different phenomena, among which scale effects on cavitation and ship wake, confined environment and near field effects in model tests play an important role; the analysis of these problems is made difficult by the rather limited amount of available data from sea trials and to the complexities of the phenomena, most of which related to cavitation on the propeller blades, that are present in the measurements carried out in cavitation tunnels, depressurized towing tanks or circulating channels. In the present work, the subject has been studied with reference to a four blades conventional CP propeller of a coastal tanker. Cavitation tunnel tests have been carried out in two rather different facilities, at UNIGE cavitation tunnel and at SSPA large cavitation tunnel. Results from model scale tests processed with different treatments are then compared with full scale measurements performed by SSPA on the same propeller in terms of cavitation extension and radiated noise. The analysis is aimed at assessing the effectiveness of different experimental setups, testing procedures and scaling laws.",

      "abstract": "The present paper deals with the side effects of propellers cavitation, i.e. pressure pulses and radiated noise. These effects are gaining more and more importance for commercial ships for different reasons. Pressure pulses significantly affect comfort onboard, thus their reduction is of utmost importance for all ships carrying passengers. As regards the underwater radiated noise, in the last decade interest has shifted from navy applications to commercial ships, due to the concern for the rising background noise in the oceans. The propellers, generating noise directly in water, represent one of the main contributions to the overall underwater noise emitted from ships. Due to the complexity of the mechanisms of propeller noise generation, different complementary strategies have to be followed to properly analyze the problem, ranging from induced pressure pulses to broadband noise and cavitation. In the present work, part of the activities carried out in the framework of the collaborative EU FP7 project AQUO (Achieve QUieter Oceans by shipping noise footprint reduction, www.aquo.eu) are reported. The paper presents the investigations carried out on a specific test case represented by a single screw research vessel, which is analyzed with three different strategies: numerical calculations, model scale investigations and full-scale measurements.",

      "abstract": "A statistical analysis of noise can play an important role in evaluating the performances of an acoustic system working underwater. If the system is either placed on board a vessel or operates nearby passing ships, the noise radiated by the vessel can considerably reduce the performances of the system if it has been not designed to have enough robustness. In the paper, a statistical analysis of ship noise records measured at sea is presented. Noise data were recorded in the framework of the EU FP7 European project AQUO (Achieve QUieter Oceans by shipping noise footprint reduction). Aim of the analysis is to characterize the ship noise in terms of probability distributions and their high-order moments. Since the overall ship noise is known to be generated by a number of sources with peculiar spectral energy distributions, the vessel spectrum can change considerably with a variation in the operating conditions. This approach allows determining the dependence of ship noise statistical properties on the actual navigation condition. In addition, since the ship noise records were simultaneously recorded by a vertical array of three hydrophones, a further analysis has been carried out to determine the effect of the receiver depth, and, accordingly, of the propagation path, in the recorded signal.",

      "abstract": "The continuous development of design tools and analysis procedures has allowed propeller performances to increase progressively during years following more and more stringent design requirements. High propeller efficiency and avoidance of erosive cavitation are considered nowadays basic requests for a well designed propeller. However this may not be enough to meet the requirements of high added value ships such as passengers ships, mega yachts, research vessels, naval vessels etc. These kinds of ship need a propulsion system not only with good efficiency but also with low levels of vibrations and noise transmitted inside the ship and with low underwater radiated noise. Moreover, the above mentioned ships often work in a rather wide range of operational condition. Actually, the possibility to operate at reduced speed regards almost all kinds of ships, due to the increasing attention to fuel consumption and exhaust gas emissions, and the related tendency towards slow steaming. Speed reduction may be obtained in different ways. In the case of ships equipped with CPPs, in principle it may be achieved reducing RPM at constant pitch or reducing pitch at constant RPM; the latter is usually preferred when a power take off is present. This results in working conditions far from design ones for the propeller; Cavitation and related radiated noise may increase significantly in similar situations, despite the speed reduction is felt to be generally beneficial for the purpose. In this work, the effect of different speed reduction strategies on cavitation and radiated noise is studied by means of cavitation tunnel tests of four CPPs including both single screw and twin screw configurations.",

      "abstract": "The problem of the tip vortex cavitation inception is a matter of increasing interest. Main reason for this is that, despite being, generally, not erosive and not influent on the propeller mechanical characteristics, the cavitating vortex dynamics may play a significant role in the propeller radiated noise. In the present work, a thorough analysis of the capability of a commercial RANS solver in conjunction with the Schnerr-Sauer cavitation model to predict the tip and the tip leakage vortex cavitation (with particular attention to their inception) for a conventional and two ducted propellers respectively, is presented. Considering at first a conventional CP propeller, a comprehensive analysis of the effect of the various parameters (e.g. mesh characteristics, number and size of nuclei in the numerical calculations) on the computed results is reported, together with a comparison with the experimental measurements carried out in a cavitation tunnel. This analysis allows to stress the capabilities of RANS computations to correctly predict tip phenomena and to provide guidelines in order to obtain reliable numerical results, having in mind the necessity of a compromise between calculation accuracy and computational time, essential in the case of a systematic application of the presented approach for design purposes. Furthermore the calculations are repeated also for two propellers in decelerating duct and the satisfactory results obtained demonstrate the capability of the proposed approach to correctly rank two slightly different geometries also for this more complex and challenging case.",

      "abstract": "The propeller performances and in particular the non-stationary cavitating behavior and its side effects, i.e. pressure pulses and radiated noise, are strongly dependent on the ship wake field. Many different predictive methods are available, however in many cases predictions are still performed on the basis of semi-empirical approaches, whose validity is doubtful. In parallel to this, the ever increasing power of computational tools (namely RANS solvers) allows for a direct numerical prediction of the ship full scale wake. In the present paper, the effect of the adoption of two different full scale wakes obtained with semi-empirical methods and direct computations is evaluated experimentally by means of cavitation turmel tests on a model propeller, focusing the attention not only on mechanical characteristics and cavitation extents but, specifically, on pressure pulses and radiated noise. The results of this study put into evidence the differences which may be expected using the two different scaling approaches.",

Such a testing facility makes possible the fluodynamic and acoustic characterization of in scale models of naval propellers. To get significant data it is mandatory for the acquisitions that the test facility operates in optimal conditions, limiting as much as possible any type of emission of noise not associated to the propeller under test. Recently, noise originating from the driveline requested an investigation on its causes to locate the elements constituting its source. To identify and to characterize the failure, both microphonic and accelerometric measurements were performed. With reference to the first typology of measurements, an acoustic mapping in three dimensions was adopted, making possible to locate the mostly critical driveline zones and to individuate the possible components having an anomalous operation present in the driveline. In addition, in the same time accelerometric measurements have been done to acquire structural information on the driveline itself. The correlation between the vibrational data and the acoustic ones made possible to obtain additional elements useful to complete the diagnostic study on the system.",

In the present paper, a hybrid design approach, adopting a coupled lifting line/panel method solver and a successive refinement with panel solver and optimization techniques, is presented. In order to validate this procedure and provide information about these propulsors, experimental results at towing tank and cavitation tunnel are compared with numerical predictions. Moreover, additional results obtained by means of a commercial RANS solver, not directly adopted in the design loop, are also presented, allowing to stress the relative merits and shortcomings of the different numerical approaches. © 2012 Stefano Gaggero et al.",
