      "abstract": "Autonomous agents can perceive and act in the environment only by interacting with neighboring agents. This paper proposes a novel probabilistic interaction model that allows the agent to learn the dynamics of the interactive experiences incrementally. The learned model represents the dynamic interaction variables within a joint Generalized State (GS) space. This allows to represent the contextual information of the agent's experiences in the form of time-varying probabilistic graphical models whose variables are geometrically interpreted as attractors. Such a generative model is defined as Interactive Hierarchical Generalized Dynamic Bayesian Network (IH-GDBN). Various interaction models describing the agents’ experiences are collectively stored as bio-inspired memory layers of the agent's Autobiographical Memory (AM). Knowledge stored inside AM is accessed by the Bayesian inference method called Interactive Geometrical Markov Jump Particle Filter (IG-MJPF) and is able to make inferences of future interaction states based on learned IH-GDBNs. Moreover, such filters are enriched to detect anomalies as effects of unknown geometrical forces, i.e., deviating from the predictions of a model called as Generalized Errors (GEs). The estimation of GEs allows the agent to learn the new models incrementally by evolving the respective layers of AM to adapt the changing interaction situations. The proposed method is tested in real-time, complex overtaking experiments involving two Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). Future work will extend these experiments to scenarios with more than two vehicles to better reflect multi-agent traffic dynamics. Two different sensory modalities are employed to show, how the AM memory layers can be learned from the exteroceptive, i.e., positional trajectories (called odometry module) and proprioceptive sensors, i.e. steering angle and rotors’ velocity. Performance of the proposed method highlights the detection capabilities as well as the ability to learn explainable incremental successive models within the AM.

      "abstract": "This paper proposes a method to perform Visual-Based Localization within an explainable self-awareness framework, by combining deep learning with traditional signal processing methods. Localization, along with anomaly detection, is an important challenge in video surveillance and fault detection. Let us consider, for example, the case of a vehicle patrolling a train station: it must continuously know its location to effectively monitor the surroundings and respond to potential threats. In the proposed method, a Dynamic Bayesian Network model is learned. A vocabulary of clusters is obtained using the odometry and video data, and is employed to guide the training of the video model. As the video model, a combination of a Variational Autoencoder and a Kalman Filter is adopted. In the online phase, a Coupled Markov Jump Particle Filter is proposed for Visual-Based Localization. This filter combines a set of Kalman Filters with a Particle Filter, allowing us to extract possible anomalies in the test scenario as well. The proposed method is integrated into a framework based on awareness theories, and is data-driven, hierarchical, probabilistic, and explainable. The method is evaluated on trajectories from four real-world datasets, i.e., two terrestrial and two aerial. The localization accuracy and explainability of the method are analyzed in detail. We achieve a mean localization accuracy in meters of 1.65, 0.98, 0.23, and 0.87, on the four datasets.",

      "abstract": "The development of efficient and reliable trajectory-planning strategies for swarms of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is an increasingly important area of research, with applications in surveillance, search and rescue, smart agriculture, defence operations, and communication networks. This article provides a comprehensive and critical review of the various techniques available for UAV swarm trajectory planning, which can be broadly categorised into three main groups: traditional algorithms, biologically inspired metaheuristics, and modern artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods. The study examines cutting-edge research, comparing key aspects of trajectory planning, including computational efficiency, scalability, inter-UAV coordination, energy consumption, and robustness in uncertain environments. The strengths and weaknesses of these algorithms are discussed in detail, particularly in the context of collision avoidance, adaptive decision making, and the balance between centralised and decentralised control. Additionally, the review highlights hybrid frameworks that combine the global optimisation power of bio-inspired algorithms with the real-time adaptability of AI-based approaches, aiming to achieve an effective exploration–exploitation trade-off in multi-agent environments. Lastly, the article addresses the major challenges in UAV swarm trajectory planning, including multidimensional trajectory spaces, nonlinear dynamics, and real-time adaptation. It also identifies promising directions for future research. This study serves as a valuable resource for researchers, engineers, and system designers working to develop UAV swarms for real-world, integrated, intelligent, and autonomous missions.",

Our methodology leverages generative models, specifically Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs), interaction dictionaries, and a Markov Jump Particle Filter (MJPF), to accurately classify objects within LiDAR point clouds and localize the ego vehicle without relying on external odometry data during testing. The classification phase effectively distinguishes between static and dynamic objects with high accuracy, achieving an F1 score of 91%. The localization phase utilizes a combined dictionary approach, integrating multiple static landmarks to improve robustness, particularly during simultaneous multi-track observations and no-observation intervals. Experimental results validate the efficacy of our proposed approach in enhancing localization accuracy and maintaining consistency in diverse scenarios",

      "abstract": "Learning from experience is a fundamental capability of intelligent agents. Autonomous systems rely on sensors that provide data about the environment and internal situations to their perception systems for learning and inference mechanisms. These systems can also learn Self-Aware and Situation-Aware generative modules from these data to localize themselves and interact with the environment. In this paper, we propose a self-aware cognitive architecture capable to perform tasks where the interactions between the self-state of an agent and the surrounding environment are explicitly and dynamically represented. We specifically develop a Deep Learning (DL) based Self-Aware interaction model, empowered by learning from Multi-Modal Perception (MMP) and World Models using multi-sensory data in a novel Multi-Agent Self-Awareness Architecture (MASAA). Two sub-modules are developed, the Situation Model (SM) and the First-Person model (FPM), that address different and interrelated aspects of the World Model (WM). The MMP model, instead, aims at learning the mapping of different sensory perceptions into Exteroceptive (EI) and Proprioceptive (PI) latent information. The WM then uses the learned MMP model as experience to predict dynamic self-behaviors and interaction patterns within the experienced environment. WM and MMP Models are learned in a data-driven way, starting from the lower-dimensional odometry data used to guide the learning of higher-dimensional video data, thus generating coupled Generalized State Hierarchical Dynamic Bayesian Networks (GS-HDBNs). We test our model on KITTI, CARLA, and iCab datasets, achieving high performance and a low average localization error (RMSE) of 2.897%, when considering two interacting agents.",

      "abstract": "The integration of autonomous aerial vehicles (AAVs), cognitive radio (CR), and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) presents a promising solution to significantly enhance the performance of future wireless networks. Achieving this integration requires cognitive self-awareness for intelligent resource allocation. In this paper, we address the problem of sum rate maximization in AAV-enabled cognitive NOMA uplink systems through the joint optimization of subchannel assignment and power allocation, while considering the AAV’s mobility. The traditional approach to finding the optimal solution requires an iterative or exhaustive search across all possible combinations of subchannel assignment, power allocation, and AAV position at each time slot, leading to excessive computational complexity. Furthermore, machine learning models, often trained on datasets that do not fully capture the complexity of real-world scenarios, struggle to handle non-stationary events effectively. To solve this nonconvex optimization challenge, we draw inspiration from active inference in cognitive neuroscience and propose a novel data-driven approach called the Active Generalized Dynamic Bayesian Network (Active-GDBN). The main idea is to process the unknown nonlinear input of an exhaustive search optimization algorithm using an Active-GDBN framework. This framework leverages a probabilistic generative model to learn the complex relationships and dependencies among subchannel assignments, power distributions, and the AAV’s mobility. The model is facilitated by continuous neuronal message passing in both discrete and continuous states to predict the optimal configuration. Numerical results show that the proposed approach achieves sum rate performance near the optimal exhaustive search and surpasses other baseline approaches.",

Drone positional information is crucial in indoor surveillance applications. So, to address this issue, this paper proposes a method for drone localization that uses onboard sensors (camera and IMUs) and ArUco markers placed in the environment. The positions estimated from Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) are combined with the ones from marker detection through a Kalman Filter (KF). Then, an external fixed Lidar sensor is employed to track the drone. This latter localization serves as a ground-truth for the former one, and for possible successive elaborations of the positional data. The two estimations are aligned and synchronized. The methodology is evaluated using a DJI FLY 2S drone and an Ouster OS1 Lidar in a closed environment.",

      "abstract": "Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms are increasingly recognized for their versatility and affordability. These swarms have enhanced various applications, including agriculture, surveillance, delivery services, and monitoring. However, fully utilizing the capabilities of UAV swarms requires addressing challenges related to trajectory design, particularly the Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem (MTSP). It involves optimizing the paths of multiple UAVs while avoiding collisions, minimizing overlap and interference, and managing the overall size of the swarm. These challenges highlight the complexities involved in developing high-performance, organized UAV swarm operations. We propose a novel approach based on repulsion force in UAV swarm trajectory design to tackle these issues. Our method utilizes a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to generate a dynamic Repulsion Force (RF) that optimizes the distance between UAVs and the size of the swarm. This approach reduces interference and overlap while effectively navigating the limitations posed by the MTSP. Our proposed solution aims to design efficient trajectories that enhance the overall performance of UAV swarms. We compared our proposed method to existing algorithms, including the MTSPGA, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), 2-OPT, Ant Colony (AC) Optimization, and Simulated Annealing (SA), using simulations and evaluations. The results indicate that our proposed method effectively optimizes travel distances and times, reduces interference levels and overlapping, prevents collisions between UAVs, and enhances the size of the UAV swarm. Overall, our method outperforms current approaches, demonstrating its effectiveness for UAV-based applications.",

This paper explores using a UAV as an autonomous agent, navigating over multiple hotspots to serve ground users (GUs) and maximize data transmission rates through strategic trajectory design. Existing interpretability methods often prove insufficient in providing comprehensive insights and generating logical, sequential decisions. In this paper, we propose an explainable reinforcement learning framework designed to produce interpretable and verifiable agent policies. Our method starts with an expert optimizer to solve training examples, enabling the learning agent (UAV) to analyse the solutions. Furthermore, we employ inverse reinforcement learning for data-driven reward function estimation. Additionally, we use a probabilistic Qtable function to understand and explain the actions executed by the expert across diverse environmental contexts, allowing the learning agent to produce interpretable policies that meet reasonable performance goals and easily transferred to unseen environments. Preliminary results indicate that the proposed approach is promising in achieving explainability in RL agents.",

      "abstract": "Being able to robustly interact with and navigate a dynamic environment has been a long-standing challenge in intelligent transportation systems. Autonomous agents can use models that mimic the human brain to learn how to respond to other participants’ actions in the environment and proactively coordinate with the dynamics. Modeling brain learning procedures is challenging for multiple reasons, such as stochasticity, multimodality, and unobservant intents. Active inference may be defined as the Bayesian modeling of a brain with a biologically plausible model of the agent. Its primary idea relies on the free energy principle and the prior preference of the agent. It enables the agent to choose an action that leads to its preferred future observations. An exploring action-oriented model is introduced to address the inference complexity and solve the exploration–exploitation dilemma in unobserved environments. It is conducted by adapting active inference to an imitation learning approach and finding a theoretical connection between them. We present a multimodal self-awareness architecture for autonomous driving systems where the proposed techniques are evaluated on their ability to model proper driving behavior. Experimental results provide the basis for the intelligent driving system to make more human-like decisions and improve agent performance to avoid a collision.",

      "abstract": "Equipping autonomous agents for dynamic interaction and navigation is a significant challenge in intelligent transportation systems. This study aims to address this by implementing a brain-inspired model for decision making in autonomous vehicles. We employ active inference, a Bayesian approach that models decision-making processes similar to the human brain, focusing on the agent’s preferences and the principle of free energy. This approach is combined with imitation learning to enhance the vehicle’s ability to adapt to new observations and make human-like decisions. The research involved developing a multi-modal self-awareness architecture for autonomous driving systems and testing this model in driving scenarios, including abnormal observations. The results demonstrated the model’s effectiveness in enabling the vehicle to make safe decisions, particularly in unobserved or dynamic environments. The study concludes that the integration of active inference with imitation learning significantly improves the performance of autonomous vehicles, offering a promising direction for future developments in intelligent transportation systems.",

In this paper, a method is presented for classifying static and dynamic tracks in autonomous vehicles using odometry and LiDAR data. Using the multi-target tracking algorithm, we are able to detect and track objects with high precision. We used an unsupervised clustering algorithm to create innovative interaction models, which will be employed for vehicle localization in the future. Because clustering is based upon time and spatial proximity, we are able to create interaction models using dynamic bayesian networks (DBNs) that allow us to classify and differentiate static from dynamic tracks. Based on our method, we achieve an accuracy of 87% in distinguishing between static and dynamic obstacles, thereby enhancing navigation by identifying and differentiating different types of obstacles efficiently.",

First, we propose an adaptive Bayesian filtering technique based on a combination of Null force hypothesis and Particle filtering to accurately track the trajectories of normal and abnormal cases. We then analyze the generalized vectors and clusters generated from adaptive filtering and sequential clustering procedures to effectively detect areas with high abnormalities. To achieve this, we use probabilistic distance measurements. Finally, to increase the agent's vocabulary, we fuse different anomaly distributions to generate coupled anomaly models that allow the agent to have incremental learning capabilities. Our approach is completely data-driven and does not require any previous knowledge of the data or the environment. We show that our proposed method can effectively detect anomalies using low-dimensional odometry data and can eventually improve itself over time through iterative generation of fused anomaly models.",

      "abstract": "Intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) provide a paradigm change in perceiving and interacting with transportation networks, leading to enhanced levels of safety, sustainability, and efficiency. Vehicular-to-everything (V2X) communication is the core component in the ITSs. The proprioceptive and exteroceptive sensors allow these vehicles to be aware of the surrounding environment and respond to emergencies by utilizing their abilities to reach a high level of self-awareness. In this paper, we propose a self-awareness approach to learn a generative dynamic Bayesian network (G-DBN) from the real-time LiDAR perception. Without reducing the dimensionality, we perform offline training and online testing phases on the three-dimensional (3D) point clouds. In the offline training phase, initially, the raw point clouds are preprocessed using a joint probabilistic data association filter (JPDAF) to obtain the 3D tracks of the multiple vehicles in space. Then, we perform an unsupervised clustering on all the generalized states (GSs) containing positions and velocities (a 6D vector) by considering the growing neural gas (GNG) technique, thus achieving a trained model from the 3D LiDAR point clouds. In the online testing phase, the high-dimensional Markov jump particle filter (HD-MJPF) utilizes the G-DBN's probabilistic information to predict the positions of multiple vehicles and to detect the abnormalities at the discrete and continuous levels in normal and abnormal scenarios. Our proposed approach is useful for learning high-dimensional generative models and provides a way to meet the current curse of dimensionality challenges, that machine learning models are suffering.",

      "abstract": "Generalizability and interpretability are common terminologies that can be found in today's machine learning algorithm design. Generalizability requires a clear understanding of one's own action (self-awareness) and a robust interaction with the environment (situation awareness). Many current studies are devoted in developing an algorithm that is more robust in generalizing unseen situations while explaining self-action. However, such algorithms are complex and are not yet fully developed to be used in production. Intelligent transportation systems like self-driving cars are one of the emerging technologies that need generalizability and explainability in anomalous conditions. We propose to enhance generalizability and interpretability of a self-driving car model by introducing a novel methodology that fuses multi-sensorial data from proprioceptive and exteroceptive sensors of an agent, coupled in a Hierarchical Dynamic Bayesian Network model, in an Active Inference framework. The developed model has three stages: 1) a lower dimensional unsupervised learning stage, considering odometry and action modalities, carried out by first applying Null Force Filtering and then by applying modified GNG clustering algorithms; 2) a self-supervised higher-dimensional video modality learning stage assisted by the learned odometry vocabularies; and 3) an online model-based active learning in continuous and discrete state spaces, and action spaces, in the Active Inference framework. The developed system is tested using the CARLA simulator environment for localizing interacting agents, and exhibits low error compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a novel self-supervised path-planning method for UAV-aided networks. First, we employed an optimizer to solve training examples offline and then used the resulting solutions as demonstrations from which the UAV can learn the world model to understand the environment and implicitly discover the optimizer’s policy. UAV equipped with the world model can make real-time autonomous decisions and engage in online planning using active inference. During planning, UAV can score different policies based on the expected surprise, allowing it to choose among alternative futures. Additionally, UAV can anticipate the outcomes of its actions using the world model and assess the expected surprise in a self-supervised manner. Our method enables quicker adaptation to new situations and better performance than traditional RL, leading to broader generalizability.",

      "abstract": "Deploying unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as aerial base stations is an exceptional approach to reinforce terrestrial infrastructure owing to their remarkable flexibility and superior agility. However, it is essential to design their flight trajectory effectively to make the most of UAV-assisted wireless communications. This paper presents a novel method for improving wireless connectivity between UAVs and terrestrial users through effective path planning. This is achieved by developing a goal-directed trajectory planning method using active inference. First, we create a global dictionary using traveling salesman problem with profits (TSPWP) instances executed on various training examples. This dictionary represents the world model and contains letters representing available hotspots, tokens representing local paths, and words depicting complete trajectories and hotspot order. By using this world model, the UAV can understand the TSPWP’s decision-making grammar and how to use the available letters to form tokens and words at various levels of abstraction and time scales. With this knowledge, the UAV can assess encountered situations and deduce optimal routes based on the belief encoded in the world model. Our proposed method outperforms traditional Q-learning by providing fast, stable, and reliable solutions with good generalization ability.",

      "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on advanced sensory systems, such as Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), to function seamlessly in intricate and dynamic environments. LiDAR produces highly accurate 3D point clouds, which are vital for the detection, classification, and tracking of multiple targets. A systematic review and classification of various clustering and Multi-Target Tracking (MTT) techniques are necessary due to the inherent challenges posed by LiDAR data, such as density, noise, and varying sampling rates. As part of this study, the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology was employed to examine the challenges and advancements in MTT techniques and clustering for LiDAR point clouds within the context of autonomous driving. Searches were conducted in major databases such as IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, ACM Digital Library, and Google Scholar, utilizing customized search strategies. We identified and critically reviewed 76 relevant studies based on rigorous screening and evaluation processes, assessing their methodological quality, data handling adequacy, and reporting compliance. As a result of this comprehensive review and classification, we were able to provide a detailed overview of current challenges, research gaps, and advancements in clustering and MTT techniques for LiDAR point clouds, thus contributing to the field of autonomous driving. Researchers and practitioners working in the field of autonomous driving will benefit from this study, which was characterized by transparency and reproducibility on a systematic basis.",

      "abstract": "Given the surge in wireless data traffic driven by the emerging Internet of Things (IoT), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), cognitive radio (CR), and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) have been recognized as promising techniques to overcome massive connectivity issues. As a result, there is an increasing need to intelligently improve the channel capacity of future wireless networks. Motivated by active inference from cognitive neuroscience, this paper investigates joint subchannel and power allocation for an uplink UAV-assisted cognitive NOMA network. Maximizing the sum rate is often a highly challenging optimization problem due to dynamic network conditions and power constraints. To address this challenge, we propose an active inference-based algorithm. We transform the sum rate maximization problem into abnormality minimization by utilizing a generalized state-space model to characterize the time-changing network environment. The problem is then solved using an Active Generalized Dynamic Bayesian Network (Active-GDBN). The proposed framework consists of an offline perception stage, in which a UAV employs a hierarchical GDBN structure to learn an optimal generative model of discrete sub channels and continuous power allocation. In the online active inference stage, the UAV dynamically selects discrete sub channels and continuous power to maximize the sum rate of secondary users. By leveraging the errors in each episode, the UAV can adapt its resource allocation policies and belief updating to improve its performance over time. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in terms of cumulative sum rate compared to benchmark schemes.",

      "abstract": "Future wireless networks will need to improve adaptive resource allocation and decision-making to handle the increasing number of intelligent devices. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are being explored for their potential in real-time decision-making. Moreover, cognitive non-orthogonal multiple access (Cognitive-NOMA) is envisioned as a remedy to address spectrum scarcity and enable massive connectivity. This paper investigates the design of joint subchannel and power allocation in an uplink UAV-based cognitive NOMA network. We aim to maximize the cumulative sum rate by jointly optimizing the subchannel and power allocation based on the UAV's mobility at each time step. This is often formulated as an optimization problem with random variables. However, conventional optimization algorithms normally introduce significant complexity, and machine learning methods often rely on large but partially representative datasets to build solution models, assuming stationary testing data. Consequently, inference strategies for non stationary events are often overlooked. In this study, we introduce a novel active inference-based learning approach, rooted in cognitive neuroscience, to solve this complex problem. The framework involves creating a training dataset using random or iterative methods to find suboptimal resource allocations. This dataset trains a mobile UAV offline, enabling it to learn a generative model of discrete subchannels and continuous power allocation. The UAV then uses this model for online inference. The method incrementally derives new generative models from training data by identifying dynamic equilibrium conditions between required actions and variables, represented within a unique dynamic Bayesian network. The proposed approach is validated through numerical simulations, showing efficient performance compared to suboptimal baseline schemes.",

      "abstract": "Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication is expected to be a prominent component of the sixth generation (6G) to accomplish intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Autonomous vehicles relying only on onboard sensors cannot bypass the limitations of safety and reliability. Thus, integrated sensing and communication is proposed as an effective way to achieve high situational- and self-awareness levels, enabling V2X to perceive the physical world and adjust its behaviour to emergencies. Secure navigation through the Global Positioning System (GPS) is essential in ITS for safe operation. Nevertheless, due to the lack of encryption and authentication mechanisms of civil GPS receivers, spoofers can easily replicate satellite signals by launching GPS spoofing attacks to deceive the vehicle and manipulate navigation data. In addition, due to its shared nature, V2X links are prone to jamming attacks which might endanger vehicular safety. This paper proposes a method to jointly detect GPS spoofing and jamming attacks in a V2X network. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can detect spoofers and jammers with high detection probabilities.",

      "abstract": "The combination of different sensory information to predict upcoming situations is an innate capability of intelligent beings. Consequently, various studies in the Artificial Intelligence field are currently being conducted to transfer this ability to artificial systems. Autonomous vehicles can particularly benefit from the combination of multi-modal information from the different sensors of the agent. This paper proposes a method for video-frame prediction that leverages odometric data. It can then serve as a basis for anomaly detection. A Dynamic Bayesian Network framework is adopted, combined with the use of Deep Learning methods to learn an appropriate latent space. First, a Markov Jump Particle Filter is built over the odometric data. This odometry model comprises a set of clusters. As a second step, the video model is learned. It is composed of a Kalman Variational Autoencoder modified to leverage the odometry clusters for focusing its learning attention on features related to the dynamic tasks that the vehicle is performing. We call the obtained overall model Cluster-Guided Kalman Variational Autoencoder. Evaluation is conducted using data from a car moving in a closed environment and leveraging a part of the University of Alcalá DriveSet dataset, where several drivers move in a normal and drowsy way along a secondary road.",

The model is grounded in a principled framework to learn and cognize the dynamic surrounding of a learning agent, which exemplifies the model’s functioning by presenting a simulation of overtaking scenarios in autonomous driving. The learning agent integrates imitation learning and active inference to form hierarchical representations from expert demonstrations. During the online learning phase, the learning agent improves the action selection procedure based on the prior knowledge (exploiting) and the novel interactions with a dynamic environment (exploring). The proposed method applies an active knowledge sampling during the learning agent’s movements to make a dynamic inference in the Bayesian structure by message passing through the multi-levels. A line-changing driving scenario with different levels of complexity is organized to verify the proposed framework’s efficiency by dealing with single and multiple dynamic objects interacting in the environment.",

      "abstract": "The integration of Cognitive Radio (CR) with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is an effective step towards relieving the spectrum scarcity and empowering the UAV with a high degree of intelligence. The dynamic nature of CR and the dominant line-of-sight links of UAVs poses serious security challenges and make the CR-UAV prone to a variety of attacks as malicious jamming. Joint jammer detection and automatic jammer classification is a powerful approach against the physical layer threats by identifying multiple jammers attacking the network that realize a crucial stage towards efficient interference management. This paper proposes a novel method for joint detection and automatic classification of multiple jammers attacking with different modulation schemes. The method is based on learning a representation of the radio environment encoded in a Generalized Dynamic Bayesian Network (GDBN) whilst multiple GDBN models represent various jamming signals under different modulation schemes. The CR-UAV performs multiple predictions online in parallel and evaluates multiple abnormality measurements based on a Modified Markov Jump Particle Filter (M-MJPF) to select the best-fit model that explains the detected jammer and recognize the modulation scheme accordingly. The simulated results demonstrate that the proposed GDBN-based method outperforms Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Stacked Autoencoder (SAE) in terms of classification accuracy and achieves a higher degree of explainability of its own decisions by interpreting causes and effects at hierarchical levels under the Bayesian learning and reasoning processes.",

      "abstract": "This work proposes a novel resource allocation strategy for anti-jamming in Cognitive Radio using Active Inference (AIn), and a cognitive-UAV is employed as a case study. An Active Generalized Dynamic Bayesian Network (Active-GDBN) is proposed to represent the external environment that jointly encodes the physical signal dynamics and the dynamic interaction between UAV and jammer in the spectrum. We cast the action and planning as a Bayesian inference problem that can be solved by avoiding surprising states (minimizing abnormality) during online learning. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed AIn approach in minimizing abnormalities (maximizing rewards) and has a high convergence speed by comparing it with the conventional Frequency Hopping and Q-learning.",

LiDAR is assumed to be an exteroceptive sensor that allows the vehicle to have dynamic 3D scene perception of its surroundings. We employ an encoder-decoder architecture based on 3D-Convolutional layers called 3D Convolution Encoder-Decoder (3D-CED), together with a transfer learning strategy to extract a set of features from point clouds, which are relevant in the context of autonomous driving. The resulting features allow to make inferences of the future point cloud data and detect multiple abstraction level anomalies in controlled scenarios by utilizing a probabilistic switching dynamic model called High Dimensional Markov Jump Particle Filter (HD-MJPF). Moreover, a comparison is provided between piecewise linear, piecewise nonlinear, and nonlinear predictive models for anomaly detection at multiple abstraction levels. Our approach is evaluated with data collected from the LiDAR sensors of the autonomous vehicle while performing certain tasks in a controlled environment.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose to introduce an emergent Self-Awareness (SA) module at the physical layer (PHY) in Cognitive Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Radios to improve PHY security, especially against jamming attacks. SA is based on learning a hierarchical representation of the radio environment by means of a proposed Hierarchical Dynamic Bayesian Network (HDBN). It is shown how the acquired knowledge from previous experiences facilitate the radio spectrum perception and allow the radio to detect abnormal behaviours caused by jamming attacks. Detecting abnormalities realize a fundamental step towards growing up incrementally the radio's long-term memory. Deviations from predictions estimated during abnormal situations are used to characterize jammers at multiple levels and discover their dynamic behavioural rules. Besides, a proactive consequence can be drawn after estimating the jammer's signal to act efficiently by mitigating its effects on the received stimuli. Simulation results show that the introduction of the novel SA functionalities with the proposed HDBN framework provides the high accuracy of characterizing, detecting and predicting the jammer's activities.",

      "abstract": "Every person spends around one third of his/her life in bed. For an infant or a young toddler, this percentage can be much higher, and for bed-bound patients it can go up to 100% of their time. In-bed pose estimation is a critical step in many human behavior monitoring systems that are focused on prevention, prediction, and management of at-rest or sleep-related conditions in both adults and children. The topic of automatic noncontact human pose estimation has received a lot of attention/success, especially in the last few years in the computer vision community, thanks to the introduction of deep learning and its power in artificial intelligence (AI) modeling. However, the state-of-the-art (SOTA) vision-based AI algorithms in this field can hardly work under the challenges associated with in-bed human behavior monitoring, such as significant illumination changes (e.g., full darkness at night), heavy occlusion (e.g., covering by a sheet or blanket), as well as the privacy concerns that mitigate large-scale data collection, necessary for any deep learning-based model training. The data quality challenges and privacy concerns have hindered the use of advanced vision-based in-bed behavior monitoring systems at home, which during the recent COVID-19 pandemic could have been an effective way to control the spread of the virus by avoiding in-person visits to clinics.",

      "abstract": "In recent days, it is becoming essential to ensure that the outcomes of signal processing methods based on machine learning (ML) data-driven models can provide interpretable predictions. The interpretability of ML models can be defined as the capability to understand the reasons that contributed to generating a given outcome in a complex autonomous or semi-autonomous system. The necessity of interpretability is often related to the evaluation of performances in complex systems and the acceptance of agents’ automatization processes where critical high-risk decisions have to be taken. This paper concentrates on one of the core functionality of such systems, i.e., abnormality detection, and on choosing a model representation modality based on a data-driven machine learning (ML) technique such that the outcomes become interpretable. The interpretability in this work is achieved through graph matching of semantic level vocabulary generated from the data and their relationships. The proposed approach assumes that the data-driven models to be chosen should support emergent self-awareness (SA) of the agents at multiple abstraction levels. It is demonstrated that the capability of incrementally updating learned representation models based on progressive experiences of the agent is shown to be strictly related to interpretability capability. As a case study, abnormality detection is analyzed as a primary feature of the collective awareness (CA) of a network of vehicles performing cooperative behaviors. Each vehicle is considered an example of an Internet of Things (IoT) node, therefore providing results that can be generalized to an IoT framework where agents have different sensors, actuators, and tasks to be accomplished. The capability of a model to allow evaluation of abnormalities at different levels of abstraction in the learned models is addressed as a key aspect for interpretability.",

Anomalies w.r.t. expected vehicle motion and image content are extracted to guide the localization, signal when the localization results are not trustworthy and explain the reason for the failure. During the training phase, a Dynamic Bayesian Network model is learned, which couples positional and video data. To learn it, clustering is performed on the odometry data, and a modified Kalman Variational Autoencoder is built over the video data. During the testing phase, a Coupled Markov Jump Particle Filter leverages the learned Dynamic Bayesian Network to extract anomalies and to estimate the vehicle's position, given only camera data. The proposed method is evaluated on two real-world datasets of a vehicle performing perimeter monitoring of a closed environment and of a shopping cart moving in a supermarket.",

Where agent-environment interactions can be costly, reinforcement learning is critical, and imitation learning suffers significantly from learning hierarchical policies when the imitative agent encounters an unobserved state by the expert agent. We propose a probabilistic incremental imitation learning method that employs a Dynamic Bayesian Network to encode observed teaching-agent's behaviors. The presented model grows and matures based on imitation loss formulation at a discrete level in the online learning procedure. The learning agent is trained by using long-term predictions from the generative learning model to replicate the teacher's motion while learning how to choose an appropriate action through new experiences.

      "abstract": "Classical imitation learning methods suffer substantially from the learning hierarchical policies when the imitative agent faces an unobserved state by the expert agent. To address these drawbacks, we propose an online active learning through active inference approach that encodes the expert's demonstrations based on observation-action to improve the learner's future motion prediction. For this purpose, we provide a switching Dynamic Bayesian Network based on the dynamic interaction between the expert agent and another object in its surrounding as a reference model, which we exploit to initialize an incremental probabilistic learning model. This learning model grows and matures based on the free-energy formulation and message passing of active inference dynamically at discrete and continuous levels in an online active learning phase. In this scheme, generalized states of the learning world are represented as distance-vector, where it is the learner's observation concerning its interaction with a moving object. Considering the distance vector entail intentions, it enables action prediction evaluation in a prospective sense. We illustrate these points using simulations of driving intelligent agents. The learning agent is trained by using long-term predictions from the generative learning model to reproduce the expert's motion while learning how to select a suitable action through new experiences. Our results affirm that a Dynamic Bayesian optimal approach provides a principled framework and outperforms conventional reinforcement learning methods. Furthermore, it endorses the general formulation of action prediction as active inference.",

The mass of an object constitutes key information for the robot to correctly regulate the force required to grasp the container. We propose a single RGB-D camera-based method to locate a manipulated container and estimate its empty mass i.e., independently of the presence of the content. The method first automatically selects a number of candidate containers based on the distance with the fixed frontal view, then averages the mass predictions of a lightweight model to provide the final estimation. Results on the CORSMAL Containers Manipulation dataset show that the proposed method estimates empty container mass obtaining a score of 71.08% under different lighting or filling conditions.",

This paper combines Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) and Neural Networks (NNs) and proposes a method for detecting anomalies in video data at different abstraction levels. We use a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to reduce the dimensionality of video frames, and Optical Flows between subsequent images, generating a latent space that captures both visual and dynamical information and that is comparable to low-dimensional sensory data (e.g., positioning, steering angle). An Adapted Markov Jump Particle Filter is employed to predict the following frames and detect anomalies in video data. Our method's evaluation is executed using different video data from a semi-autonomous vehicle performing different tasks in a closed environment. Tests on benchmark anomaly detection datasets have additionally been conducted.",

      "abstract": "A novel approach is presented for learning probabilistic transition matrices from temporal data series as switching models based on Generalized States (GS). An observed data sequence is analyzed by a reference filter whose errors are clustered. Each cluster is associated with a dynamic flow model, which described as a parametric linear attractor. The set of linear attractors define the Hierarchical Generalized Dynamic Bayesian Network (H-GDBN), which encodes a learned model of the obtained sequence. A Markov Jump Particle Filter (MJPF) uses H-GDBN's probabilistic information to make inferences at a multilevel scale and facilitates the detection of abnormalities. This paper shows how transition matrices can be obtained as an integral part of the clustering step by employing the advantages of GSs, enabling a unique optimal criterion for learning flow models at discrete and continuous levels of H-GDBN. For evaluating the proposed method, odometry and proprioceptive control data from an autonomous vehicle are employed to learn H-GDBNs. Learned H-GDBN are used to detect abnormalities when vehicle encounter any abnormal situation. Performance evaluation based on ROC curves is provided to select the optimal transition matrix.",

Detecting an abnormal motion of objects using video sequences has been widely studied in the last decade. This paper proposes a method to detect abnormal motion by using sequences of LiDARs' point-clouds. Estimation of scene flows enables to compute the motion field in 3D space. Nearest point loss and Cosine-Cycle Consistency loss are proposed to estimate the scene flows of point-clouds in an unsupervised way. The direction of motion of the nearest object is represented in a 3D grid-like structure called VoxCF. VoxCF is used as an input for the extraction of dynamic features that encode the direction of objects' motion. Dynamic features are used to make decisions about the abnormal motion by making predictions from the Long short-term Memory (LSTM) network. The proposed method has been validated by performing real experiments with AV, and the obtained results show the precise detection of abnormal motion.",

The proposed system employs the inverse reinforcement learning method to a coupled Dynamic Bayesian Network to facilitate dynamic learning in an interactive system. This method studies the interaction at both discrete and continuous levels by identifying inter-relationships between the objects to facilitate the prediction of an expert agent. We evaluate the learning procedure in the scene of learner agent based on probabilistic reward function. Our goal is to estimate policies that predict matched trajectories with the observed one by minimizing the Kullback-Leiber divergence.

      "abstract": "The technology for autonomous vehicles is close to replacing human drivers by artificial systems endowed with high-level decision-making capabilities. In this regard, systems must learn about the usual vehicle's behavior to predict imminent difficulties before they happen. An autonomous agent should be capable of continuously interacting with multi-modal dynamic environments while learning unseen novel concepts. Such environments are not often available to train the agent on it, so the agent should have an understanding of its own capacities and limitations. This understanding is usually called self-awareness. This paper proposes a multi-modal self-awareness modeling of signals coming from different sources. This paper shows how different machine learning techniques can be used under a generic framework to learn single modality models by using Dynamic Bayesian Networks. In the presented case, a probabilistic switching model and a bank of generative adversarial networks are employed to model a vehicle's positional and visual information respectively. Our results include experiments performed on a real vehicle, highlighting the potentiality of the proposed approach at detecting abnormalities in real scenarios.",

      "abstract": "A novel approach is proposed for multimodal collective awareness (CA) of multiple networked intelligent agents. Each agent is here considered as an Internet-of-Things (IoT) node equipped with machine learning capabilities; CA aims to provide the network with updated causal knowledge of the state of execution of actions of each node performing a joint task, with particular attention to anomalies that can arise. Data-driven dynamic Bayesian models learned from multisensory data recorded during the normal realization of a joint task (agent network experience) are used for distributed state estimation of agents and detection of abnormalities. A set of switching dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) models collectively learned in a training phase, each related to particular sensorial modality, is used to allow each agent in the network to perform synchronous estimation of possible abnormalities occurring when a new task of the same type is jointly performed. Collective DBN (CDBN) learning is performed by unsupervised clustering of generalized errors (GEs) obtained from a starting generalized model. A growing neural gas (GNG) algorithm is used as a basis to learn the discrete switching variables at the semantic level. Conditional probabilities linking nodes in the CDBN models are estimated using obtained clusters. CDBN models are associated with a Bayesian inference method, namely, distributed Markov jump particle filter (D-MJPF), employed for joint state estimation and abnormality detection. The effects of networking protocols and of communications in the estimation of state and abnormalities are analyzed. Performance is evaluated by using a small network of two autonomous vehicles performing joint navigation tasks in a controlled environment. In the proposed method, first the sharing of observations is considered in ideal condition, and then the effects of a wireless communication channel have been analyzed for the collective abnormality estimation of the agents. Rician wireless channel and the usage of two protocols (i.e., IEEE 802.11p and IEEE 802.15.4) along with different channel conditions are considered as well.",

These techniques represent an essential step also for artificial self-aware systems that can continually learn from new situations. In this chapter, we present a semisupervised method for the detection of anomalies for this type of self-aware agents. The described method leverages the message-passing capability of Generalized Dynamic Bayesian Networks (GDBNs) to provide anomalies at different abstraction levels for diverse types of time-series data (i.e., both low-dimensional and high-dimensional). The detected anomalies could consequently be employed to enable the system to evolve by integrating the new acquired knowledge. To present a case study for the description of the anomaly detection method, we propose to use multisensory data from a semiautonomous vehicle performing different tasks in a closed environment.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes a method for performing future-frame prediction and anomaly detection on video data in a multi-modal framework based on Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs). In particular, odometry data and video data from a moving vehicle are fused. A Markov Jump Particle Filter (MJPF) is learned on odometry data, and its features are used to aid the learning of a Kalman Variational Autoencoder (KVAE) on video data. Consequently, anomaly detection can be performed on video data using the learned model. We evaluate the proposed method using multi-modal data from a vehicle performing different tasks in a closed environment.",

      "abstract": "The evolution of Intelligent Transportation Systems in recent times necessitates the development of self-awareness in agents. Before the intensive use of Machine Learning, the detection of abnormalities was manually programmed by checking every variable and creating huge nested conditions that are very difficult to track. This paper aims to introduce a novel method to develop self-awareness in autonomous vehicles that mainly focuses on detecting abnormal situations around the considered agents. Multi-sensory time-series data from the vehicles are used to develop the data-driven Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) models used for future state prediction and the detection of dynamic abnormalities. Moreover, an initial level collective awareness model that can perform joint anomaly detection in co-operative tasks is proposed. The GNG algorithm learns the DBN models’ discrete node variables; probabilistic transition links connect the node variables. A Markov Jump Particle Filter (MJPF) is applied to predict future states and detect when the vehicle is potentially misbehaving using learned DBNs as filter parameters. In this paper, datasets from real experiments of autonomous vehicles performing various tasks used to learn and test a set of switching DBN models.",

By employing an adapted Markov Jump Particle Filter, the proposed method recognizes new situations and integrates them as predictive models avoiding catastrophic forgetting of previously learned tasks.

The proposed optimization facilitates obtaining a low number of discrete components while guaranteeing a high performance at predicting and detecting abnormalities in time series of data. Our method is composed of a two-step clustering approach that first considers a partitional clustering to obtain an initial semantic representation of data. Then it performs a hierarchical clustering to decrease the number of clusters while preserving coherent models employed for predicting future time instances at the testing phase. Odometry data from a real vehicle that performs different tasks in a closed, controlled environment is used to evaluate the proposed method.",

      "abstract": "Millimeter Wave (mmWave) band can be a solution to serve the vast number of Internet of Things (IoT) and Vehicle to Everything (V2X) devices. In this context, Cognitive Radio (CR) is capable of managing the mmWave spectrum sharing efficiently. However, Cognitive mmWave Radios are vulnerable to malicious users due to the complex dynamic radio environment and the shared access medium. This indicates the necessity to implement techniques able to detect precisely any anomalous behaviour in the spectrum to build secure and efficient radios. In this work, we propose a comparison framework between deep generative models: Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (C-GAN), Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Network (AC-GAN), and Variational Auto Encoder (VAE) used to detect anomalies inside the dynamic radio spectrum. For the sake of the evaluation, a real mmWave dataset is used, and results show that all of the models achieve high probability in detecting spectrum anomalies. Especially, AC-GAN that outperforms C-GAN and VAE in terms of accuracy and probability of detection.",

      "abstract": "Cellular connectivity for a massive number of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) will overcrowd the radio spectrum and cause spectrum scarcity. Incorporating Cognitive Radio (CR) with UAVs (Cognitive-UAV-Radios) has been proposed to overcome such an issue. However, the broadcasting nature of CR and the dominant line-of-sight links of UAV makes the Cognitive-UAV-Radios susceptible to jamming attacks. In this paper, we propose a framework to detect smart jammer, which locates and attacks the UAV commands with low Jamming-to-Signal-Power-Ratio (JSR). Smart jammer is more challenging than the types of jammers that always require high power values. Our work focuses on learning a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) to model and analyze the signals' behaviour statistically. A Markov Jump Particle Filter (MJPF) is employed to perform predictions and consequently detect jamming signals. The results are satisfactory in terms of detection probability and false alarm rate that outperform the conventional Energy Detector approach.",

      "abstract": "In a computational context, self-awareness (SA) is a capability of an autonomous system to describe the acquired experience about itself and its surrounding environment with appropriate models and correlate them incrementally with the currently perceived situation to expand its knowledge continuously. This article introduces a bio-inspired framework for generative and descriptive dynamic models that support SA computationally and efficiently. Generative models facilitate predicting future states, while descriptive models enable the selection of the representation that best fits the current observation. Our framework is founded on the analysis and extension of three bio-inspired theories that have studied SA from different viewpoints, and we demonstrate how probabilistic techniques, such as cognitive dynamic Bayesian networks and generalized filtering paradigms, can learn appropriate models from multidimensional proprioceptive and exteroceptive signals acquired by the autonomous system. We discuss essential capabilities for SA and show how our modeling framework supports these capabilities in theory and through a case study where a mobile robot uses multisensorial data to determine its internal and environmental state as well as distinguishing among normal and abnormal behaviors.",

      "abstract": "The advancements in connected and autonomous vehicles in these times demand the availability of tools providing the agents with the capability to be aware and predict their own states and context dynamics. This article presents a novel approach to develop an initial level of collective awareness (CA) in a network of intelligent agents. A specific collective self-awareness functionality is considered, namely, agent-centered detection of abnormal situations present in the environment around any agent in the network. Moreover, the agent should be capable of analyzing how such abnormalities can influence the future actions of each agent. Data-driven dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) models learned from time series of sensory data recorded during the realization of tasks (agent network experiences) are here used for abnormality detection and prediction. A set of DBNs, each related to an agent, is used to allow the agents in the network to reach synchronously aware possible abnormalities occurring when available models are used on a new instance of the task for which DBNs have been learned. A growing neural gas (GNG) algorithm is used to learn the node variables and conditional probabilities linking nodes in the DBN models; a Markov jump particle filter (MJPF) is employed for state estimation and abnormality detection in each agent using learned DBNs as filter parameters. Performance metrics are discussed to asses the algorithm's reliability and accuracy. The impact is also evaluated by the communication channel used by the network to share the data sensed in a distributed way by each agent of the network. The IEEE 802.11p protocol standard has been considered for communication among agents. Performances of the DBN-based abnormality detection models under different channel and source conditions are discussed. The effects of distances among agents and of the delays and packet losses are analyzed in different scenario categories (urban, suburban, and rural). Real data sets are also used acquired by autonomous vehicles performing different tasks in a controlled environment.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes a method to detect abnormal motions in real vehicle situations based on trajectory data. Our approach uses a Gaussian process (GP) regression that facilitates to approximate expected vehicle's movements over a whole environment based on sparse observed data. The main contribution of this paper consists in decomposing the GP regression into spatial zones, where quasi-constant velocity models are valid. Such obtained models are employed to build a set of Kalman filters that encode observed vehicle's dynamics. This paper shows how proposed filters enable the online identification of abnormal motions. Detected abnormalities can be modeled and learned incrementally, automatically by intelligent systems. The proposed methodology is tested on real data produced by a vehicle that interacts with pedestrians in a closed environment. Automatic detection of abnormal motions benefits the traffic scene understanding and facilitates to close the gap between human driving and autonomous vehicle awareness.",

      "abstract": "Introducing a data-driven Self-Awareness (SA) module in Cognitive Radio (CR) can support the system to establish secure networks against various attacks from malicious users. Such users can manipulate the radio spectrum in order to make the CR learn wrong behaviours and take mistaken actions. A basic SA module includes the ability to learn generative models and detect abnormalities inside the radio spectrum. In this work, we propose and implement Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based Abnormality Detection techniques at the physical (PHY)-layer in CR enabled by learning Generative Models. Specifically, two real-world practical applications related to different data dimensionality and sampling rates are presented. The first application implements the Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (C-GAN) investigated on generalized state vectors extracted from spectrum representation samples to study the dynamic behaviour of the wideband signal. While the second application is based on learning a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) model from a generalized state vector which contains sub-bands information extracted from the radio spectrum. Results show that both of the proposed methods are capable of detecting abnormal signals in the spectrum and pave the road towards Self-Aware radio.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) attracted both industry and research community owing to their fascinating features like mobility, deployment flexibility and strong Line of Sight (LoS) links. The integration of Cognitive Radio (CR) can greatly help UAVs to overcome several issues especially spectrum scarcity. However, the dynamic radio environment in CR and the strong dependence of safe communications from LoS channels integrity in UAV communications make the Cognitive- UAV-Radio vulnerable to jamming attacks. This work aims to study the integration of CR and UAVs introducing a Self- Awareness (SA) framework from the physical layer security perspective. Under the SA framework, a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) model is proposed as a representation of the radio environment and a modified Markov Jump Particle Filter (MJPF) is employed for prediction and state estimation purposes. A novel jammer detection framework is proposed that allows the UAV to perform abnormality evaluation at different hierarchical levels. The jammer is shown to be located effectively in both time and frequency domains. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed framework in terms of detection probability and accuracy.",

A clustering approach is used to discretise continuous agents' states related to a specific task into a set of nodes with similar objectives. Additionally, a probabilistic transition matrix between nodes is used as edges weights to build a graph. In this paper, we extract an abnormal area based on a sub-graph that encodes the differences between coupled of activities. Such sub-graph is obtained by applying a threshold on the optimal transport matrix, which is obtained through the graph matching procedure.

Among such emerging technologies, the Internet of Things (IoT) is gaining a lot of popularity and attention in almost every field. IoT devices have to be equipped with cognitive capabilities to enhance spectrum utilization by sensing and learning the surrounding environment. IoT network is susceptible to the various jamming attacks which interrupt users communication. In this paper, two systems (Single and Bank-Parallel) have been proposed to implement a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) Model to detect jammer in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) sub-carriers modulated with different M-QAM. The comparison of the two systems has been evaluated by simulation results after analyzing the effect of self-organizing map's (SOM) size on the performance of the proposed systems in relation to M-QAM modulation.",

      "abstract": "Increasing interest in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly referred to as drones, has occurred in recent years. Search and rescue scenarios where humans in emergency situations need to be quickly found in difficult-toaccess areas constitute an important field of application for this technology. Drones have already been used by humanitarian organizations in countries such as Haiti and the Philippines to map areas after a natural disaster using high-resolution embedded cameras, as documented in a recent United Nations report [1]. Although research efforts have focused mostly on developing video-based solutions for this task [2], UAV-embedded audio-based localization has received relatively less attention [3]-[7]. However, UAVs equipped with a microphone array could be of critical help to localize people in emergency situations, especially when video sensors are limited by a lack of visual feedback due to bad lighting conditions (such as at night or in fog) or obstacles limiting the field of view (Figure 1).",

      "abstract": "Technologies such as cognitive radio and dynamic spectrum access rely on spectrum sensing which provides wireless devices with information about the radio spectrum in the surrounding environment. One of the main challenges in wireless communications is the interference caused by malicious users on the shared spectrum. In this manuscript, an artificial intelligence enabled cognitive radio framework is proposed at system-level as part of a cyclic spectrum intelligence algorithm for interference mitigation in wideband radios. It exploits the cyclostationary feature of signals to differentiate users with different modulation schemes and an artificial neural network as classifier to detect potential malicious users. A dataset consisting of experimental modulated and dynamic signals is recorded by spectrum measurements with an in-house software defined radio testbed and then processed. Cyclostationary features are extracted for each detected signal and fed to a neural network classifier as training and testing data in a complex and dynamic scenario. Results highlight a classification rate of $∼1$ 1 in most of cases, even at low transmission power. A comparison with two previous works with hand-crafted features, which employ an energy detector-based classifier and a naive Bayes-based classifier, respectively, is discussed.",

The proposed method produces multiple inference models by considering several features of the observed data. This work facilitates the obtainment of the most precise features for predicting future instances and detecting abnormalities. Growing neural gas (GNG) is employed for clustering multisensory data into a set of nodes that provide a semantic interpretation of data and define local linear models for prediction purposes. Our method uses a Markov Jump particle filter (MJPF) for state estimation and abnormality detection. The proposed method can be used for selecting the optimal set features to be shared in networking operations such that state prediction, decision-making, and abnormality detection processes are favored.

      "abstract": "The proliferation of interconnected objects in the Internet of Things (IoT) can be benefit from integration of cognitive radio (CR) technologies at the network level. IoT networks equipped with cognitive capabilities can help to effectively alleviate the problem of spectrum scarcity. However, the IoT network can suffer from jammer attacks that interfere with user transmissions and disrupt communications. In this paper, we consider a CR-IoT network based on Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) modulation scheme and a reactive jammer is hypothesized to be present in the network. A jammer detection method is proposed that is based on learning a switching Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) from normal OFDM data transmissions that is capable to detect abnormal situations. The proposed model is shown to be capable to detect and locate multiple jammers. The comparison with a conventional energy detection shows the validity of the proposed approach.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive radio (CR) integrates results from software-defined radio (SDR), machine learning (ML), and neuroscience for smart radio transmission devices. SDR enables devices to be digitally and dynamically configured in online applications; methodologies and techniques developed to introduce self-awareness in existing systems can be based on ML. Specifically, CR can adaptively regulate its internal parameters in response to the changes in the surrounding environment. New physical layer security issues are also emerging, for example, smart jamming attacks aim to reduce the quality of service or to disrupt legitimate communications. In this context, the electromagnetic spectrum represents the environment, while signals inside it are the individual entities. A CR-to-spectrum interaction consists of a dynamic process that can be driven by a CR device. Learning dynamic and measurement models from spectrum data is the main objective in CR applications. To learn a model, statistical signal processing techniques can be used. Such models can be considered as parametric Bayesian filters that allow a CR to estimate current state of observed entities (including CR itself) and to predict their actions in the near future. Adaptive hierarchical Bayesian filters able to cover nonstationary entity behaviors can be described through probabilistic graphical models (PGM). Interacting entities can be modelled by coupling multiple PGMs related to different entities. In this chapter, state-of-the-art on representation and learning of dynamic models for physical layer security is introduced along with some future directions. An experimental framework is then presented with two currently investigated applications: Spectrum Intelligence and TV White Spaces (TVWS).",

This paper introduces a lightweight security approach for smart camera IoT applications based on elliptic-curve (EC) signcryption that performs data signing and encryption in a single step. We deploy signcryption to efficiently protect sensitive data onboard the cameras and secure the data transfer from multiple cameras to multiple monitoring devices. Our multi-sender/multi-receiver approach provides integrity, authenticity, and confidentiality of data with decryption fairness for multiple receivers throughout the entire lifetime of the data. It further provides public verifiability and forward secrecy of data. Our certificateless multi-receiver aggregate-signcryption protection has been implemented for a smart camera IoT scenario, and the runtime and communication effort has been compared with single-sender/single-receiver and multi-sender/single-receiver setups.",

      "abstract": "In this chapter, dynamic wideband signals with high sampling rate are analysed through the discrete Stockwell transform (ST). To this end, a reduced complexity ST-based transform with independent time and frequency resolution is investigated. We call it dual-resolution approach. It results in a new strategy based on a trade-off between the time–frequency resolution and the ST computational time addressing the problem of large amount of samples in wideband signals. Short-time Fourier transform (STFT) representation is also included to discuss the applicability to feature-based methodologies in a Cognitive Radio context. Real modulated signals are generated by a Software-Defined Radio testbed to validate the dual-resolution technique. Just 11–20% of the time necessary to generate the T matrix without dual-resolution is requested and 3–12% of the ST computational time with respect to the conventional ST. While, the number of samples can be till four times larger.",

Additionally, we describe the design, development, and assessment of a bidirectional ambient display platform to support real-time activity awareness and social connectedness in mediated AAL contexts. In a semi-controlled study, we evaluate a conglomerate of activity-based lighting displays, to determine the effects of real-time bidirectional deployment on behaviour and social connectedness. Exploiting everyday objects, human activity levels are projected with a Philips Hue lamp, LED wallet, and LED walking cane, which render this information based on predefined patterns of light. Results from the current study show tendencies toward (1) an increase in implicit social interactions (e.g., the sense of experienced social presence and connectedness), (2) more positive social behaviours between the elderly and their caregivers in mediated AAL contexts, and (3) sporadic moments of interpersonal activity synchrony however, further investigation is necessary to determine the extent of this variable in mediated AAL contexts.",

      "abstract": "Providing an estimation of the emotional states of individuals increases the insights on the state of a crowd beyond simple normal/abnormal situations or behaviour classification. Methods intended for identifying emotions in individuals are mainly based on facial and body expressions, or even physiological measurements which are not suited for crowded environments as the available information in crowds is usually limited to that provided by surveillance cameras where the face and body of pedestrians can often suffer from occlusion. This work proposes an approach for analysing walking behaviour and exploiting the interplay of motivations and expectations in the emotions of pedestrians. Real-world data is used to test the prediction of motivations and annotations on the emotional state of pedestrians are added to evaluate the proposed method's capability to estimate emotional states. The conducted experiments show significant improvements over previous methods for estimating motivations and consistent results to the estimation of emotions.",

      "abstract": "This paper focuses on multi-sensor anomaly detection for moving cognitive agents using both external and private first-person visual observations. Both observation types are used to characterize agents motion in a given environment. The proposed method generates locally uniform motion models by dividing a Gaussian process that approximates agents displacements on the scene and provides a Shared Level (SL) self-awareness based on Environment Centered (EC) models. Such models are then used to train in a semi-unsupervised way a set of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) that produce an estimation of external and internal parameters of moving agents. Obtained results exemplify the feasibility of using multi-perspective data for predicting and analyzing trajectory information.",

Proposed technique is based on the availability of synchronized multi-sensor dynamic data related to different maneuvering tasks performed by a human operator. It is shown that different machine learning approaches can be used to first learn single modality models using coupled Dynamic Bayesian Networks; such models are then correlated at event level to discover contextual multimodal concepts. In the presented case, visual perception and localization are used as modalities. Cross-correlations among modalities in time is discovered from data and are described as probabilistic links connecting shared and private multi-modal DBNs at the event (discrete) level. Results are presented on experiments performed on an autonomous vehicle, highlighting potentiality of the proposed approach to allow anomaly detection and autonomous decision making based on learned self-awareness models.",

In this paper, dynamic incremental self-awareness (SA) models are proposed that allow experiences done by an agent to be modeled in a hierarchical fashion, starting from more simple situations to more structured ones. Each situation is learned from subsets of private agent perception data as a model capable to predict normal behaviors and detect abnormalities. Hierarchical SA models have been already proposed using low dimensional sensorial inputs. In this work, a hierarchical model is introduced by means of a cross-modal Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) processing high dimensional visual data. Different levels of the GANs are detected in a self-supervised manner using GANs discriminators decision boundaries. Real experiments on semi-autonomous ground vehicles are presented.",

Location, velocity and time of appearance are considered as features for recognizing and modeling motions of objects. In a training phase, a discretization of the proposed features is performed by using a self-organizing map approach such that a set of clusters (feature vocabulary) is created for describing trajectories. A cluster dissimilarity measure based on a weighted fusion of features facilitates the recognition of trajectory classes in an incremental way. As a result, an unsupervised method for encoding observed motion information and identifying trajectory patterns is proposed in this article. The method is evaluated with real and simulated data. Additionally' comparisons with previous works show the benefits of our method when encoding and identifying motion patterns in video sequences.",

The detection is achieved by classifying the distinct movements of people in crowds, and those patterns can be different and can be classified as normal and abnormal activities. Statistical features are extracted from the dataset collected by applying sliding time window operations. A model for classifying movements is trained by using Random Forest technique. The system was tested by using two datasets collected from mobile phones during social events gathering. Results show that mobile data can be used to detect anomalies in crowds as an alternative to video sensors with significant performances. Our approach is the first to detect any unusual behaviour in crowd with non-visual data, which is simple to train and easy to deploy. We also present our dataset for public research as there is no such dataset available to perform experiments on crowds for detecting unusual behaviours.",

In an era of pervasive computing (i.e. the proliferation of ever-present smart devices), governments, companies, and academic institutions are working together to develop and promote cutting-edge initiatives that sustain the quality of life and address the complexities and opportunities of an ageing world. In this chapter, we propose a user-centred approach within a multidisciplinary framework, which incorporates human-computer interaction, social science, signal processing, and pervasive computing, to inspire the design of a bidirectional context-aware system to support social connectedness between the elderly and their caregivers. Following a review of previous works on socio-technical awareness systems and human activity recognition models, we describe our user-driven methodological approach and demonstrate the value and potential benefits of bidirectional activity-based peripheral systems within ambient assisted living environments.

      "abstract": "Cognitive radio is a promising technology for frequency allocation to improve the spectrum utilization efficiency of licensed bands. However, in recent years, the attention of the researchers is focused on security issues that have to be faced by cognitive radio technology. One of the most important issues consists of radio frequency jamming attacks, where adversaries can use on-the-fly reconfigurability and learning capabilities of cognitive radios in order to devise and deploy advanced jamming tactics. Jamming attacks can noticeably affect the performance of wireless communication systems and can lead to significant overhead in terms of data re-transmission and increased power consumption. In this article, a novel compressed sensing-based jammer detection algorithm is proposed using cyclic spectral analysis and artificial neural networks for wideband cognitive radios. A wideband spectrum is considered that is composed of multiple narrowband signals. Narrowband signals can be legitimate or jamming signals. Compressed sensing is used to reduce the overhead of the analog-to-digital conversion and it allows one to estimate a wideband spectrum with sub-Nyquist rate sampling. After the signal has been estimated, the second-order statistics, namely, spectral correlation function, is computed to extract cyclic features of the wideband signal. Finally, a pre-trained artificial neural network is proposed to classify each narrowband signal as a legitimate or jamming signal. Performances of proposed algorithm are shown with Monte-Carlo simulations under different empirical setups.",

It is proposed a parametric representation of velocity fields ruling the dynamics of moving agents. It is assumed that attractive spots in the environment are responsible for modifying the motion of agents. A switching model is used to describe near and far velocity fields, which in turn are used to learn attractive characteristics of environments. The effect of such areas is considered radial over all the scene. Based on the estimation of attractive areas, a map that describes their effects in terms of their localizations, ranges of action, and intensities is derived in an online way. Information of static attractive areas is added dynamically into a set of filters that describes possible interactions between moving agents and an environment. The proposed approach is first evaluated on synthetic data; posteriorly, the method is applied on real trajectories coming from moving pedestrians in an indoor environment.",

      "abstract": "The introduction of cognitive radio enables dynamic spectrum access for higher spectrum utilization, due to its ability of awareness of their environment. However, the introduction of cognitive radio technology brings new challenges to wireless networks security. Due to intelligent nature of the attackers, many of the radio frequency jamming attacks can be stealthy by nature. The stealthy jamming attacks can significantly impact the performance of the wireless communication system and can lead to significant overhead in terms of retransmission and increment of power consumption. This paper presents a new physical layer approach for stealthy jammer detection in wide-band (WB) cognitive radio networks. The proposed algorithm consider a WB consists of multiple narrow-band sub-bands (SB), which can be occupied by licit or jamming signals. The cyclostationary spectral analysis is performed on this WB signal to compute spectral correlation function (SCF). The alpha profile is extracted from the SCF and used as input features to artificial neural network (ANN), which classify each NB signal as a licit signal or a jamming signal. In the end, the performance of the proposed approach is shown with the help of Monte-Carlo simulations under different empirical setups.",

In a setting where different behaviors can arise, one can assume that each of them corresponds to different motivational states of observed entities. Here, those motivations are understood as goal positions or spots where entities seek to arrive. To build prediction models based on that idea, we present an unsupervised method to estimate motivational spots actively. Additionally, we use the output of such process to refine an adaptive system modeling the dynamics of inferred hidden causes of observed data. The whole method uses deep variational methods, and particularly, the network estimating motivations is trained through dynamic programming. Results show that modeling the dynamics of entities can be better achieved by integrating information about motivational spots. Notably, a network modeling the dynamics converges faster through the incorporation of information about motivations.",

A formalism based on deep learning implementations of variational methods and Bayesian filtering theory is presented. It is explained how the proposed method is capable of modeling the environment to mimic behaviors in an observed interaction by building internal representations and discovering temporal and causal relations. The method is evaluated in a typical surveillance scenario, i.e., perimeter monitoring. It is shown that the vehicle learns how to drive itself by simultaneously observing its surroundings and the actions taken by a human driver for a given task. That is achieved by embedding knowledge regarding perception-action couplings in dynamic representational states used to produce action flows. Thereby, representations link sensory data to control signals. In particular, the representational states associate visual features to stable action concepts such as turning or going straight.",

This paper proposes an unsupervised strategy based on global features and manifold learning to endow wearable cameras with contextual information regarding the light conditions and the location captured. Results show that non-linear manifold methods can capture contextual patterns from global features without compromising large computational resources.

Since cameras often capture highly sensitive information, security is a major concern. Our approach towards data security for smart cameras is rooted on protecting the captured images by signcryption based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). Signcryption achieves resource-efficiency by performing data signing and encryption in a single step. By running the signcryption on the sensing unit, we can relax some security assumptions for the camera host unit which typically runs a complex software stack. We introduce our system architecture motivated by a typical case study for camera-based IoT applications, evaluate security properties and present performance results of an ARM-based implementation.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive radio (CR) is an enabling technology for future wireless spectrum allocation to improve the use of licensed spectrum by enabling unlicensed users equipped with CRs to coexist with incumbent users in licensed spectrum bands while causing no interference to incumbent communication. However, security challenges faced by CR technology are still a research topic. One of the prevailing challenges, is the radio frequency jamming attack, where adversaries are able to exploit on-the-fly reconfigurability potentials and learning mechanism of cognitive radios in order to devise and deploy advanced jamming tactics. These attacks can significantly impact the performance of wireless communication systems and lead to significant overheads in terms of retransmission and increment of power consumption. In this work, a new jammer detection algorithm is proposed for wide-band (WB) radios. The proposed approach assumes a WB spectrum occupied by various narrow-band (NB) signals, which can be either legitimate or jamming signals. First, the received WB signal is recovered from sub-Nyquist rate samples using compressed sensing. Compressed sensing is used to alleviate Nyquist rate sampling requirements at the receiver A/D converter. After the Nyquist rate signal has been recoverd, a cyclostationary spectral analysis is performed on this estimated WB signal to compute spectral correlation function (SCF). The alpha profile is then extracted from SCF and used to classify each NB signal as a licit signal or illicit signal. In the end, the performance of the algorithm is shown with the help of Monte-Carlo simulations under different empirical setups.",

We propose to use Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs), which are trained using normal frames and corresponding optical-flow images in order to learn an internal representation of the scene normality. Since our GANs are trained with only normal data, they are not able to generate abnormal events. At testing time the real data are compared with both the appearance and the motion representations reconstructed by our GANs and abnormal areas are detected by computing local differences. Experimental results on challenging abnormality detection datasets show the superiority of the proposed method compared to the state of the art in both frame-level and pixel-level abnormality detection tasks.",

      "abstract": "In this work, we present a method for building grounded representations by structuring the sensorimotor data of an agent. The aim is to encode sensory inputs into internal states that describe action-environment couplings, or relations that connect elements in a scene to action concepts. Thus, the environment is represented regarding the sensorimotor integrations required to interact with elements in it. Such representations are acquired for a particular task in which they serve to infer important states and generate control commands accordingly. Representations are learned in an unsupervised process and are assembled into probability distributions to capture uncertainty. That is achieved through variational methods using deep learning and dynamic programming, and an architecture partially inspired by active inference. During an interaction, future representational states and sensorimotor data are actively predicted, while the incoming sensory information is incorporated through prediction error. Results in a navigation task show that situated representations emerge as sensorimotor relations that are interpretable as action concepts, and which allow interpreting important elements in the environment to generate satisfactory actions. We argue that the acquisition of such capabilities relates to the prediction processes enabled by two mechanisms; first, state-transition models explicitly dependent on the generation of control commands, and secondly, a system trained through dynamic programming, which generates further predictions that relate sensory data to expected state changes.",

In particular, hand pose recognition plays a fundamental role in tasks such as gesture and activity recognition, which in turn represent the base for developing human-machine interfaces or augmented reality applications. In this work we propose a graph-based representation of hands seen from the point of view of the user, obtained through the shape-fitting capability of a modified Instantaneous Topological Map. Spectral analysis of the graph Laplacian allows to arrange eigenvalues in vectors of features, which prove to be discriminative in classifying the considered hand poses.",

This survey identifies different approaches as well as relevant work on crowd analysis by means of visual and non-visual techniques. Multidisciplinary research groups are addressing crowd phenomenon and its dynamics ranging from social, and psychological aspects to computational perspectives. The possibility to use smartphones as sensing devices and fuse this information with video sensors data, allows to better describe crowd dynamics and behaviors.

      "abstract": "Approximately, one-third to half of all food produced globally is wasted. In developed countries, roughly up to half of this food waste comes from consumers. In response to this, the UN has set goals to raise consumer awareness and reduce food waste by 50% before 2030. Our objective is to evaluate how emerging technologies could improve awareness in households. Inspired by future sensing possibilities, we envision a community-based social system that captures in-home food availability and waste patterns and uses this information to support awareness and sustainability. In this work, we describe an evaluation of a component that could be part of such a system. This component or concept, called Social Recipes, aims at encouraging food sharing by suggesting groups of related consumers recipes that are based on ingredients from different individuals or households. To evaluate Social Recipes, we conducted 3 user studies to see how it could raise awareness and reduce food waste and to suggest implications for its design. In the first two studies, we evaluated expected impacts of the concept. The third study was a home deployment, where Social Recipes were sent using technological probes for a more realistic experience. Here, we also evaluated it against the more common method of influence strategy in sustainability research that is restricted to feedback (i.e., eco-feedback). Our main findings showed that Social Recipes has raised awareness of in-home food availability and triggered food-related conversations among participants resulting in knowledge gain. However, Social Recipes alone was not perceived as effective in directly reducing food waste. And therefore, for the design of a community-based social system, we suggest another component to be added to the system that provides eco-feedback. This component was perceived as more effective in reducing food waste with impacts on awareness of waste generation and social surveillance. Overall, the aim of this work is to contribute to an understanding of how Social Recipes could impact consumers and how to design a community-based social (recipe) system that can be integrated in consumers daily activities for effective but pleasurable food waste prevention.",

      "abstract": "Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) applications leverage pervasive sensing and ambient intelligence technologies to enable older people to live independently and to support their social inclusion and connectedness. Wearable sensors can be used to gather the elderly's activities of daily living (ADLs) data, thus enabling remote monitoring. Lately, ambient displays have been deployed to relay activity information in the periphery of the caregivers' attention in order to increase awareness of the activities of the elderly and to create a sense of connectedness. Moreover, there is accumulated evidence demonstrating the ability of ambient displays to influence and promote social connectedness between the elderly and their caregivers. In recent years, intelligent ambient lighting, a subclass of ambient displays, is emerging as an effective tool for conveying physical activity information. Existing literature suggests lighting encodings or configurations combining color, rate of change, position and brightness to communicate such information. Within AAL, there is little empirical evidence surrounding ambient lighting encodings that support this cause effectively. In this paper, we present an exploratory study investigating how potential caregivers perceive and interpret ambient lighting configurations for presenting activity information of the elderly. User preference, change noticeability and accuracy of the interpretation of three ambient lighting configurations were evaluated.",

      "abstract": "The emergence of ubiquitous sensing and the Internet of Things (IoT) have inspired the development of 'smart' everyday objects, which offer tremendous opportunities for maintaining the quality of life in ambient assisted living (AAL) environments. Inspired by the future possibilities of connected everyday devices, we envision a peripheral activity-based awareness system that captures human activity information and renders this information to enhance context awareness and support social connectedness between the elderly and their caregivers. Leveraging ambient intelligence and IoT technologies, ambient displays can convey activity information in the periphery of our attention. In particular, light has been used as a means to display ambient information and there is scientific evidence that it can enhance well-being, interconnectedness, and improve productivity. In this paper, we undertake two studies, first through an exploratory study we investigate the features of light suitable for conveying subtle activity information within the periphery of the users' attention for promoting context awareness. Also, we examine the preferences, perceptions, and interpretations of ambient lighting configurations of prospective caregiver's for conveying the activity information of older adults. In a second study, we assess the implications of activity awareness through lighting on cognitive performance, moods, and social connectedness. The set-up and design decisions of the second study were partly informed by previous research and by the outcomes of the first experiment. Together, these studies provide additional design guidelines for representing activity information with ambient lighting and highlight potential benefits and usage possibilities for lighting displays within the AAL domain. Furthermore, the results indicate a significant effect of activity awareness on cognitive performance. However, there were no significant effects of activity awareness through lighting on moods and social connectedness. Finally, we discuss the design guidelines and implications of these findings for designing activity-based ambient lighting displays for AAL environments.",

      "abstract": "New research on ambient displays within ambient assisted living (AAL) environments, demonstrates solid potential for the application of bidirectional activity-based context aware systems for promoting social connectedness between the elderly and their caregivers. Using visual, auditory or tactile modalities, such systems can reveal subtle information concerning health and well-being and stimulate co-presence between the pair. In this paper, we present the design and development of an activity-based framework aimed at enabling the real-time viewing of bidirectional activity states between the elderly and their caregivers. This framework seeks to overcome the limitations of existing ambient displays deployed in AAL settings, which are in most cases unidirectional and confined to the homes of its users. Our bidirectional activity-based framework, is based on an extensive literature review, expert advice and user feedback, which informed the design decisions about the product features and functionality. The system exploits a highly accurate activity recognition model to facilitate real-time activity awareness and an “always connected” service through portable interactive devices for stimulating social connectedness within the AAL domain.",

      "abstract": "Wearable cameras allow people to record their daily activities from a user-centered (First Person Vision) perspective. Due to their favorable location, wearable cameras frequently capture the hands of the user, and may thus represent a promising user-machine interaction tool for different applications. Existent First Person Vision methods handle hand segmentation as a background-foreground problem, ignoring two important facts: i) hands are not a single “skin-like” moving element, but a pair of interacting cooperative entities, ii) close hand interactions may lead to hand-to-hand occlusions and, as a consequence, create a single hand-like segment. These facts complicate a proper understanding of hand movements and interactions. Our approach extends traditional background-foreground strategies, by including a hand-identification step (left-right) based on a Maxwell distribution of angle and position. Hand-to-hand occlusions are addressed by exploiting temporal superpixels. The experimental results show that, in addition to a reliable left/right hand-segmentation, our approach considerably improves the traditional background-foreground hand-segmentation.",

      "abstract": "Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) aims to create innovative technical solutions and services to support independent living among older adults, improve their quality of life and reduce the costs associated with health and social care. AAL systems provide health monitoring through sensor based technologies to preserve health and functional ability and facilitate social support for the ageing population. Human activity recognition (HAR) is an enabler for the development of robust AAL solutions, especially in safety critical environments. Therefore, HAR models applied within this domain (e.g. for fall detection or for providing contextual information to caregivers) need to be accurate to assist in developing reliable support systems. In this paper, we evaluate three machine learning algorithms, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM), a hybrid of Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and SVM (SVM-HMM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) applied on a dataset collected between the elderly and their caregiver counterparts. Detected activities will later serve as inputs to a bidirectional activity awareness system for increasing social connectedness. Results show high classification performances for all three algorithms. Specifically, the SVM-HMM hybrid demonstrates the best classification performance. In addition to this, we make our dataset publicly available for use by the machine learning community.",

Since the motion of agents can be affected by the presence of fixed objects, it is possible use the information about trajectories deviations to infer the presence of obstacles and estimate the forces involved in a scene. Artificial neural networks are used to estimate a non-parametric function related to the velocity field influencing moving agents. The proposed method is able to incrementally learn the velocity fields due to external static objects within the monitored environment. It determines whether an object has a repulsive or an attractive influence and provides an estimation of its position and size. As stationarity is assumed, i.e., time-invariance of force fields, learned observation models can be used as prior knowledge for estimating hierarchically the properties of new objects in a scene.",

      "abstract": "Estimation of emotions is an essential aspect in developing intelligent systems intended for crowded environments. However, emotion estimation in crowds remains a challenging problem due to the complexity in which human emotions are manifested and the capability of a system to perceive them in such conditions. This paper proposes a hierarchical Bayesian model to learn in unsupervised manner the behavior of individuals and of the crowd as a single entity, and explore the relation between behavior and emotions to infer emotional states. Information about the motion patterns of individuals are described using a self-organizing map, and a hierarchical Bayesian network builds probabilistic models to identify behaviors and infer the emotional state of individuals and the crowd. This model is trained and tested using data produced from simulated scenarios that resemble real-life environments. The conducted experiments tested the efficiency of our method to learn, detect and associate behaviors with emotional states yielding accuracy levels of 74% for individuals and 81% for the crowd, similar in performance with existing methods for pedestrian behavior detection but with novel concepts regarding the analysis of crowds.",

      "abstract": "Under a tracking framework, the definition of the target state is the basic step for automatic understanding of dynamic scenes. More specifically, far object tracking raises challenges related to the potentially abrupt size changes of the targets as they approach the sensor. If not handled, size changes can introduce heavy issues in data association and position estimation. This is why adaptability and self-awareness of a tracking module are desirable features. The paradigm of cognitive dynamic systems (CDSs) can provide a framework under which a continuously learning cognitive module can be designed. In particular, CDS theory describes a basic vocabulary of components that can be used as the founding blocks of a module capable to learn behavioral rules from continuous active interactions with the environment. This quality is the fundamental to deal with dynamic situations. In this paper we propose a general CDS-based approach to tracking. We show that such a CDS-inspired design can lead to the self-adaptability of a Bayesian tracker in fusing heterogeneous object features, overcoming size change issues. The experimental results on infrared sequences show how the proposed framework is able to outperform other existing far object tracking methods.",

      "abstract": "Throughout the 1990s, Software Defined Radio (SDR) technology was viewed almost exclusively as a solution for interoperability problems between various military standards, waveforms and devices. In the meantime, Cognitive Radio (CR) – a novel communication paradigm which embodies SDR with intelligence and self-reconfigurability properties – has emerged. Intelligence and on-the-fly self-reconfiguration abilities of CRs constitute an important next step in the Communications Electronic Warfare, as they may enable the jamming entities with the capabilities of devising and deploying advanced jamming tactics. Similarly, they may also aid the development of the advanced intelligent self-reconfigurable systems for jamming mitigation. This work outlines the development and implementation of the Spectrum Intelligence algorithm for Radio Frequency (RF) interference mitigation. The developed system is built upon the ideas of obtaining relevant spectrum-related data by using wideband energy detectors, performing narrowband waveform identification, extracting the waveforms’ parameters and properly classifying the waveforms. All relevant spectrum activities are continuously monitored and stored. Coupled with the self-reconfigurability of various transmission-related parameters, Spectrum Intelligence is the facilitator for the advanced interference mitigation strategies. The implementation is done on the Cognitive Radio test bed architecture which consists of two military Software Defined Radio terminals, each interconnected with the computationally powerful System-on-Module.",

      "abstract": "A new algorithm for jammer detection is proposed in this work for wide-band (WB) cognitive radio networks. First, the received WB signal, which is comprised of multiple narrow-band (NB) signals, is recovered from sub-Nyquist rate samples using compressed sensing. Compressed sensing allows us to alleviate Nyquist rate sampling requirements at the receiver A/D converter. After the Nyquist rate signal has been recovered, a cyclostationary feature detector is employed on this estimated signal to compute the cyclic features. Finally, the proposed algorithm uses the second order statistics, namely, the spectral correlation function (SCF), to classify each NB signal as a legitimate signal or a jamming signal. In the end, performance of the proposed algorithm is shown with the help of Monte-Carlo simulations under different empirical setups.",

      "abstract": "Wearable cameras allow users to record their daily activities from a user-centered (First Person Vision) perspective. Due to their favourable location, they frequently capture the hands of the user, and may thus represent a promising user-machine interaction tool for different applications. Existent First Person Vision, methods understand the hands as a background/foreground segmentation problem that ignores two important issues: (i) Each pixel is sequentially classified creating a long processing queue, (ii) Hands are not a single “skin-like” moving element but a pair of interacting entities (left-right hand). This paper proposes a GPU-accelerated implementation of a left right-hand segmentation algorithm. The GPU implementation exploits the nature of the pixel-by-pixel classification strategy. The left-right identification is carried out by following a competitive likelihood test based the position and the angle of the segmented pixels.",

      "abstract": "Classifying frames, or parts of them, is a common way of carrying out detection tasks in computer vision. However, frame by frame classification suffers from sudden significant variations in image texture, colour and luminosity, resulting in noise in the extracted features and consequently in the decisions taken. Support Vector Machines have been widely validated as powerful tools for frame by frame detection of non-separable datasets, but are extremely sensitive to these variations between adjacent frames, creating as consequence sudden flickering in the classification results. This work proposes a Dynamic Bayesian Network to smooth the classification results of Support Vector Machines (SVM) in detection tasks.

      "abstract": "Perceiving crowd emotions and understand the situation is vital to control the situations in surveillance applications. This paper introduces the evolution of methods for crowd emotion perception based on bio-inspired probabilistic models. The emotions have been perceived both in an offline and online manner from the crowd. We focus on the perception of emotion from crowd behavior and dynamics. The paper explains few probabilistic algorithms and compares these for detection of emotion of crowds and proposes a probabilistic modelling approach which is trained on data to perceive the emotions of the crowd in an area under surveillance. Emotions are defined as evolving dynamic patterns arising due to interaction of people in an environment with their relationships to the past interaction patterns. Camera sensors are used to track the motion of the individuals within a crowd scenario under observation. The data mining techniques are used to distinguish between different behaviors and events into positive and negative emotions. The results have been evaluated using simulated data from a proposed office environment.",

This paper proposes a new approach for vehicle/pedestrian object classification based on the learning of a static kNN classifier, a dynamic Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based classifier, and the definition of a fusion rule that combines the two outputs. The main novelty consists in the study of the dynamic aspects of the moving objects by analysing the trajectories of the features followed in the HOG-PCA feature space, instead of the classical trajectory study based on the frame coordinates. The complete hybrid system was tested on the VIRAT database and worked in real time, yielding up to 100% peak accuracy rate in the tested video sequences.",

A consensus algorithm is proposed that exchanges state information with dynamically randomly selected neighbors and, through this randomization, achieves almost sure convergence in some scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive algorithms, integrated in intelligent systems, represent an important innovation in designing interactive smart environments. More in details, Cognitive Systems have important applications in anomaly detection and management in advanced video surveillance. These algorithms mainly address the problem of modelling interactions and behaviours among the main entities in a scene. A bio-inspired structure is here proposed, which is able to encode and synthesize signals, not only for the description of single entities behaviours, but also for modelling cause–effect relationships between user actions and changes in environment configurations. Such models are stored within a memory (Autobiographical Memory) during a learning phase. Here the system operates an effective knowledge transfer from a human operator towards an automatic systems called Cognitive Surveillance Node (CSN), which is part of a complex cognitive JDL-based and bio-inspired architecture. After such a knowledge-transfer phase, learned representations can be used, at different levels, either to support human decisions, by detecting anomalous interaction models and thus compensating for human shortcomings, or, in an automatic decision scenario, to identify anomalous patterns and choose the best strategy to preserve stability of the entire system. Results are presented in a video surveillance scenario, where the CSN can observe two interacting entities consisting in a simulated crowd and a human operator. These can interact within a visual 3D simulator, where crowd behaviour is modelled by means of Social Forces. The way anomalies are detected and consequently handled is demonstrated, on synthetic and also on real video sequences, in both the user-support and automatic modes.",

We identified the relevance of targeting ingredients and found positive expected experiences with the system such as to prevent habitual waste-related behavior, awareness of in-home food availability, creativity in cooking, moments for surprises and spontaneity, coordination among a group of friends, education and connectedness. Possible reasons of not using the system are trust and the inconvenience of distance among users in a group that are suggested with a social recipe. From our findings, we specify design implications for the system and optimization functions aiming at the prevention of food waste at a collective level.",

      "abstract": "Wideband spectrum sensing is a challenging task due to the constraints of digital signal processing (DSP) unit using in extant wireless systems. Compressive sensing (CS) is a new paradigm in signal processing, chosen for sparse wideband spectrum estimation with compressive measurements, thus provides relief of high-speed DSP requirements of cognitive radio (CR) receivers. In CS, whole wideband spectrum is estimated to find an opportunity for a CR usage requiring significant computation as well as sensing time, hence shrinkage the achievable throughput of CRs. In this paper, a novel model based CR receiver wideband sensing unit is addressed where a significant portion of the wideband spectrum is approximated through compressive sensing rather than recovering the total wideband spectrum. This model necessitates lesser sensing time and lower computational burden to detect a signal and as a result a level up of throughput is obtained. As a result, the sensing time gain improves the achievable throughput of the CRs which reflects on the simulation results and testifies the effectiveness of the proposed model. Therefore, a reduction of computational complexity is addressed without interfering with the detection performances, evaluated after spectrum estimation of a preferred band of interest by means of a well-known energy detector.",

      "abstract": "Hand detection and segmentation methods stand as two of the most most prominent objectives in First Person Vision. Their popularity is mainly explained by the importance of a reliable detection and location of the hands to develop human-machine interfaces for emergent wearable cameras. Current developments have been focused on hand segmentation problems, implicitly assuming that hands are always in the field of view of the user. Existing methods are commonly presented with new datasets. However, given their implicit assumption, none of them ensure a proper composition of frames with and without hands, as the hand-detection problem requires. This paper presents a new dataset for hand-detection, carefully designed to guarantee a good balance between positive and negative frames, as well as challenging conditions such as illumination changes, hand occlusions and realistic locations. Additionally, this paper extends a state-of-the-art method using a dynamic filter to improve its detection rate. The improved performance is proposed as a baseline to be used with the dataset.",

Sensing technologies can enable real-time monitoring to provide activity recognition in order to support health and safety among the elderly who are living independently. However, most existing activity recognition systems are focused on using sensors for unidirectional monitoring of emergency cases in particular, fall detection. Motivated by the desire to utilize bidirectional activity recognition to improve connectedness between an ageing population and their caregivers, we describe our planned approach to investigate how the perception of a caregiver's activities by a senior citizen and vice versa can aid in improving social connectedness. To investigate this perception, activity states will be transformed into an information visualization into the caregiver's home and vice versa without overt communication from participants. Findings are expected to provide further insight on the extent to which perception of human activities increase social connectedness.",

Nevertheless, the understanding of the environment surrounding the wearer is a difficult task with many elements involved. In this work, a method for detecting and mapping the presence of people and crowds around the wearer is presented. Features extracted at the crowd level are used for building a robust representation that can handle the variations and occlusion of people’s visual characteristics inside a crowd. To this aim, convolutional neural networks have been exploited. Results demonstrate that this approach achieves a high accuracy on the recognition of crowds, as well as the possibility of a general interpretation of the context trough the classification of characteristics of the segmented background.",

      "abstract": "In the sprouting paradigm of interoperable radio networks, wideband spectrum sensing is a challenging task for analog-to-digital converters (ADC) incorporated at the prevailing wireless radio systems because of the necessities of high sampling rates functioning at or above Nyquist frequencies. In order to cope with current ADCs, compressive sampling (CS), a promising scheme in signal processing arena, can be employed to search for the spectrum holes in the sparse wideband signals which are then opportunistically used by the cognitive radios (CR). In CS, transform coding as well as measurement matrix selection is an essential tool and it plays a vital role in the acquisition of wideband signals which comes out with a few number of random measurements. In this paper, two types of transform coding (Discrete Cosine Transform, DCT and Discrete Walsh-Hadamard Transform, WHT) is analyzed in the context of sparse wideband estimation via a well-known CS approach e.g., l<inf>1</inf>-norm optimization problem which could be used for spectrum sensing in wideband CR. Through the engagement of those measurement matrices, detection performance, execution time to sense PU bands and achievable capacity are investigated and analyzed at a single CR node. Finally, WHT coded CS scheme has been proposed for the wideband CR spectrum sensing as the simulation results arrange for the validation of our choice.",

      "abstract": "Motion and depth perceptions allow, to the human visual system, of interpreting the object movements by surrounding environmental information processing. The cognitive science applied to computer vision field can be considered an important innovation in order to increase the detection and tracking performances. These tasks play a fundamental role for detecting and tracking of dim moving point targets in Infra-Red (IR) images, which are characterized by low levels of SNR. In such cases, by means of the paradigm of Track-Before-Detect (TBD) based detection algorithm, it is possible to distinguish the target from image background. This paper presents an innovative TBD based approach relies on interacting multiple target models, which is called Fusion Filters (FFs), for far objects in IR sequences. Specifically, through two different Kalman filters it is possible to estimate separately position and dimension of the target. By means of switching probabilistic models, the proposed framework infers on the different target motion percepts. Such a process permits to obtain the global state of the object by merging position with size estimates. The experimental results on real and simulated sequences demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

      "abstract": "Superpixel methods have become popular in recent years as they provide an efficient preprocessing tool for a manifold of computer vision applications. In this work, we propose a method based on a self-adapting and self-growing network, which is bred starting from two random initialization seeds in the image. Such a network, which is a modification of the Instantaneous Topological Map (ITM), is inspired to a Growing Neural Gas (GNG) and like many other self adapting tools employs a Hebbian learning framework. Key point in competitive learning is the definition of a suitable distance function, which we analyse in depth in this work. Distance is indeed the notion which allows to link unsupervised competitive learning with segmentation, where cluster formation reduces to node creation and adaptation within the exploration of a suitable multidimensional input space.",

      "abstract": "Detection of emotions of a crowd is a new research area, which has never, to our knowledge, been accounted for research in previous literature. A bio-inspired model for representation of emotional patterns in crowds has been demonstrated. Emotions have been defined as evolving patterns as part of a dynamic pattern of events. This model has been developed to detect emotions of a crowd based on the knowledge from a learned context, psychology and experience of people in crowd management. The emotions of multiple people making a crowd in any surveillance environment are estimated by sensors signals such as a camera and are being tracked and their behavior is modeled using bio-inspired dynamic model. The behavior changes correspond to changes in emotions. The proposed algorithm involves the probabilistic signal processing modelling techniques for analysis of different types of behavior, interaction detection and estimation of emotions. The emotions are recognized by the expectation of temporal occurrences of causal events modeled by Gaussian mixture model. The model has been evaluated using the simulated behavioral model of a crowd.",

      "abstract": "This work presents a study of detection performance of energy detector in relay-based multihop cooperative diversity networks operating over independent Rayleigh fading channels. In particular, upper bound average detection probability expressions are obtained for three scenarios: (i) multihop cooperative relay communication; (ii) multi-hop cooperative relay communication with direct link and maximum ratio combiner (MRC) at destination; and (iii) multi-hop cooperative relay communication with direct link and selection combiner (SC) at destination. Classical method of performance evaluation based on probability density function (PDF) of received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is used. Furthermore, an alternative series form representation of generalized Marcum-Q function is employed in order to simplify the ensuing mathematical derivations. Because the obtained detection probability expressions are in the form of infinite summation series, their respective truncation error bounds are also derived. In the end, analyses are validated with the help of simulations and several observations regarding the impact of different parameters on detector's performance are outlined. © 2014 M. O.

This may become a crucial problem, especially in low-SNR environments, where target characteristics are highly susceptible to corruption. In this paper, an extended target model, namely Interacting Multiple Model (IMM), applied to Track-Before-Detect (TBD) based detection algorithm, for far objects, in infrared (IR) sequences is presented. The approach can automatically adapts the kinematic parameter estimations, such as position and velocity, in accordance with the predictions as dimensions of the target change. A sub-par sensor can cause tracking problems. In particular, for a single object, noisy observations (i.e. fragmented measures) could be associated to different tracks. In order to avoid this problem, presented framework introduces a cooperative mechanism between Joint Probabilistic Data Association Filter (JPDAF) and IMM.

Emotions are defined as evolving quantities arising from the reaction to contextual situations in a set of dynamic pattern of events. These events depend on internal and external interaction states in an already mapped space. The emotions of multiple people constituting a crowd in any surveillance environment are estimated by their social and collective behaviors using sensor signals e.g., a camera, which captures and tracks their motion. The feature space is constructed based on local features to model the contextual situations and the different interactions corresponding to different emergent behaviors are modeled using bio-inspired dynamic model. The changes in emotions correspond to behavioral changes which are produced to regulate behaviors under different encountered situations. Proposed algorithm involves the probabilistic signal processing modelling techniques for analysis of different types of collective behaviors based on interactions among people and classification models to estimate emotions as positive or negative. The evaluations are performed on simulated data show the proposed algorithm effectively recognizes the emotions of the crowd under specific situations. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive radio (CR) promises to be a solution for the spectrum underutilization problems. However, security issues pertaining to cognitive radio technology are still an understudied topic. One of the prevailing such issues are intelligent radio frequency (RF) jamming attacks, where adversaries are able to exploit on-the-fly reconfigurability potentials and learning mechanisms of cognitive radios in order to devise and deploy advanced jamming tactics. In this paper, we use a game-theoretical approach to analyze jamming/anti-jamming behavior between cognitive radio systems. A non-zero-sum game with incomplete information on an opponent’s strategy and payoff is modelled as an extension of Markov decision process (MDP). Learning algorithms based on adaptive payoff play and fictitious play are considered. A combination of frequency hopping and power alteration is deployed as an anti-jamming scheme. A real-life software-defined radio (SDR) platform is used in order to perform measurements useful for quantifying the jamming impacts, as well as to infer relevant hardware-related properties. Results of these measurements are then used as parameters for the modelled jamming/anti-jamming game and are compared to the Nash equilibrium of the game. Simulation results indicate, among other, the benefit provided to the jammer when it is employed with the spectrum sensing algorithm in proactive frequency hopping and power alteration schemes.",

Recently, there is a lot of work being done to analyze the energy detectors in both diversity and cooperative relay networks. In this work, detection performance of energy detector is analyzed in a fixed-gain cooperative relay network with maximum-ratio combiner (MRC) at the destination. Upper and lower bounds on instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the relay path are used in this work to mathematically tract the analyses. Probability density function (PDF) is derived for these asymptotic instantaneous SNR bounds to obtain upper and lower bound expressions of average detection probability (P<inf>d</inf>) for the relay path transmission. Similarly, PDF is derived for the combined signal from direct and relay path at destination with MRC, which is then used to derive asymptotic bounds on average P<inf>d</inf> of the cooperative system. The derived upper and lower bounds are tight approximations of the exact average P<inf>d</inf> which is also validated through simulations. © 2014 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive Radio as a technological breakthrough and enabler for concepts such as Opportunistic Spectrum Access and Dynamic Spectrum Access has so far received significant attention from the research community from a theoretical standpoint. In this work, we build upon the theoretical foundation and present an implementation of a Software Defined Radio/Cognitive Radio platform, with the feature under particular interest being the so-called Smart Transmission Layer. Smart Transmission Layer is a feature developed within the currently ongoing nSHIELD project, whose goal is establishing new paradigms for Security, Privacy and Dependability (SPD) of the future embedded systems. The role of the SPD-driven Smart Transmission Layer is providing reliable and efficient communications in critical channel conditions by using adaptive and flexible algorithms for dynamically configuring and adapting various transmission-related parameters. The implementation was done on the test bed consisting of two Secure Wideband Multi-role - Single-Channel Handheld Radios (SWAVE HH) coupled with the powerful proprietary multi-processor embedded platforms, and the corresponding auxiliaries. Several case studies were performed, namely: remote control of the radios, analysis of the installed waveforms, interference detection, and spectrum sensing using a quasi-real-time energy detector. A roadmap towards the future implementation aspects using the test bed was set.",

      "abstract": "Extraction and representation of relevant information from large-scale surveillance systems constitute fundamental processes for allowing automatic interpretation of complex scenes. In particular, when the amount of information increases (i.e., due to a larger number of monitored areas), attention focusing techniques are needed to highlight most relevant parts within the overall acquired data. When wide area surveillance systems are considered, one of the major problems in event detections is the reconstruction of the scene as a whole, from spatially limited observations. In this paper, a novel representation technique for sparse information, based on information theory, is presented. Self Organizing Maps (SOMs) have been used for classifying and correlating observed sparse data time series. By means of Information Bottleneck theory, it is possible to determine the optimal data representation in the SOM-space as a tradeoff between the signal reconstruction capabilities and the original data statistical similarities preservation. Proposed experiments show how the so called information bottleneck-based SOM selection for knowledge modelling, can be applied to the field of crowd monitoring for people density map estimation and event detection. Results are presented on synthetic and real video sequences. © 2014 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Recently, a Bayesian estimator with a hybrid update was developed [1], based on a mathematical formulation of sampling. Such an Event Based State Estimator (EBSE) allows for a stable synchronous state estimate, relying on asynchronous measurements. Usefulness of such a filter comes with its approximate analytic formulation, which is attainable given a send-on-delta sampling strategy. We argue that such a formulation can be extended to cope with a failing detector in case the filter is used for tracking. The basic idea is to approach the issue as a package loss problem, where a missed target is assimilated to a lost package. More in detail, we propose that this approach can be exploited in video tracking, where faulty detectors are commonplace. We show how tracking performance with a poor pedestrian detector, failing to recognize its target, can improve with respect to standard Kalman filter. © 2014 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The emergence of new pervasive wearable technologies (e.g. action cameras and smart glasses) calls attention to the so called First Person Vision (FPV). In the future, more and more everyday-life videos will be shot from a first-person point of view, overturning the classical fixed-camera understanding of Vision, specializing the existing knowledge of moving cameras and bringing new challenges in the field of video processing. The trend in research is going to be oriented towards a new type of computer vision, centred on moving sensors and driven by the need for new applications for wearable devices. We identify hand tracking and gesture recognition as an essential topic in this field, motivated by the simple realization that we often look at our hand, even while performing the simplest tasks in everyday life. In addition, the next frontier in user interfaces are hands-free devices. In this work we argue that applications based on FPV may involve information fusion at various complexity and abstraction levels, ranging from pure image processing to inference over patterns. We address the lowest, by proposing a first investigation on hand detection from a first-person point of view sensor and some preliminary results obtained fusing colour and optic flow information. © 2013 ISIF ( Intl Society of Information Fusi.",

      "abstract": "In most recent Intelligent Video Surveillance systems, mechanisms to support human decisions are integrated in cognitive artificial processes. These algorithms mainly address the problem of extraction and modelling of relevant information from a sensor network. In crowd monitoring the main problem is to individuate specific events as for example different behaviours among interacting entities. A bio-inspired structure for modelling cause-effect relationships between events was lately proposed by the authors and applied to the field of automatic crowd monitoring. Such cause-effect relationships are modelled by means of coupled Event-based Dynamic Bayesian Networks and stored within an Autobiographical Memory during a learning phase, in order to supply appropriate knowledge to the automatic system in the on-line phase. However, the definition of causality relies on the selection of relevant events, which is performed by means of Self Organizing Maps and on a temporal scale defined by a newly introduced temporal parameter. Performances of the proposed multi-camera video surveillance system are studied on tuning such causality parameters. © 2013 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Radio spectrum is an expensive resource and only licensed users have the right to use it. In the emerging paradigm of interoperable radio networks, the unlicensed users are allowed to use the radio frequency that is unoccupied by the licensed users in temporal and spatial manner. To support this spectrum optimization functionality, the unlicensed users are required to sense the radio environment periodically for being aware of the high-priority licensed users. Wideband spectrum sensing is a challenging task for the present analog-to-digital converters used in wireless systems due to the constraints of digital signal processing unit. Exploiting on the sparseness of the wideband signal, the spectrum can be recovered with only few compressive measurements, consequently employs relief of high-speed signal processing units. This paper presents a novel wideband sensing approach where a significant portion of wideband spectrum is approximated via compressive sensing rather than entire wideband spectrum estimation, thus reducing computational complexity for the cognitive radios. Detection performances are evaluated through spectrum estimation of the desired frequency band by means of a well-known energy detection method. Finally, reduction of computational burden and memory spaces obligation are described compared to the conventional compressive sensing preceded over a single RF chain, without interfering with the detection performances. © 2013 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, performance of the energy detector is analyzed in blind cooperative relay networks operating over independent and identically distributed (IID) Rayleigh fading channels. First, utilizing the closed-form expression of the probability density function (PDF) of the dual-hop relay link along with an alternative series form representation of the generalized marcum-Q function, exact average detection probability expression is obtained for the dual-hop blind relay link. After that, a closed-form PDF expression is derived for the total received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the combined received signal, received via the relay path and direct path, at the destination, which is assumed to be equipped with selection combiner (SC) and energy detector. Finally, within the same analytical framework, as established for the analysis of the relay link, an exact average detection probability expression for the cooperative system is derived. Since the obtained expressions are in the form of infinite summation series, therefore, respective series truncation error bounds are also calculated, which can be used to compute the number of terms required to achieve a given figure of accuracy. In the end, analytical expressions are validated with the help of computer simulations. It is expected that these analysis will be helpful in quantifying the future communication networks such as cognitive radio networks. © 2013 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "While potentially solving the spectrum underutilization problem using methods such as dynamic and opportunistic spectrum access, Cognitive Radios (CRs) also bring a set of security issues and potential breaches that have to be addressed. These issues come from the two important capabilities implemented within CRs: their cognition ability and reconfigurability. This chapter focuses on identifying, presenting, and classifying the main potential security attacks and vulnerabilities, as well as proposing appropriate counter-measures and solutions for them. These are supplemented by simulation results and metrics, with the intention of estimating the efficiency of each of the observed attacks and its counter-measure. The presented simulations are performed in the proprietary C/C++ and Matlab/Simulink simulators. nSHIELD is a major ongoing European embedded systems security-related project, which is used to demonstrate the practicability of the potential implementation of the proposed countermeasures and solutions for the discussed security problems and issues.",

      "abstract": "Human behavior analysis for Cognitive Surveillance Systems (CSS) share mainly the concept that it can be time to extend functionalities beyond simple video analytics. In most recent systems addressed by research, automatic support to human decisions based on object detection, tracking and situation assessment tools is integrated as a part of a complete cognitive artificial process. In such cases a CSS needs to represent complex situations that describe alternative possible real time interactions between the dynamic observed situation and operators' actions. To obtain such knowledge, particular types of Event based Dynamic Bayesian Networks E-DBNs are here proposed. In this paper it is shown how, by means of Run Length Encoding (RLE) of off line acquired information, the cognitive system is able to represent and anticipate possible operators' actions within the CSS. Results are shown by considering a crowd monitoring application in a critical infrastructure. A system is presented where a CSS embedding in a structured way RLE E-DBN knowledge can interact with an active visual simulator of crowd situations. Outputs from such a simulator can be easily compared with video signals coming from real cameras and processed by typical Bayesian tracking methods. © 2013 EURASIP.",

      "abstract": "Visual tracking represents a fundamental processing step for most of the video analytics for surveillance applications where the aim is to automatically understand the action performed by the objects present in the monitored scene [1-3]. The basic tracking task consists in following a target frame by frame, labeling it, and estimating its trajectory. Although this problem has been widely investigated in the last decades, a solution is still to be found that is valid in general situations without defining tight constraints and assumptions mainly related to the complexity of the guarded scene in terms of number of moving objects and overlapping percentage between objects themselves with environmental obstacles. Crowded scenes in public unconstrained assets such as roads, railway stations, and airports represent a challenging scenario where state-of-the-art tracking algorithms are unable to correctly track each detected target. Therefore, more effective approaches (in terms of target detection and trajectory evaluation precision, object identity preservation, improved robustness to highly cluttered environments) are necessary to correctly perform the tracking task in these scenarios under different environmental conditions (e.g., light changes and nonstatic background). Moreover, research is also focusing on the development of trackers [4] able to enrich available track by including other features such as scale, pose, and shape in the object description with the aim of accomplishing advanced scene interpretation tasks. Furthermore, observation from trackers at different resolution levels can be useful to increase system performances and have a better understanding of the monitored scene.",

      "abstract": "Radio tactical scenarios are rapidly evolving and MANETs (Mobile Ad-hoc NETworks) are more and more frequently adopted because of their recognized advantages (absence of infrastructure, mobility management, traffic forwarding, etc.), also pushed by the rapid evolution of Software Defined Radio (SDR). The impact over network performances of fast and continuous topology changes due to nodes' mobility, together with other constrains (such as adverse e.m. propagation environment, available bandwidth, nodes' computational capacity and power consumption) is anyhow still one of the major issues to be faced in MANETs. Traditional routing protocols have been adapted in recent times to cope with the above mentioned constraints and in particular our attention was focused on the well-known and widely adopted Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol. This paper presents an improvement of the Quality of Service (QoS) features of the 'standard' OLSR protocol, in terms of packet loss and delay. The so-called 'Location Aware' OLSR protocol is based on the introduction of two concepts: the 'Perceived Coverage Radius' and 'Perceived Coverage Area'. In simple terms, the basic idea behind those concepts is to 'judiciously' exclude from the one-hop neighbor set of a node, those nodes which will presumably move out in a little time of the e.m. coverage area of the node. Benefits of the innovative method has been demonstrated and validated through simulations of typical tactical applications. © 2012 IEEE.",

The architecture presented in this article is based on the Cognitive Node (CN) - a module able to receive data from the sensors, process it in order to find potentially harmful or anomalous events and situations and, in some cases, to interact with the environment itself or contact the human operator. The cognitive model was studied and exploited, focusing on the analysis and decision blocks which represent the crucial phases for assessing potentially unsecure/unsafe events and/or situations. The scalability of the model with regards to different application domains was investigated during the research activity.

      "abstract": "Nowadays, cognitive radio is one of the most promising paradigms in the arena of wireless communications, as it aims at the proficient use of radio resources. Proper utilization of the radio spectrum requires dynamic spectrum accessing. To this end, spectrum sensing is undoubtedly necessary. In this chapter, various approaches for dynamic spectrum access scheme are presented, together with a survey of spectrum sensing methodologies for cognitive radio. Moreover, the challenges are analyzed that are associated with spectrum sensing and dynamic spectrum access techniques. Sensing beacon transmitted from different cognitive terminals creates significant interference to the primary users if proper precautions have not been taken into consideration. Consequently, cognitive radio transmitter power control are finally addressed to analyze energy efficiency aspects.",

      "abstract": "An algorithm for extending the Bayesian multiple target tracking framework to solve the extended visual object tracking problem using sparse features is proposed. In particular, the state space is divided into two sets: one modeling the global motion of the object and one modeling the movement of every feature point. This division allows one to obtain a factorized proposal distribution that, takes into account current measurements and exploits the structure of the problem, allowing an efficient exploration of the state space. The proposed method is demonstrated to be more accurate than the baseline algorithm while requiring lower processing time for the same performance. © 2011 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The problem faced in this work is related to tracking and recognition of rigid and non-rigid interacting objects in complex scenes from a static camera. The processing steps leading to the description of the behavior of objects in terms of trajectories and typology will be illustrated in details and the performances of the system will be discussed. The proposed approach uses an empty reference image for object extraction through image difference; the reference frame is updated continuously by a high level background updating module taking into account the detected objects and their classification tag. The tracking module is responsible for objects labelling being able to preserve objects identity even when an occlusion occurs on the image plane between different objects. A novel approach is considered for tracking and recognition, which is based on different features selection strategies applied to an initially redundant set of shape points (i.e. corners). Short-term and long-term memory models are used in a cooperative scheme. The two level feature selection strategy used by long-term shape models is described: at lower level a spatial-temporal voting method is used to assess temporal stability of spatial groups of corners; at the higher level, a supervised self-organizing scheme is used for objects classification. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Many solutions have been proposed to automatically detect a variety of events of interest. However, not all solutions and technologies may satisfy all the requirements of the surveillance scenario. For this reason, performance evaluation of existing event detection solutions becomes an important step in the deployment of video surveillance projects. In this paper, we propose a practical approach that aims at minimizing the ground truth generation problem and the expertise required to evaluate and compare the results by introducing specific requirements of specific event detection scenarios.. This approach is believed to be applicable for an initial evaluation of candidate solutions to a specific surveillance scenario before more exhaustive tests in an integrated environment. The proposed method is under evaluation in the framework of the Challenge of Real-time Event Detection Solutions (CREDS). © 2005 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "A novel integrated multi-camera video-sensor (panoramic scene analysis - PSA) system is proposed for surveillance applications. In the proposed set-up, an omnidirectional imaging device is used in conjunction with a pan tilt zoom (PTZ) camera leading to an innovative kind of sensor that is able to automatically track at a higher zoom level any moving object within the guarded area. In particular, the catadioptric sensor is calibrated and used in order to track every single moving object within its 360 degree field of view. Omnidirectional image portions are eventually rectified and pan, tilt and zoom parameters of the moving camera are automatically adjusted by the system in order to track detected objects. In addition a co-operative strategy was developed for the selection of the object to be tracked by the PTZ sensor in the case of multiple targets. © IEE, 2005.",

      "abstract": "This paper describes a cooperative distributed system for outdoor surveillance based on fixed and mobile cameras. In order to continuously monitor the entire scene, a fixed unidirectional sensor has been used, mounted on the roof of a building in front of the guarded area. To obtain higher resolution images of a particular region in the scene, an active pan-tilt-zoom camera has been used. The low resolution images are used to detect and locate moving objects in a scene. The estimated object position is used in order to evaluate pan-tilt movements that are necessary in order to focus the attention of the mobile-head camera on the considered object at a higher zoom level. The system is able to provide automatic change detection at multiple zoom levels. A video shot with a small zoom factor is used to monitor the entire scene from a fixed camera, while a medium and high zoom factor are used to improve interpretation of the scene. The use of a mobile camera allows one to exceed the limitations of the bounded field of view of the sensor imposed by a fixed camera. In this case it is not possible to provide a priori knowledge about the background of the scene. The proposed method for solving the non-fixed background problem for mobile cameras involves realization of a multilevel structure obtained by the acquisition of several images. The panoramic image of the whole scene is generated using a mosaicing technique. Both sensors are used to detect and estimate the precise location of a given object at different zoom levels in order to obtain a better position estimation The results presented in the paper show the validity of the proposed approach in terms ofprobabilities of false alarm and misdetection of the system and algorithms computational complexity and mean processing time. © 2002 Int.

      "abstract": "This paper shows a method for extending efficient algorithms for scene understanding already developed and tested for fixed cameras to a mobile camera environment. Real-time change detection methods for mobile-head cameras are introduced. The architecture of the system can be divided in two phases. During the off-line phase the system creates a panoramic multi-layer background image using a small number of static background images. In the on-line phase the system compares the acquired images with a portion of the panoramic background. Different approaches to produce the change detection images are analyzed. Experimental results are presented in order to validate the proposed methods; their evaluation is performed by using receiving operator characteristic (ROC) curves. The Neyman-Pearson statistical criterion has been used for selecting of optimal change detection threshold. The presented results, in terms of probabilities of false and correct detection rates and real-time behavior, show that one of the studied methods can be used as the basis for higher level modules of an automatic video-surveillance system. © 2002 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a system for automatic videosurveillance applications. The system has been designed to monitor outdoor environments such as car parks or streets, providing the human operator with a symbolic description of the scene. The final task of the architecture is to automatically provide alarms when specific events of interest are detected. In this way the level of automation of the system is increased as well as overall performances. One of the main drawback of traditional video surveillance systems lies in the alarm generation. This task has to be visually performed by the human operators with intrinsic limitation. The possibility of having this process automated is here described within the design of an architecture capable of acquire, process and successfully store data coming from one or more sensors.",

The proposed approach uses an empty reference image for object extraction through image difference; the reference frame is updated continuously by a background updating module taking into account the detected objects. The tracking module is responsible for objects labeling being able to preserve objects identity even when an overlapping occurs on the image plane between different objects. A shape matching technique is used that is based on a linear Kalman filter.

The application concerns outdoor people counting for tourist-flow estimation in a constrained environment. The technical problems to be solved are concerned with: (a) the design and implementation of low-complexity background updating and change detection algorithms able to adapt themselves to the time-varying illumination scene conditions, and (b) the integration of real-time pattern-recognition tools in order to distinguish group of persons to be counted from other objects present in the scene.

      "abstract": "In the past few years, the development of complex surveillance systems has captured the interest of both the research and industrial worlds. Strong and challenging requirements of modern society are involved in this problem, which aims to increase safety and security in several application domains such as transport, tourism, home and bank security, military applications, etc. At the same time, fast improvements in microelectronics, telecommunications, and computer science make it necessary to consider new perspectives in this field. The main objective of this paper is to investigate, discuss, and evaluate the impact of distributed processing and new communication techniques on multimedia surveillance systems, which represent the so-called third-generation surveillance systems (3GSSs). In particular, aspects related to the distribution of intelligence among multiple-processing and wide-bandwidth resources are discussed in detail. It is shown how distribution of intelligence can be obtained by a hierarchical architecture that partitions, in a dynamic way, the main logical processing tasks (i.e., representation, recognition, and communication) performed in a 3GSS physical architecture made up of intelligent cameras, hubs, and central control rooms. The advantages of this solution are pointed out in terms of: 1) increased flexibility and reconfigurability and 2) optimal allocation of available processing and bandwidth resources. Finally, a case study is analyzed that allows one to gain a deeper insight into a distributed surveillance system. © 2001 IEEE.",

The proposed method can be considered as basis for a low level image processing stage in a advanced video-surveillance system. The main feature of the algorithm is the robustness to the illumination changes in the scene: this robustness is achieved by using a background updating module working in cooperation with the change detection algorithm. The background updating method works in a different way according to speed of illumination changes. If a sudden illumination change is detected the background is heavily updated while if a slow lightning variation occurs, a continuous soft updating module is used to take into account the long-term slow illumination changes. Experimental results of an automatic people counting system including the proposed low level image processing stage indicate that the method detects changes accurately in case of time-varying illumination.",
