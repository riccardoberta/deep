      "abstract": "Recently, a method has been proposed that, by performing a principal component analysis (PCA) of the noise spectra recorded near an offshore wind turbine, followed by a supervised regression procedure, computes the prediction of the noise power spectral density as wind speed changes. This article addresses two problems of practical importance that the above method fails to adequately solve. In the former, the operating condition of the turbine is defined by the combination of wind speed and rotational speed. The spectra available are few and are recorded during sea campaigns in which operating conditions occur with different probabilities. As a result, the data set is highly unbalanced. In the second, the noise spectrum near a given turbine is predicted on the basis of numerous balanced recordings taken near a second turbine, nominally identical. To enhance the prediction, very few unbalanced recordings taken near the first turbine are available. Here, an original method is proposed that combines weighted PCA, where different importance is given to the recorded spectra, with a regularized technique to estimate the scores that finally combine the PCA results. A wide range of metrics (both general and focused on harmonics or on performance variation with respect to operating condition) is also adopted to assess the similarity between the predicted and actual spectra, thanks to which the advantage of the proposed method in solving the two problems is demonstrated.",

      "abstract": "The study of the impact on the marine ecosystem of an offshore wind farm benefits from the knowledge of the underwater noise observed at a single turbine, as the wind speed varies. The calculation of the noise spectral average at a given wind speed requires many recordings, each acquired in a limited time interval: an extremely time-consuming process. This study investigated how to approach the spectral average using only very few noise recordings for each wind speed, leveraging supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques. Three different prediction methods, based on mean and interpolation, principal component analysis (PCA), and nonnegative matrix factorization, in combination with four techniques for coefficient estimation as the wind varies, are tested. Prediction based on principal component analysis, combined with Gaussian process regression, outperforms other methods in all three case studies considered. The latter, in addition to the problem described above, include the prediction of the noise spectrum: at wind speeds where no noise recordings are available, and using a few recordings acquired at another (nominally identical) wind turbine.",

      "abstract": "Computational models of collective motion successfully reproduce the most common behaviours of a school of fish, using only a few elementary interactions between individuals. However, their ability to also reproduce individual behaviours that are discordant from those of the group has not yet been adequately investigated. In this paper, a self-propelled particle model using three interaction zones is considered in relation to the counter-rotation of an individual: a phenomenon observable in real schools of fish milling in a torus, when an individual moves in the same torus but in the opposite direction for a certain period of time. This study shows that the interactions of repulsion, orientation and attraction between individuals moving at constant speed in a three-dimensional space, with asynchronous updating, can generate temporary counter-rotations. The analysis of such events sheds light on the mechanisms that start the counter-rotation and those that end it. Although the contribution of the repulsion interaction is often significant to start and terminate the counter-rotation, it does not prove to be decisive. Indeed, it is observed that even when interactions between individuals are limited to attraction alone, temporary counter-rotations of individuals occur, provided the fish density along the circumference is not uniform. Some of these conclusions, deduced from the simulations performed, are visually consistent with what is observed in some underwater video recordings of milling schools of fish.",

      "abstract": "While in the past the prediction of wind and rainfall from underwater noise was performed using empirical equations fed with very few spectral bins and fitted to the data, it has recently been shown that regression performed using supervised machine learning techniques can benefit from the simultaneous use of all spectral bins, at the cost of increased complexity. However, both empirical equations and machine learning regressors perform the prediction using only the acoustic information collected at the time when one wants to know the wind speed or the rainfall intensity. At most, averages are made between spectra measured at subsequent times (spectral compounding) or between predictions obtained at subsequent times (prediction compounding). In this article, it is proposed to exploit the temporal correlation inherent in the phenomena being predicted, as has already been done in methods that forecast wind and rainfall from their values (and sometimes those of other meteorological quantities) in the recent past. A special architecture of recurrent neural networks, the long short-term memory, is used along with a data set composed of about 16 months of underwater noise measurements (acquired every 10 min, simultaneously with wind and rain measurements above the sea surface) to demonstrate that the introduction of temporal correlation brings significant advantages, improving the accuracy and reducing the problems met in the widely adopted memoryless prediction performed by random forest regression. Working with samples acquired at 10-min intervals, the best performance is obtained by including three noise spectra for wind prediction and six spectra for rainfall prediction.",

      "abstract": "Wind speed and its evolution over time and space are important for many purposes, particularly for climate studies. However, direct measurement at the ocean surface is problematic, and remote prediction using satellite and radar systems rarely offers the desired resolution or accuracy, especially in polar waters. Being able to predict wind speed from underwater acoustic noise is, therefore, a key aspect to improving climate models and monitoring systems. To date, empirical equations using the noise spectrum at a given frequency, fitted to the available data, have been adopted. To leverage on the whole noise spectrum, only recently supervised machine-learning regression has been proposed. This article exploits the concurrent acquisition of underwater noise and anemometer measurements over a period of 16 months, at 10-min steps, to demonstrate the superiority of regression models based on supervised learning over empirical equations. It is also shown that depending on the type of compounding implemented, different tradeoffs are achieved between accuracy and temporal resolution. Considering all samples in the data set, including those in which rainfall and passing ships occurred, and separating by cross-validation the samples used for training from those used for testing, it is shown that a regressor based on the random forest technique, followed by the compounding of the predictions over an interval of 1 h, provides a mean absolute error of 0.62 m/s and a correlation coefficient of 0.96. In addition, the robustness with respect to the parameter setting and the performance obtained in performing prediction in chronological order are evaluated.",

      "abstract": "Innovative membrane filtration plants for municipal wastewaters are being developed and need the support of reliable filtration models in the designing phase. In the past, semi-empirical filtration models for membrane processes have been proposed. At present, the most prominent works point out the importance of particle poly-dispersity in the development of reliable models but fail into the implementation of probability density functions (PDFs) capable of an accurate fitting of the experimental particle size distribution (PSD). We report the experimental PSDs of two different municipal wastewater samples, obtained through the laser diffraction technique. The experimental results show that the laser diffraction technique can characterize wastewater particle dimensions both in the colloidal and supra-colloidal regions. The experimental study is complemented by a comparative analysis in which many PDFs are used to fit the experimental PSDs through a least-squares approach. Some of these PDFs are proposed here for the first time to fit experimental wastewater PSDs. Among the PDFs considered for the statistical modeling, the three-parameter lognormal and the Burr PDFs are demonstrated to provide satisfactory fitting, whereas the other considered functions fail. This result is confirmed by the analysis of both the available wastewater samples.",

      "abstract": "More and more biologists and bioinformaticians turn to machine learning to analyze large amounts of data. In this context, it is crucial to understand which is the most suitable data analysis pipeline for achieving reliable results. This process may be challenging, due to a variety of factors, the most crucial ones being the data type and the general goal of the analysis (e.g., explorative or predictive). Life science data sets require further consideration as they often contain measures with a low signal-To-noise ratio, high-dimensional observations, and relatively few samples. In this complex setting, regularization, which can be defined as the introduction of additional information to solve an ill-posed problem, is the tool of choice to obtain robust models. Different regularization practices may be used depending both on characteristics of the data and of the question asked, and different choices may lead to different results. In this article, we provide a comprehensive description of the impact and importance of regularization techniques in life science studies. In particular, we provide an intuition of what regularization is and of the different ways it can be implemented and exploited. We propose four general life sciences problems in which regularization is fundamental and should be exploited for robustness. For each of these large families of problems, we enumerate different techniques as well as examples and case studies. Lastly, we provide a unified view of how to approach each data type with various regularization techniques.",

      "abstract": "Superdirective arrays have been extensively studied because of their considerable potential accompanied, unfortunately, by a high sensitivity to random errors that affect the responses and positions of array elements. However, the statistics of their actual beam pattern (BP) has never been systematically investigated. This paper shows that the Rician probability density function (PDF), sometimes adopted to study the impact of errors in conventional arrays, is a valid approximation for superdirective BP statistics only where some mathematical terms are negligible. The paper also shows that this is the case for all linear end-fire arrays considered. A similar study is proposed concerning the correlation between BP lobes, showing that for the superdirective arrays considered the lobes, especially non-adjacent ones, are almost independent. Furthermore, knowledge of the PDF of the actual BP allows one to define quantile BP functions, whose probability of being exceeded, at any point, is fixed. Combining the lobes' independence with quantile BP functions, an empirical equation for the probability that the entire actual BP will not exceed a quantile function over an interval larger than a given size is obtained. This new knowledge and these tools make it possible to devise new methods to design robust superdirective arrays via optimization goals with clearer and more relevant statistical meaning.",

      "abstract": "Underwater noise analysis allows estimation of parameters of meteorological interest, difficult to monitor with in situ devices, especially in very harsh environments such as polar waters. Rainfall detection is a fundamental step of acoustical meteorology toward quantifying precipitation and, indirectly, wind. To date, this task has been conducted with some success by using a few frequency bins of the noise spectrum and combining their absolute values and slopes into some inequalities. Unfortunately, these algorithms do not perform well when applied to spectra obtained by averaging multiple noise recordings made over the course of an hour. Supervised, machine learning models allow the use of all the frequency bins in the spectrum, exploiting relationships that are difficult for a human observer to identify. Among the different models tested, a binary classifier based on random forest performed well with moderate computational load. Using a dataset consisting of over 18 000 hourly averaged spectra (approximately 25 months of in situ recordings) and comparing the results with measurements from a surface-mounted rain gauge, the proposed system detects precipitations greater than 1 mm/h with 90% probability, keeping the false alarm probability below 0.5%. This system has demonstrated remarkable robustness as performance is achieved without intentionally excluding any spectra corrupted by sounds produced by other sources, such as naval traffic and wind blowing over the sea surface.",

      "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3-D) ultrasound medical imaging provides advantages over a traditional 2-D visualization method. However, the use of a 2-D array to acquire 3-D images may result in a transducer composed of thousands of elements and a large amount of data in the front-end, making it impractical to implement high volume rate imaging and individually control all elements with the scanner. This paper proposes an original approach, valid for wideband operations centered on the design center frequency, to maintain a limited number of active elements and firing events, while preserving high resolution and volume rate. A 7 MHz 2-D array is composed of two circular concentric subparts. In the inner footprint the elements are distributed following a regular grid, while in the outer subpart a sparse non-grid solution is adopted. The inner circular dense array is composed of 256 elements with a pitch of 0.5λ. The overall footprint, delimited by the outer subpart, is equivalent to a 256-element array with a pitch of 1.5λ. All the elements of the inner subpart are activated in transmission. Following an optimization procedure, both subparts, including a subset of the elements placed in the inner footprint (i.e., sparse on-the-grid array) and the elements spread over the outer subpart (i.e., sparse off-the-grid array) are used to receive. A total number of 256 elements, defined by the sum of elements distributed in the inner and outer subparts, is fixed in reception. The proposed approach implies a multiline reception strategy, where for each transmission 3 × 3 firing events occur in reception. The sparse receive array is optimized by using a simulated annealing optimization. An original cost function is designed specifically to achieve successful results in wideband conditions. The receive array is optimized in order to obtain consistent results for different signal bandwidths of the excitation pulse. For all the desired bandwidths, the optimized array will provide the recovery of the lower lateral resolution of the transmission phase and, at the same time, a significant reduction of the undesired side lobe raised in the 3-D two-way beam pattern. The 3-D two-way beam pattern analysis reveals that the proposed solution is able to guarantee a lateral resolution of 1.35 mm at a focus depth of 25 mm for the three fractional signal bandwidths of interest (i.e., 30%, 50% and 70%) considered in the optimization process. The undesired side lobes are successfully suppressed especially when, as a consequence of the multiline strategy, non-coincident steering angles are used in transmission and reception. Moreover, thanks to the firing scheme adopted, a high-volume rate of 63 volumes per second may be achieved at the focus depth. The volume rate decreases to 32 volumes per second at twice the focal depth. Phantom image simulations show that the proposed method maintains a satisfactory and almost uniform image quality in terms of resolution and contrast for all the signal bandwidths of interest.",

      "abstract": "Frequency-invariant beam patterns are often required by systems using an array of sensors to process broadband signals. In some experimental conditions (small devices for underwater acoustic communication), the array spatial aperture is shorter than the involved wavelengths. In these conditions, superdirective beamforming is essential for an efficient system. We present a comparison between two methods that deal with a data-independent beamformer based on a filter-and-sum structure. Both methods (the first one numerical, the second one analytic) formulate a mathematical convex minimization problem, in which the variables to be optimized are the filters coefficients or frequency responses. The goal of the optimization is to obtain a frequency invariant superdirective beamforming with a tunable tradeoff between directivity and frequency-invariance. We compare pros and cons of both methods measured through quantitative metrics to wrap up conclusions and further proposed investigations.",

Despite the supervised classifier used in a data-driven system is trained by samples gathered under one specific design-point operating condition, during real operation the plant can move to a new, unexpected off-design operating condition, reducing the performance of the diagnosis system. This Short Communication demonstrates that this reduction is heavily mitigated if the supervised classifier is adapted to the new condition through the domain adaptation statistical technique. The present study shows that a probability of correct classification between 85% and 94% can be achieved in off-design, when a probability of 95% is obtained at the design-point.",

      "abstract": "The development of fault diagnosis systems able to early detect and identify any malfunctioning is of great importance towards the diffusion of energy conversion plants based on solid oxide fuel cells. Because the traditional model-based schemes for the diagnosis demonstrated a poor fault identification capability (especially when many operating conditions and fault sizes are combined), hybrid schemes were proposed that, incorporating pattern recognition classifiers, achieved significant performance improvements. However, like in the model-based case, the hybrid schemes require the running of the plant model in parallel to the real plant functioning. In this study, a data-driven fault diagnosis scheme is presented, in which the plant model is used only off-line, for the training of the classifier. Both support vector machine and random forest classifiers are proposed and tested. It is demonstrated that, when a support vector machine classifier is deployed, the data-driven system outperforms the hybrid systems in both fault detection and fault identification. High-level performance is achieved despite the large number of combinations among working conditions and fault sizes used for testing the system.",

The potential beneficiaries of this technology are primarily older users with partial vision and/or hearing loss. For people with low vision, the glasses offer an object recognition functionality based on a collaborative principle: the user provides information on an object category of interest with an audio command, the system then performs object-instance recognition and delivers an audio feedback, if any, to the user. As for the hearing loss impairment, the system provides a complementary input audio source to existing acoustic prostheses: the device enhances the speech only if it comes from a sound source in front of the person wearing the glasses. The technology helps to solve the so-called cocktail party problem.We present an experimental evaluation of the functionalities involving users with low vision or partial hearing loss. The outcome of this analysis reveals the appropriateness of our approaches from both the standpoint of the performance, and of the acceptance and the pleasantness of the users.",

      "abstract": "A novel method is proposed for generic target tracking by audio measurements from a microphone array. To cope with noisy environments characterized by persistent and high energy interfering sources, a classification map (CM) based on spectral signatures is calculated by means of a machine learning algorithm. Next, the CM is combined with the acoustic map, describing the spatial distribution of sound energy, in order to obtain a cleaned joint map in which contributions from the disturbing sources are removed. A likelihood function is derived from this map and fed to a particle filter yielding the target location estimation on the acoustic image. The method is tested on two real environments, addressing both speaker and vehicle tracking. The comparison with a couple of trackers, relying on the acoustic map only, shows a sharp improvement in performance, paving the way to the application of audio tracking in real challenging environments.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a method to reconstruct the 3D structure of generic convex rooms from sound signals. Differently from most of the previous approaches, the method is fully uncalibrated in the sense that no knowledge about the microphones and sources position is needed. Moreover, we demonstrate that it is possible to bypass the well known echo labelling problem, allowing to reconstruct the room shape in a reasonable computation time without the need of additional hypotheses on the echoes order of arrival. Finally, the method is intrinsically robust to outliers and missing data in the echoes detection, allowing to work also in low SNR conditions. The proposed pipeline formalizes the problem in different steps such as TOA estimation, microphones and sources localization and walls estimation. After providing a solution to these different problems, we present a global optimization approach that links together all the problems in a single optimization function. The accuracy and robustness of the method is assessed on a wide set of simulated setups and in a challenging real scenario. Compared to previous approaches, the method shows relevant improvements in terms of precision and scalability. Moreover, we make freely available for a challenging dataset for 3D room reconstruction with accurate ground truth in a real scenario.",

      "abstract": "Diagnostics and prognostics of natural gas steam reforming (NGSR) reactors are of utmost importance for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) systems, where a fuel processor fault can cause damage to the SOFC stack. Most common faults are due to carbon deposition. We investigate this phenomenon through a model based on microscopic mass, energy and momentum balances of a tubular NGSR reactor. The model includes a detailed local reaction kinetics specific for Ni-based catalysts, and is integrated numerically using a finite element method (FEM) implemented through COMSOL Multiphysics 5.2. Results obtained from the simulation of a laboratory scale reactor are validated on the basis of literature data. Furthermore, the model is applied to an NGSR fuel processor designed for an 1.1 kW SOFC system. The model allows to identify the area where carbon deposition is expected to occur, which is a key feature in view of developing specific diagnostic and prognostic tools. The simulation results demonstrate that safety criteria based on the feedstock steam to carbon (S/C) ratio can be misleading in a number of operating conditions.",

      "abstract": "A growing attention has been recently devoted to the impact of the underwater noise field generated by shipping activities on the marine fauna. A key aspect for the quantification of such impact is a proper model of the source levels radiated from the vessels. At a first level of approximation, simplified formulations based on a small number of macroparameters describing the ship characteristics are needed to quantify the emission and, accordingly, assess the noise impact and evaluate strategies for its control. In fact, a few models of this kind are available in the literature, mainly based on measurements and databases developed for military purposes. Most of these models have been tuned on old ships: this poses the question whether they are still applicable to modern commercial vessels. In this work, spectra of a series of measurements of underwater noise emitted by commercial vessels measured in the framework of two EU FP7 projects (SILENV: www.silenv.eu and AQUO: www.aquo.eu) are analyzed and compared with the results obtained applying the available literature models. The analysis is carried out for noise emitted both at design and off-design conditions. In such conditions, the models are also compared with a proposed spectral parametrization. Focusing on the off-design conditions, a detailed narrow band analysis of a complete set of noise spectra is presented for a ship equipped with a controllable pitch propeller (CPP). The spectral peculiarities of such a propulsion plant, when operated at constant revolutions per minute (RPM) are highlighted. Results of the suggested parametrization applied to the same ship are presented together with the data of other CPP ships and a critical analysis is carried out discussing the limits of the existing predictive models.",

      "abstract": "The success of distributed power generation by plants based on solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) is hindered by reliability problems that can be mitigated through an effective fault detection and isolation (FDI) system. However, the numerous operating conditions under which such plants can operate and the random size of the possible faults make identifying damaged plant components starting from the physical variables measured in the plant very difficult. In this context, we assess two classical FDI strategies (model-based with fault signature matrix and data-driven with statistical classification) and the combination of them. For this assessment, a quantitative model of the SOFC-based plant, which is able to simulate regular and faulty conditions, is used. Moreover, a hybrid approach based on the random forest (RF) classification method is introduced to address the discrimination of regular and faulty situations due to its practical advantages. Working with a common dataset, the FDI performances obtained using the aforementioned strategies, with different sets of monitored variables, are observed and compared. We conclude that the hybrid FDI strategy, realized by combining a model-based scheme with a statistical classifier, outperforms the other strategies. In addition, the inclusion of two physical variables that should be measured inside the SOFCs can significantly improve the FDI performance, despite the actual difficulty in performing such measurements.",

      "abstract": "Dual-mode contrast agents (CAs) have great potential for improving diagnostics. However, the effectiveness of CAs is strictly related to both the solution adopted to merge the two agents into a single probe unit, and the ratio between the two agents. In this study, two dual-mode CAs for simultaneous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound imaging (UI) were assessed. For this purpose, different densities of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) were anchored to the external surface of polymer-shelled microbubbles (MBs) or were physically entrapped into the shell. In vitro static and dynamic experiments were carried out with a limited concentration of modified MBs (106 bubbles ml−1) by avoiding destruction during UI (performed at a peak pressure lower than 320 kPa) and by using a lowfield MRI system (with a magnetic flux density equal to 0.25 T). Under these conditions, different imaging techniques, set-up parameters and SPION densities were used to achieve satisfactory detection of the CAs by using both UI and MRI. However, when the SPION density was increased, the MRI contrast improved, whereas the UI contrast worsened due to the reduced elasticity of the MB shell. For both UI and MRI, MBs with externally anchored SPIONs provided better performance than MBs with SPIONs entrapped into the shell. In particular, a SPION density of 29% with respect to the mass of the MBs was successfully tested.",

      "abstract": "Contrast-enhanced ultrasound with targeted microbubble contrast agents is an emerging technique for imaging biological processes at the molecular level. The accumulation of targeted microbubbles at tissue sites overexpressing specific molecular markers increases the backscattered signal for noninvasive evaluations of diseases. The aim of this preliminary study was to combine molecular imaging with an in vivo contrast agent quantification to support the early diagnosis of the pathology and to enhance the assessment of neoplastic tissues. Tumor growth was induced by subcutaneous injection of prostate cancer cells in four rats. Microbubbles targeted to tissue factor (TF) were administered. A vascularized region located in proximity to the tumor and centered around the focus depth was analyzed in each animal. The backscattered signals (i.e. the radio-frequency data) were acquired during two different perfusion conditions to evaluate the contribution of attached microbubbles. After image generation by means of a multi-pulse contrast-enhanced technique, a nonlinear regression method based on the support vector machine was employed to estimate the contrast agent concentrations in cubic voxels (1-mm side length). The number of attached microbubbles per mm<sup>3</sup> was estimated based on a multi-dimensional vector of features extracted from the processed radio-frequency signals. A significant correlation (p < 0.05) between the size of the tumors and the estimated microbubble concentration was found, thus opening the possibility for combining molecular imaging and contrast agent concentration mapping to refine pathology evaluation.

      "abstract": "Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are a promising option for power generation plants, but the design of fault diagnosis methods remains a key challenge. We propose the use of a quantitative model for such a plant (validated by real experiments) with a support vector machine (SVM) to detect and classify possible faults. The adoption of a classification approach as an identification strategy in a model-based fault diagnosis process represents a major innovation in the field of SOFC plants. Constant-voltage and constant-current control strategies are investigated. In both cases, an adequately trained SVM classifier is used to provide a high probability of correct classification when the plant functions at different steady-state operating conditions for random sizes of the considered faults and for realistic magnitudes of the errors affecting the model predictions. In addition, the relative importance of the easy-to-measure residuals, which are used as features in the SVM classification process, are discussed based on an advanced feature selection technique.",

      "abstract": "Despite surveillance systems becoming increasingly ubiquitous in our living environment, automated surveillance, currently based on video sensory modality and machine intelligence, lacks most of the time the robustness and reliability required in several real applications. To tackle this issue, audio sensory devices have been incorporated, both alone or in combination with video, giving birth in the past decade, to a considerable amount of research. In this article, audio-based automated surveillance methods are organized into a comprehensive survey: A general taxonomy, inspired by the more widespread video surveillance field, is proposed to systematically describe the methods covering background subtraction, event classification, object tracking, and situation analysis. For each of these tasks, all the significant works are reviewed, detailing their pros and cons and the context for which they have been proposed. Moreover, a specific section is devoted to audio features, discussing their expressiveness and their employment in the above-described tasks. Differing from other surveys on audio processing and analysis, the present one is specifically targeted to automated surveillance, highlighting the target applications of each described method and providing the reader with a systematic and schematic view useful for retrieving the most suited algorithms for each specific requirement.",

      "abstract": "Audio imaging can play a fundamental role in computer vision, in particular in automated surveillance, boosting the accuracy of current systems based on standard optical cameras. We present here a new hybrid device for acoustic-optic imaging, whose characteristics are tailored to automated surveillance. In particular, the device allows realtime, high frame rate generation of an acoustic map, overlaid over a standard optical image using a geometric calibration of audio and video streams. We demonstrate the potentialities of the device for target tracking on three challenging setup showing the advantages of using acoustic images against baseline algorithms on image tracking. In particular, the proposed approach is able to overcome, often dramatically, visual tracking with state-of-art algorithms, dealing efficiently with occlusions, abrupt variations in visual appearence and camouflage. These results pave the way to a widespread use of acoustic imaging in application scenarios such as in surveillance and security.",

      "abstract": "A statistical analysis of noise can play an important role in evaluating the performances of an acoustic system working underwater. If the system is either placed on board a vessel or operates nearby passing ships, the noise radiated by the vessel can considerably reduce the performances of the system if it has been not designed to have enough robustness. In the paper, a statistical analysis of ship noise records measured at sea is presented. Noise data were recorded in the framework of the EU FP7 European project AQUO (Achieve QUieter Oceans by shipping noise footprint reduction). Aim of the analysis is to characterize the ship noise in terms of probability distributions and their high-order moments. Since the overall ship noise is known to be generated by a number of sources with peculiar spectral energy distributions, the vessel spectrum can change considerably with a variation in the operating conditions. This approach allows determining the dependence of ship noise statistical properties on the actual navigation condition. In addition, since the ship noise records were simultaneously recorded by a vertical array of three hydrophones, a further analysis has been carried out to determine the effect of the receiver depth, and, accordingly, of the propagation path, in the recorded signal.",

The design of planar arrays with a limited number of active elements yielding real-time 3D high-quality imaging, for all beam scanning orientations, is one of the current challenges. In this paper, an innovative transmission/reception solution, that involves a compact fully sampled 256-element array as transmitter and an optimized 256-element sparse array as receiver, able to fulfill all the previous requirements, is proposed. The sparse array is made up of a thinned version of the transmitter dense array (i.e., a proper subset of elements is used both to transmit and receive) surrounded by an annular sparse off-the-grid array. Both the positions and the weights of the sparse array are jointly optimized by minimizing a novel cost function by means of simulated annealing algorithm. The proposed solution is well-suited for real-time 3D imaging over 360° of azimuth and ±40° of inclination.",

      "abstract": "This chapter is focused on the development of pattern recognition methodologies for the application to fuel cells (FCs). FC technology currently represents a remarkable opportunity for distributed and vehicular electric generation. However, FCs may be subject to various types of fault. The fault diagnosis systems proposed so far generally apply the model-based scheme, and identify fault types through case-specific inference approaches that use heuristic ad hoc tree classifiers and binarized residuals (i.e., differences between measured and predicted physical variables). Here, we demonstrate that high detection accuracy is achieved if the binarization of the residuals is avoided and suitable kernel-based learning techniques are applied instead of these heuristic inference approaches. This strategy enables accurate fault discrimination when the plant functions at different steady-state operating conditions, the sizes of the considered faults take on arbitrary values in large ranges, and model prediction errors of realistic magnitudes are considered. The results obtained using a support vector machine, combining it with a joint feature and model selection technique, and deploying a quantitative model for a laboratory-scale solid oxide FC generation plant support this conclusion.",

      "abstract": "The imaging of underwater acoustic sources using passive 3-D sonar systems has many potential applications. However, to achieve both wide bandwidth and low cost, an array that is superdirective at low frequencies and aperiodic, to avoid aliasing at high frequencies, is required. To design a sparse array layout and the related filter-and-sum beamformer, a recently proposed method for airborne acoustic cameras is applied. First, the method is generalized to include position errors. Next, the method is used to demonstrate that 49 low-cost, poorly matched hydrophones are sufficient to create a square array for an underwater acoustic camera working from 500 Hz to 8.75 kHz with a side length of 1 m. Finally, the images of a simulated acoustic scenario obtained using different passive systems are compared, which reveals the advantages of the proposed design strategy.",

The noise measurements were performed at sea for three different ship's types. Each ship passage was characterized by a specific combination of propeller rotational speed and propeller pitch, allowing to investigate the variations of the radiated noise spectrum at different settings of the pitch-RPM combination law. Neglecting the low-frequency contributions, the focus is on the analysis of the broadband patterns in the range 100 Hz to 4 kHz A parameterization derived from a basic spectral pattern is adopted: the noise spectrum shape is approximated with a flat level magnitude up to a reasonable frequency followed by a logarithmic decay. An investigation of the relationship between the considered parameters and the actual ship condition is proposed along with a comparison with the predictions provided by classic Ross and Whales-Heitmeyer ship noise models.",

This paper focuses on the opportunity of exploiting the echoes produced by targeted contrast agents to remotely estimate the volumetric concentration in a desired resolution cell. Tumor growth was induced by subcutaneous injection of prostate cancer cells in mice. A contrast-enhanced specific technique was used to image the region of interest subdivided in resolution cells of 1 mm-side. Radio frequency data were acquired for off-line processing. A method based on the support vector machine was employed to estimate the contrast agent concentration in each resolution cell. The preliminary in vivo experiments demonstrated a correlation between the extent of the primary tumor and the estimated concentrations. The combination of molecular imaging and contrast agent quantification provides the potential for earlier characterization of pathologies on molecular level.",

      "abstract": "For linear arrays with fixed steering and an inter-element spacing smaller than one half of the wavelength, end-fire steering of a data-independent beamformer offers better directivity than broadside steering. The introduction of a lower bound on the white noise gain ensures the necessary robustness against random array errors and sensor mismatches. However, the optimum broadside performance can be obtained using a simple processing architecture, whereas the optimum end-fire performance requires a more complicated system (because complex weight coefficients are needed). In this paper, we reconsider the oversteering technique as a possible way to simplify the processing architecture of equally spaced end-fire arrays. We propose a method for computing the amount of oversteering and the related real-valued weight vector that allows the constrained directivity to be maximized for a given inter-element spacing. Moreover, we verify that the maximized oversteering performance is very close to the optimum end-fire performance. We conclude that optimized oversteering is a viable method for designing end-fire arrays that have better constrained directivity than broadside arrays but with a similar implementation complexity. A numerical simulation is used to perform a statistical analysis, which confirms that the maximized oversteering performance is robust against sensor mismatches.",

      "abstract": "Planar arrays of acoustic sensors represent a critical component for a 3-D wideband passive imaging system. Recently, a method has been proposed for the design of planar microphone arrays that are superdirective (to provide good performance at low frequencies) and aperiodic (to avoid grating lobes at high frequencies). Robustness against dispersion in the sensor characteristics is achieved by exploiting the probability density functions of such errors. Here, such a method is used to demonstrate that 36 low-cost poorly-matched hydrophones are sufficient to populate a square aperture with a side length of 60 cm used as sensor array for an underwater passive system working from 1.5 kHz to 12 kHz.",

      "abstract": "Underwater acoustic measurements have been recently carried out in Tethys Bay (Ross Sea, Antarctica) during the XXIX Italian Antarctic Expedition to support acoustic propagation studies in the area and to investigate the environmental noise. Tethys Bay is a small deep cove close to the Antarctic Italian base Mario Zucchelli Station (Baia Terra Nova -74°42' S e 164°07' E) and covered with sea-ice for most of the year. During the period of the experiment (November 2013) the pack-ice had an almost constant thickness of about 2.2 m, so that the measurements were performed deploying the instruments into the sea from holes drilled through the pack ice. The holes were located along the bay axis at a distance of about 500 m each other. The sea depth was around 200 m except for the hole close to the coast, where the sea depth was only 25 m. An hydrophone RESON TC 4032 was located in the outermost hole, while the acoustic source, a transceiver transmitting FSK pulses at 11 kHz, was placed in sequence in the other three holes. Every time, the measurements were performed at 0, 20 and 45 m depth for each configuration. Furthermore during the experiment, sea temperature, salinity and currents, as well as the main meteorological parameters were continuously measured. The analysis here reported mainly focuses on the acquired acoustic passive data. The passive measurements evidenced that the signal was generally dominated by different sounds from seals, which was prevailing on the noise due to human activities.",

      "abstract": "Maximization of the directivity with a constraint on the lower bound of the white noise gain is a typical strategy used to attain robust performance in superdirective arrays. However, array imperfections and sensor mismatches significantly reduce the nominal directivity, even in robust designs. We focus on the generalized directivity (i.e., the directivity of the mean beam power pattern, computed using the probability density functions of the array errors) as a reliable metric to assess the average performance. We show that the generalized directivity is an extension of the nominal directivity, corresponds to the array gain when the array errors are considered, and is strictly related to the mean directivity. We demonstrate that, unlike the mean directivity, the generalized directivity of a linear array (under fair assumptions for gain, phase, and position errors) can be computed in closed form. Starting from this result, we propose a method to analytically compute, through the generalized eigenvalues, the weight vector that maximizes the generalized directivity. The numerical results confirm that maximizing the performance by setting a lower bound for the white noise gain a priori is a critical operation. Differently, maximization of the generalized directivity directly provides the optimum average performance. Notable advantages in designing maximum directivity arrays and in achieving the maximum degree of superdirectivity are reported, particularly for linear arrays steered at end-fire.",

In this paper, two types of innovative dual-mode contrast agents are investigated and compared in terms of imaging performance. Existing ultrasound contrast agents composed of gas-filled microbubbles covered by a polymeric shell were modified to obtain dual-mode contrast agents. Different densities of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles were anchored to the external bubble surface or physically embedded into the bubble shell. The goal of this paper is to individuate the setup parameters and imaging techniques able to optimize the microbubble detection with both imaging modalities. Moreover, the type of dual-mode agent and nanoparticle density that offer the best balance between magnetic resonance and ultrasound contrast enhancement is identified. In vitro imaging experiments were carried out by applying low magnetic field (0.25 T), low acoustic pressures (< 300 kPa) and low concentrations of dual-mode contrast agents. Modified microbubbles with nanoparticles loaded on the external shell surface were found to provide the best contrast both in ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging.",

      "abstract": "Planar arrays are used jointly with filter-and-sum beamforming to achieve 3-D spatial discrimination in processing broadband signals. In these systems, the beams are steered in various directions to investigate a given portion of space. The band can be so wide as to require both superdirective performance (to increase directivity at low frequencies) and sparse aperiodic layouts (to avoid grating lobes at high frequencies). We propose an original method to simultaneously optimize the transducer positions and the coefficients of the Finite Impulse Response FIR filters, providing a solution that maintains its validity for whatever steering direction inside a predefined region of interest. A hybrid strategy, analytical for the coefficients and stochastic for the positions, is devised to minimize the beam pattern (BP) energy while maintaining an unaltered signal from the steering direction and controlling the side lobes. The robustness of the superdirectivity is achieved by taking into account the probability density functions for the characteristics of realistic transducers. A distinctive feature of our method is its ability to maintain the computational tractability of the addressed optimization problem by drastically reducing the burden of evaluating the cost function. The obtained results, addressing tens of transducers and several octaves of band, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of directivity, contrast, and robustness. © 2014 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The real-time generation of 3-D acoustic images by an active system deploying a planar array of transducers is difficult to implement because of the hardware cost and the associated computational burden. Recently, an exact method based on chirp zeta transform (CZT) beamforming has been proposed to dramatically reduce the computational burden of 3-D wideband imaging in the near- and far-field regions. However, the computational advantage of such a method decreases if the array is thinned. In this paper, the performance of CZT beamforming applied to sparse planar arrays is investigated and compared with those of other beamforming techniques. To address the sparse array challenge, a processing technique, called pruned CZT beamforming, is proposed, which exhibits a computational burden lower than that of the previous CZT beamforming technique while providing a significant advantage over the direct implementation of the frequency-domain beamforming and is applicable when the planar array is radically thinned. © 2014 IEEE.",

In vitro B-mode images are generated using a medical ultrasound scanner by applying a nonconventional signal processing technique that is suitable to detect polymeric bubbles and based on the combination of multipulse excitation and chirp coding. Even if both types of microbubbles can be considered to be effective ultrasound contrast agents, the different structure of the shell loaded with nanoparticles has a pronounced effect on the echogenicity and the detection sensitivity of the imaging technique. The best results are obtained using microbubbles that are externally coated with nanoparticles.

      "abstract": "Oversteering is a technique to achieving robust superdirective performance by end-fire arrays whose transducers are spaced less than half wavelength. To reduce the beamwidth, the main-lobe is pushed past end-fire by the introduction of additional delays. The reduction of the main-lobe sensitivity produces, in turn, an increase of the side-lobe level and a fall of the white noise gain. This paper proposes a method to compute the real-valued weight coefficients that yield the maximum directivity for a given oversteering amount and assure a white noise gain above a given threshold. If this optimization is carried out in parallel with the exhaustive search for the best oversteering amount, the optimum oversteering performance can be reached. Finally, it is shown that for a linear array composed of 8 transducers, the oversteering technique yields a directivity which is very close to that provided by the optimum complex-valued weight coefficients, requiring a simpler processing system and assuring the same robustness (i.e., the two solutions show the same white noise gain). © 2013 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "This paper describes the analysis of spread spectrum acoustic data for underwater point to point communication acquired during seatrials carried out in shallow water areas. The signals transmitted are modulated using a PSK direct sequence spread spectrum approach, employing differentially coherent modulation. The use of Gold pseudo noise sequences allows one to achieve private communication. On the receiver side, a rake receiver is used to positively exploit the energy present in multiple propagation paths. Moreover, a preliminary step of synchronization and parameter estimation necessary for Doppler compensation is performed together with a tracking procedure that allows an adaptation to the instantaneous Doppler shift. The analysis of real data received by a vertical array shows that the developed communication algorithm is capable to handle the multipath phenomenon and the variabilities typical of a shallow water channel, allowing one to achieve good performances at a bit rate of about 130 bit/s. In particular, in a shallow water channel (50 m deep) with ranges up to 1 km, the system is able to obtain zero errors if in reception more than one signal received by the vertical array is taken into account. © 2012 Acoustical Society of America.",

      "abstract": "The estimation of the contrast agent concentration is important for the introduction of effective quantification in ultrasound medical diagnoses. This paper focuses on the comparison of three methods for estimating the number of microbubbles in a small volume. An energy-based linear regression approach and a nonlinear regression approach are applied to estimate the microbubble concentration working from the signals backscattered by a contrast agent population. The nonlinear regression approach, based on the support vector machine, is employed assuming either only one feature, the signal energy, or a set of significant features. Synthetic data are used for the training phase and the test of the methods. The results demonstrate that, although the energy-based methods allows to achieve good results in terms of mean estimated values, the adoption of a vector of features significantly reduces the mean square error. The nonlinear regression approach with multidimensional feature vector allows to improve the measurement precision of the bubble concentration. © 2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Noise in the ocean is the result of many contributions. Sources emitting sound in open sea as well as in a coastal area can be placed both in the sea surface and underwater. Excluding the self-noise, the noise impinging a sonar system is called ambient noise and usually is split in two groups: anthropic and natural. In this paper we focus in modeling noise produced by ship transit, which falls in the anthropic category, and noise due to sea surface agitation, that is classified as a natural source. In particular we aspire to simulate the acoustic noise radiated by the machinery of a vessel once the rotational speed of the propeller induces the cavitation effect. Further, we take account of the wind speed action in the sea state and its contribution to the actual underwater ambient noise. An algorithm based on a non-Gaussian approach allows to generate sequence of samples representative of a noise realization having specified kurtosis level and to reproduce the desired source spectrum. The results of the simulation suggest that the surface ship transit can be thought as a major factor in limiting the performance of a underwater acoustic communications systems operating in a coastal shallow waters scenario. © 2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "This paper addresses the spatial processing of signals collected by a linear array of sensors that feeds a filter-and-sum, data-independent beamformer. When the frequency band spanned by the signals to be processed is extremely wide, a given array can be shorter than the wavelength (at the lowest frequencies) and, at the same time, too scarcely populated for a correct sampling of the wavefield (at the highest frequencies). Superdirectivity and aperiodic sparse layouts are possible solutions to these two problems. However, these two solutions have never been considered jointly to achieve a broadband beam pattern with a desired profile. Through a mixed stochastic and analytic optimization, a method is proposed herein that synthesizes a sparse array layout and the tap coefficients of the beamformer filters to provide a broadband beam pattern that is superdirective and robust against the fluctuation of the sensors' characteristics, which is free from any grating lobes and possesses a controlled side-lobe level. Different types of beam patterns, from the frequency-invariant pattern to the maximum-directivity pattern, can be obtained and the synthesized solutions retain their validity for any steering direction inside a given interval. The functioning of the method is proven by considering a microphone array with four different design targets and by discussing the performance and the robustness of the synthesized solutions. © 2006-2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "A multimodality contrast agent able to be detected with ultrasound and MRI can combine the advantages of the two diagnostic techniques. In this paper, a preliminary ultrasound assessment of two different types of innovative magnetic microbubbles is presented. In both cases, the combination of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles with polymeric microbubbles is used to produce the contrast agent. The only difference is the structure of the magnetic bubble: the nanoparticles are attached on the polymeric shell in the first case, while in the second case they are physically trapped into the membrane. After a preliminary comparison with polymer-shelled bubbles without magnetic nanoparticles, the performance of the two types of magnetic bubbles are compared through in vitro experiments. A non-conventional signal processing technique, particularly adapted to detect polymeric bubbles and based on the combination of multi-pulse excitation and chirp coding, is applied. The measurement of the contrast-to-tissue ratio reveals that the detection sensitivity of the signal processing technique depends on the structure of the magnetic microbubbles. © 2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "This paper focuses on the use of poly (vinyl alcohol)-shelled microbubbles as a contrast agent in ultrasound medical imaging. The objective was an in vitro assessment of the different working conditions and signal processing methods for the visual detection (especially in small vessels) of such microbubbles, while avoiding their destruction. Polymer-shelled microbubbles have recently been proposed as ultrasound contrast agents with some important advantages. The major drawback is a shell that is less elastic than that of the traditional lipidic microbubbles. Weaker echoes are expected, and their detection at low concentrations may be critical. In vitro experiments were performed with a commercial ultrasound scanner equipped with a dedicated acquisition board. A concentration of 100 bubbles/mm <sup>3</sup>, excitation pressure amplitudes from 120 kPa to 320 kPa, and a central frequency of 3 MHz or 4.5 MHz were used. Three multi-pulse techniques (i.e., pulse inversion, contrast pulse sequence based on three transmitted signals, and contrast pulse sequence in combination with the chirp pulse) were compared. The results confirmed that these microbubbles produce a weaker ultrasound response than lipidic bubbles with a reduced second-order nonlinear component. Nevertheless, these microbubbles can be detected by the contrast pulse sequence technique, especially when the chirp pulse is adopted. The best value of the contrast-to-tissue ratio was obtained at an excitation pressure amplitude of 230 kPa: although this pressure amplitude is higher than what is typically used for lipidic microbubbles, it does not cause the rupture of the polymeric contrast agent. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

      "abstract": "Recently, polymer-shelled microbubbles have been proposed, showing some important advantages. They offer both a mechanical stability and a distinctive feature to be easily targeted to a specific address within the body. This paper focuses on the opportunity of use polymeric microbubbles as contrast agent in medical imaging applications, where the nonlinear response is exploited and the destruction of bubbles is avoided. The major drawback of polymer-shelled microbubbles is related to the lower elasticity of their shell. Lower echoes are then expected. As a consequence, it is evident the risk that, for low/moderate pressure values, the response of these microbubbles is not sufficiently nonlinear to allow a good detection of the contrast agent presence. A non-conventional method, based on the transmission in temporal succession of three chirp pulses, is employed to detect polymeric bubbles at different acoustic pressures. The results reveal that this signal processing technique is particularly adapted for the detection of polymer-shelled microbubbles even at low acoustic pressures and low concentrations, where conventional techniques, as pulse inversion and contrast pulse sequence imaging, fail. © 2011 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Frequency-invariant beam patterns are often required by systems using an array of sensors to process broadband signals. If the spatial aperture is shorter than the involved wavelengths, using a superdirective beamforming is essential to get an efficient system. In this context, robustness of array imperfections is a crucial feature. In the literature, only a few approaches have been proposed to design a robust, superdirective, frequency-invariant beamformer based on filter-and-sum architecture; all of them achieve frequency-invariance by imposing a desired beam pattern. However, the choice of a suitable desired beam pattern is critical; an improper choice results in unsatisfactory performance. This paper proposes a new method of array synthesis that allows the design of a robust broadband beamformer with tunable tradeoff between frequency-invariance and directivity, without the need for imposing a desired beam pattern. The latter is defined as a set of variables that do not depend on frequency and are included in the vector of variables to be optimized. To this end, a suitable cost function has been devised whose minimum can be found in closed form. Therefore, the method is analytical and computationally inexpensive. In addition, a technique that allows obtaining a beam pattern with a linear phase over frequency is described. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in designing robust superdirective beam patterns for linear arrays receiving far-field signals, with special attention to microphone arrays of limited aperture. © 2011 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The estimation of the contrast agent concentration can provide useful information in medical diagnostics. Because the intensity of an ultrasound image is not directly correlated with the volumetric concentration of a contrast agent, a method that can estimate the concentration, working only from the signals acquired by the ultrasound scanner, could be particularly useful in terms of precision, time consumption and cost. In this paper, a method to obtain the ultrasound image of a region of interest and the estimation of the related microbubble concentration is proposed. The mentioned tasks are performed in a unique investigation, working from the signals remotely acquired by means of an ultrasound scanner equipped with a grabber board, which is able to collect radio-frequency data. The algorithm is divided into two steps. Firstly, a signal-processing technique, based on multi-pulse transmission and recombination of the received signals, is used to obtain an image of the scene, emphasizing the bubble echoes and abating the contributions of surrounding tissue. Then, the concentration estimation method, based on a nonlinear regression approach carried out by a support vector machine, is applied. Because the training phase requires precise knowledge of the bubble concentration, a completely synthetic training set is assumed, whereas the test set is derived from real signals. In this paper, both non-specific and targeted microbubbles (able to selectively adhere to cancer cells) are considered. The results are encouraging and reveal that the proposed method can provide an accurate estimation in a small volume, which can be useful for diagnostic purposes. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.",

In this paper, such problems are overcome by the optimized synthesis of an aperiodic sparse array and the efficient processing of the acquired signals carried out in the frequency domain and based on Chirp Zeta Transform (CZT) beamforming. On the one hand, the synthesized sparse array enables the device to operate at frequencies yielding an acceptable side-lobe level and a good tradeoff between the sector of view and the resolution. On the other hand, the CZT beamforming, specifically devised to cope with the requirements of volumetric sonar imaging, allows the processing of wideband signals collected by a planar array and generated by a scene encompassing both near-field and far-field regions. The combination of a very limited number of sensors with the CZT beamforming generates a computational load that is two orders of magnitude lower than that of the delay-and-sum beamforming and one order of magnitude lower than that of the traditional frequency-domain implementation. The reduction of the number of sensors and the computational load produces, in turn, a noticeable reduction of the hardware cost. Copyright © (2010) by the International Congress on Acoustics.",

      "abstract": "Next-generation ultrasound contrast agents, in the form of tiny gas bubbles, can be targeted to selectively adhere to cancer cells. The number of attached microbubbles could be correlated with the status of the cancer. Consequently, the estimation of bubble concentration can provide useful medical information in addition to ultrasound molecular imaging. In this paper, a method to obtain the ultrasound image of a region of interest and the estimation of the related microbubble volumetric concentration is proposed. The mentioned tasks are performed in an unique investigation, working on the signals remotely acquired by means of an ultrasound scanner. The algorithm is divided into two steps. Firstly, a signal processing technique, based on multi-pulse transmission and recombination of the received signals, is used to obtain an image of the scene and to detect the bubble echoes abating surrounding tissue contribution. Then, the residual bubble echo, remained after the application of the technique, is processed in order to estimate the concentration. The concentration estimation method is based on a nonlinear regression approach, carried out by a support vector machine. Preliminary in vitro experiments provided encouraging results. © 2010 IEEE.",

As the synthesis process requires an iterative minimization, it may become unacceptably long.

      "abstract": "A planar array of sensors is required to collect the signals coming from a 3-D scene to generate volumetric underwater acoustic images. The method most frequently used to process the acquired signals is a digital beamforming algorithm. In general, owing to the high number of sensors and beam signals, the computational load is prohibitive for real-time image generation. In the literature, a frequency-domain beamforming technique based on the chirp zeta transform (CZT), which is efficient and computationally advantageous, has been introduced for linear and planar arrays working in the far field. This paper proposes an extension of the CZT beamforming that has been specifically devised to cope with the requirements of volumetric sonar imaging. In particular, the processing of wideband signals collected by a planar array and generated by a scene placed in both near-field and far-field conditions is enabled with a computational load that is one or two orders of magnitude lower than that of the traditional frequency-domain and time-domain beamforming implementations. To attain this result, the Fresnel delay approximation, a useful definition of steering angles, and the setting up of multiple focal regions are adopted. In addition, a computationally convenient technique to generate cubic resolution cells is introduced. © 2005 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The development of techniques to separate the response of the contrast agent from that of the biological tissues is of great importance in ultrasound medical imaging. In the literature, one can find various solutions involving the use of multiple transmitted signals and the weighted sum of related echoes. In this paper, the combination of one of these multi-pulse techniques with a coded excitation is proposed and assessed. Coded excitation has been used mainly to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the penetration depth, provided that a matched filtering is applied in the reception chain. However, it has been shown that a signal with a long duration time also increases the backscattered echoes produced by the microbubbles and, consequently, the contrast-to-tissue ratio. Therefore, the implementation of a multi-pulse technique using a long coded pulse can yield a better contrast-to-tissue ratio and SNR. This paper investigates the combination of the linear chirp pulse with a multi-pulse technique based on the transmission of three pulses. The performance was evaluated using both simulated and real signals, assessing the improvement in the contrast-to-tissue ratio and SNR, the visual quality of the images obtained and the axial accuracy. A comparison with the same multi-pulse technique implemented using a traditional amplitude-modulated pulse revealed that the deployment of a chirp pulse produces several noticeable advantages and only a minor drawback. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.",

      "abstract": "Medical ultrasound imaging instrumentation typically performs image interpolation using the signals acquired after envelope extraction, i.e., noncoherent signals. This operation is completely satisfying when the Nyquist condition for spatial sampling is fulfilled. However, the maximum spatial frequency of a signal increases as a consequence of the envelope extraction, making it more difficult to fulfill the Nyquist condition. For this reason, this paper suggests the interpolation of signals before envelope extraction, i.e., the use of coherent data, and discusses the applicability of this procedure to actual ultrasound scanners. Emphasis is given to the linear-array imaging technique, and the adoption of windowed sinc functions as interpolation kernels with limited support is assessed. Moreover, the authors investigated the situation in which coherent signals are also undersampled, and perfect reconstruction is not at all possible. The investigation was carried out using a numerical study and a simulated imaging test, and it was supported by subjective and objective evaluations. It is concluded that, at a moderate undersampling level, the interpolation of coherent signals allows significantly better performance than the interpolation of noncoherent signals. © 2009 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The processing and analysis of images generated by mechanically scanned sonar systems have received poor attention despite their widespread application. In this paper, some efficient methods for acoustic image enhancement and automatic object detection are presented and assessed using a large set of experimental data collected at sea with commercial sonar systems. Specifically, a set of methods for increasing the quality of the gray-level images produced by a fan-shaped-beam sonar is introduced. Such a set includes a dynamic brightness assignment, a precise interpolation, a speckle-reduction filter, and a contrast-enhancement block. Two versions of a template-matching-based method that allows the automatic detection of a simple object contained in a region scanned with a pencil-beam sonar are also proposed and assessed. The main difficulty to be coped with in this field is related to the sparseness of the binary maps generated by this sonar system. The performance and robustness of the proposed techniques have been evaluated using real data that provided satisfactory results for both the image-enhancement and the object-detection tasks. Moreover, the computational burden of most of the proposed techniques turned out to be quite limited, and their real-time implementation with a standard computer architecture could be estimated. © 2009 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "To generate volumetric underwater acoustic images, a planar array of sensors is required to collect the signals coming from a 3-D scene. The method most frequently used to process the acquired signals is a beamforming algorithm. In general, owing to the high number of sensors and beam signals, the computational load is prohibitive for real-time image generation. An efficient frequency beamforming implementation based on the use of the chirp zeta transform (CZT) has been proposed in the literature for the case involving linear arrays. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to perform CZT beamforming on the wideband signals collected by a planar array generated by a scene placed in the far field. This extension becomes simpler and more intuitive thanks to a nonconventional method of defining the azimuth and elevation angles. In terms of computational complexity, the analysis compares the solution developed with traditional beamforming techniques carried out in both time and frequency domains, showing several advantages for the proposed method. © 2009 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "One of the important issues in the field of ultrasound medical imaging using contrast agents is the development of techniques able to separate the response of the contrast media from that of the biological tissues. In the literature, one can find various solutions involving the use of multiple transmitted signals and the combination of related echoes. However, the quality of these techniques may be reduced due to some undesired effects that are seldom considered, despite the fact that they are always present in real systems. These effects are the signal distortions introduced by the hardware equipment, the thermal noise in the electronic circuitry, and body motion between successive pulses. In this paper we propose a simulation tool that will allow the calculation of the backscattered echo from a population of contrast agents immersed in a biological tissue, considering all the mentioned effects. With this tool, an assessment of the comparative robustness of three well-known multi-pulse techniques has been carried out under realistic working conditions and the performance of the three techniques has been evaluated in terms of contrast-to-tissue ratio and signal-to-noise ratio. The results show that the undesired effects have a strong impact on these techniques and that there are notable differences in their robustness. Finally, some suggestions on the choice of the particular technique to be applied are provided on the basis of the specific work conditions. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

      "abstract": "Coded excitation is generally used in imaging to increase the signal to noise ratio (SNR) and the penetration depth. Only in recent years, coded excitation has been introduced for clinical ultrasound. The employment of this solution with contrast agents enhances the contrast to tissue ratio (CTR), since a signal with a long time duration is able to increase the backscattered echoes produced by microbubbles. However, nonlinear properties of contrast agents make decoding problematic in case of applying coded excitation to contrast imaging. An advantageous solution could be combining a multipulse technique, in particular one of the Contrast Pulse Sequences (CPS), with the chirp coding: a chirp excitation method for contrast agents based on the transmission and the opportune combination and post-processing of three chirp pulses is introduced (Chirp CPS3). The method proposed is compared to the Contrast Pulse Sequence technique based on the transmission of three uncoded signals (CPS3). Preliminary results are obtained considering simulated signals. The comparison of the methods reveals, under the same conditions, an increment of about 8 dB in the CTR and 17.5 dB in the SNR assured by the new technique. The simulation phase is followed by in-vitro tests that confirm the preliminary conclusions. The only drawback is represented in a loss of axial resolution: an 8 mm-diameter flow channel is overestimated of about 1 mm considering Chirp CPS3. ©2008 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, the preliminary design and assessment of a high-resolution 3-D acoustic imaging system based on a sparse planar array of sensors, which is particularly intended for underwater applications, are presented. Critical issues in the development of high-resolution 3-D sonar systems are 1) the cost of hardware, which is associated with the huge number of sensors that compose the planar array, and 2) the computational burden of processing the signals that were gathered. Here, such problems are overcome by the optimized synthesis of an aperiodic sparse array that allows the device to operate at different frequencies, yielding an acceptable sidelobe level and a good tradeoff between the field of view and the resolution. The array optimization is performed using an efficient stochastic method, in which the number of sensors is minimized, whereas their positions and weights are simultaneously optimized. To test the validity of the designed system, the signals that the sparse array received in response to the insonification of a scene with a wideband pulse are simulated, and voxel-based beamforming is applied to generate the 3-D image. The obtained images show high fidelity to the geometrical characteristics of the scene, in accordance with the expected performance of the 3-D sonar system. © 2008 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The investigation of man-made objects lying on or embedded in the sea floor can be carried out with acoustic imaging techniques and subsequent data processing. In this paper, we describe a processing chain that starts with a 3-D acoustic image of the object to be examined and ends with an augmented reality model, which requires minimal user involvement. Essentially, the chain includes blocks devoted to statistical 3-D segmentation, semi-automatic surface fitting, extraction of measurements, and augmented reality modeling. In particular, the 3-D segmentation method presented here is based on a volume-growing approach, which is essentially a 3-D extension of the traditional 2-D region growing. The volume-growing operation is guided by a statistical approach based on the optimal decision theory. The surface-fitting block is based on predefined geometric models, i.e., one of them is tentatively selected by the user after a preliminary study of the segmented object and is automatically or partially manually adapted to the segmented data by exploiting an inertial tensor. The proposed chain was successfully applied to the analysis of some 3-D acoustic images obtained from both simulated and real signals acquired by different sonar systems and containing objects that were completely or partially buried. The segmentation results provided an effective help in the identification of the object's shape, i.e., facilitating the subsequent surface-fitting step and the extraction of related measurements. © 2008 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The optimization of the ultrasound pulses transmitted by an echographic scanner is considered here in order to attain an insonification beam having a quasi-constant pressure profile over a large depth interval. An equalized pressure intensity allows a correct exploitation of the ultrasound contrast agent injected into the human body and, in turn, permits one to fully exploit its nonlinear response. A stochastic method of synthesis (based on the simulated annealing scheme) that is able to produce the desired transmission beam profile, acting simultaneously on the carrier frequencies of the acoustic pulses emitted by the array's transducers and on the apodizing weights, has been developed and assessed. The results obtained by the joint optimization, in terms of acoustic pressure profile, sidelobe level, and main lobe shape, are reported, discussed, and compared with those obtained by the traditional emission strategy and by the exclusive optimization of the apodizing weights or the carrier frequencies. A significant improvement of the ultrasound beam generated by the joint optimization over those generated by the exclusive optimization is pointed out. © 2007 IEEE.",

The use of chirp signals takes advantage of the low Doppler sensitivity in the matched filter operation whereas the choice of pseudo noise (PN) sequences allows one to reduce narrowband interference arising from other users and self-interference due to multipath propagation. The system here described is made of a transmitter encoding the bits with linear chirps multiplied by PN sequences, and a rake receiver that allows one to positively exploit the energy present in the most significant propagation paths. Moreover a tracking procedure that allows an adaptation to the instantaneous Doppler shift has been devised and tested.

      "abstract": "One of the most important issues in the field of contrast agents-based echographic imaging is the development of techniques able to separate the echoes of such contrast media from the echoes of the biological tissue: in particular in literature could be found various solutions concerning the use of multiple transmitted signals and the combination of related echoes. These techniques may undergo a reduction of performance, due to some undesired effects normally not taken into account, such as non-linearities introduced by hardware equipment and tissue propagation, thermal and electronic noise and body motion between successive pulses. Here we introduce a simulation tool that we developed, able to calculate the backscattered echo from a contrast agents population immersed in biological tissue, considering all the previous effects. By means of this tool, we performed a comparative analysis of the various multi-pulse techniques on the basis of the contrast to tissue ratio (CTR) and the signal to noise ratio (SNR) before and after the echoes summation. The results show the potentially strong impact of the undesired effects on these techniques and may provide useful hints on the choice of the particular technique to be applied, regarding the specific diagnostic application addressed and the hardware characteristics. © 2007 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "To generate volumetric underwater acoustic images a planar array of sensors is required to collect the signals coming from a 3-D scene. The method most frequently used to perform the spatial elaboration of the acquired signals is the beamforming algorithm. In general, owing to the huge number of sensors and the massive number of beam signals, computational load becomes prohibitive for real-time image generation. An efficient frequency beamforming implementation based on the use of the Chirp Zeta Transform (CZT) has been proposed in the literature for the case of a scene placed in the far-field and involving linear arrays. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to perform CZT beamforming on the wideband signals collected by a planar array and generated by a scene placed in the near-field. This extension becomes simpler and feasible thanks to (i) a non-conventional method of defining the azimuth and elevation angles; (ii) the Fresnel approximation in the delay computation; (iii) an adequate organization of the different operations. In terms of computational complexity, the analysis compares the solution developed with traditional beamforming techniques, showing several advantages of the proposed method. © 2007 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "To generate underwater volumetric acoustic images a planar array is the minimal requirement, as a linear aperture does not allow one to discriminate signals coming from a 3-D space. Therefore, the number of signals acquired by the receiving array and then processed by an adequate algorithm is often huge, giving rise to a computational load prohibitive for a real-time image generation. An efficient frequency beamforming implementation based on the use of the Chirp Zeta Transform (CZT) has been proposed in literature in case of linear equally spaced array. The contribution proposed in this paper is aimed at extending such an implementation to a planar array. In particular, as the direction of a beam inside a 3-D space involves the use of two steering angles, the choice of such angles is fundamental to extend the CZT beamforming to a 2-D array: a conventional formalism does not allow one to express the main computation as a discrete convolution, and thus to exploit the advantages of the fast Fourier transform. The conducted analysis, in terms of computational complexity and system performances, compares the developed solution with traditional beamforming algorithms implemented in time domains, showing several advantages of the proposed method. ©2006 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, some efficient methods for acoustic image enhancement and automatic object detection are presented and assessed on a specific class of real data. The aim is to increase the potentiality of mechanically scanned fan-shaped-beam and pencil-beam sonar systems employed during underwater operations. Concerning the fan-shaped-beam sonar system, a set of methods has been assessed that is devoted to increase the visual quality of the generated images. The first step is a scan conversion procedure, to move from a polar coordinate system as that of the sonar to a dense, regular matrix of pixels. An efficient interpolation step, working on the same polar coordinates of the sonar system, has been developed, that performs the computation of the value to assign to every pixel on the basis of the weighted average of the neighbouring acoustic samples. Moreover, a dynamic pixel brightness assignment law, evaluated image by image, is carried out to optimally exploit the available brightness range. The joint application of the interpolation method and the optimised brightness assignment allows one to improve image quality thus providing a simple and effective tool to generate particularly refined acoustic images. Finally, further processing steps allow to reduce typical problems blurring this kind of imaging systems, like speckle noise, multiple echoes and low contrast. Concerning the pencil-beam sonar system, two methods are proposed and assessed that allow the detection of a simple object contained in the imaged region. In particular, one of these methods is novel and has been devised ad-hoc to advantageously exploit the specific data organization that characterizes the pencil-beam sonar system. Satisfactory outcomes in terms of accuracy in object location and computational load are achieved. The real-time requirement can be easily satisfied by using a common personal computer. The performance of the proposed techniques has been evaluated using real data collected by the addressed sonar heads during different trials at sea. ©2006 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, the design and the assessment of a high-resolution three-dimensional acoustic imaging system based on a sparse planar array of sensors are presented. The aim is to generate useful acoustic 3-D images in underwater context. Towards this end, a planar array is mandatory, as a linear aperture does not allow one to discriminate signals coming from a 3-D space. One critical issue in the development of high-resolution 3-D sonar systems is the hardware cost associated to the necessary huge number of sensors. In this paper, an innovative 3-D imaging system able to operate at different resolution levels is proposed that is based on a single sparse planar array consisting of only 584 elements. Such a limited number of sensors represents an important stage in designing 3-D acoustic imaging systems, making feasible the achieving of a drastic reduction in both costs and successive processing associated to the system. The array optimization is performed by an efficient stochastic method based on the simulated annealing algorithm, in which the positions and the weights of the array elements are optimized simultaneously. To test the validity of the proposed system, the signals received by the sparse array as the response of a given scene insonified by a pulse are simulated. To move from the simulated signals to the 3-D image of the scene, a voxel-based beamforming in the time domain is designed. To assess the proposed acoustic imaging system, several complex scenes are taken into account and images are obtained that exibit a high fidelity to the geometrical and physical characteristics of the assumed underwater environments. © 2006 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, harmonic beamforming (HB), a technique proposed by the authors to improve the quality of tissue-harmonic imaging and contrast-agent imaging processes in medical echography, is briefly presented. It relies on a modification to the delays used in reception beamforming that notably reduces the echoes centered on the fundamental frequency while keeping the echoes centered on the second harmonic and preserving focusing quality. The HB is assessed in terms of its spectral and spatial characteristics, harmonic-to-fundamental ratio (HFR), and range resolution for different bandwidths of the insonifying pulse. The tuning of the parameters involved in HB and its effects are investigated in detail. The results are compared with those provided by traditional methods of harmonic imaging, clearly showing some advantages in the application of the proposed beamforming scheme. Such advantages are also confirmed by analyzing and comparing the results obtained in a simulated contrast-agent imaging task, where HB generated the most similar images to those yielded by the pulse-inversion approach. Therefore, HB is a very promising technique, also considering that it can be very easily incorporated in current ultrasound medical scanners without any hardware modification or frame-rate reduction. © 2006 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a method able to emulate the signals received by a sonar system exploring a submerged environment. The simulation of the response of an underwater scene insonified by a wideband pulse has been based on the reproduction of the interactions of the acoustic field with a buried object, with the seabed surface, and with the sediment volume. The signals gathered by the sonar array are emulated by modeling the surfaces of both the seabed and objects as a dense random grid of small discrete scatterers, by following Rayleigh's law, and by integrating the responses of the scatterers. The roughness effects are simulated by allowing random distances from the actual scatterer positions to their nominal positions on the surface. Sediment-volume inhomogeneities are modeled by a random distribution of the small asymmetrical scattering volumes, characterized by their three-dimensional (3-D) dimensions, densities, and sound velocities. In general, the simulator is very flexible in defining the object, the related scenario, and the major physical parameters involved. A voxel-based beamforming to generate the 3-D images starting with the simulated signals is also presented and briefly discussed. The 3-D images obtained appear very realistic and contain all the expected elements in the right relationships, including the typical speckle noise. © 2006 IEEE.",

The reality of the simulated signals is discussed on the basis of 3-D images of scenes containing complex objects. © 2005 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, the design of a high-resolution three-dimensional acoustic imaging system based on a sparse planar array of sensors is presented. The aim is to generate useful acoustic 3-D images in underwater context Towards this end, a planar array is mandatory, as a linear aperture does not allow one to discriminate signals coming from a 3-D space. One critical issue in the development of high-resolution 3-D sonar systems is the hardware cost associated to the necessary huge number of sensors. In this paper, an innovative 3-D imaging system able to operate at different resolution levels is proposed that is based on a single sparse planar array consisting of only 584 elements. Such a limited number of sensors represents an important stage in designing 3-D acoustic imaging systems, making feasible the achieving of a drastic reduction in both costs and successive processing associated to the system. The array optimization is performed by an efficient stochastic method based on the simulated annealing algorithm, in which the positions and the weights of the array elements are optimized simultaneously. To test the validity of the proposed system, the signals received by the sparse array as the response of a given scene insonified by a pulse are simulated. To move from the simulated signals to the 3-D image of the scene, a voxel-based beamforming in the time domain is designed. Images are obtained that dibit a high fidelity to the geometrical and physical characteristics of the assumed underwater environment. © 2005 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "This work describes some of the ongoing activities in the framework of the EU-sponsored project SITAR aimed at developing acoustic methods for imaging of waste barrels/containers of small dimension buried in unconsolidated sea sediments. In particular, the work relies on acoustic subbottom scattering measurement techniques, with adaptive geometrical configuration of the transmitting/receiving system. The approach ultimately leads to a full 3D measurement of the acoustic scattered field, including bottom and sub-bottom effects, plus the scattering due to buried objects in the scene. The 3D dense acoustic image is then processed in order to automatically extract relevant object(s) features, as size, 3D orientation, impedance contrast; this is obtained through a sequence of processing steps including filtering, enhancement, restoration and image segmentation. Preliminary results obtained with simulative data are presented: data are obtained by modeling the surfaces of both seabed and object(s) as a dense, random grid of discrete scatterers, following the Rayleigh reflection coefficient, and integrating the response of the scatterers. The effects due to absorption and refraction moving from water to sediments are also considered. Sediment volume inhomogeneities are modeled by a random distribution of small asymmetric scattering volumes, characterized by their 3D dimensions, density, and reflection coefficient. A volume growing segmentation approach has been applied, showing efficient segmentation capabilities, and robustness to uncertainty. ©IMACS.",

      "abstract": "This paper describes a method to obtain a wide-band beam pattern whose main lobe has the desired shape and, at the same time, the level of the side lobes is acceptable. The aim is to reproduce a main lobe profile as close as possible to the desired one through the synthesis of the array-weighting window. A typical goal is to obtain, in wide-band conditions, a flat-top shaped beam similar to the ones produced by specific narrow-band windows. To achieve this result, an optimization process based on simulated annealing is developed and applied under different operating conditions, including two wide-band beam pattern definitions and different values of the fractional bandwidth. Although the shape of the resulting main lobe is not as good as the one obtained in narrow-band conditions (the reasons for this drawback are given), it is shown that the adoption of windows synthesized by the proposed method is more suitable than the direct application of narrow-band windows in wide-band conditions. In addition to providing better performances, it is shown that the windows synthesized by the proposed method also result in greater robustness to random perturbations of weight values, which are unavoidable in real systems. © 2005 IEEE.",

The harmonic beamforming is then assessed in term of beam pattern, harmonic-to-fundamental ratio, and range resolution. The tuning of the parameters involved in the harmonic beamforming and the related effects are investigated.

      "abstract": "In this paper, a method able to emulate the signals received by a sonar system exploring the submerged environment is presented. The simulator is devoted to producing a large and wide-ranging data set of 3-D images; it is very flexible in defining an object, the related scenario, and the major parameters involved. Signals are obtained by modeling the surfaces of both the seabed and objects as a dense, random grid of discrete scatterers, following the Rayleigh reflection coefficient, and integrating the responses of the scatterers. Sediment volume inhomogeneities are modeled by a random distribution of small asymmetric scattering volumes, characterized by their 3-D dimensions, densities, and reflection coefficients. The reality of the simulated signals is discussed on the basis of 3-D images of scenes containing complex objects. ©2004 IEEE.",

The aim is to obtain a data-independent beam pattern that fulfills some a priori fixed constraints. The analytical approach, expressed in terms of a linear least-squares problem, has been attempted, resulting in very large noise sensitivity and beam pattern instability. To overcome this problem a mixed methodology, based on a combination of a stochastic technique and a local descent method that provides very robust weight coefficients with reduced noise sensitivity, is proposed.

      "abstract": "This paper presents a study on the worsening caused by a random perturbation of the weighting window (modeling, in this way, the uncertainty on the channel sensitivity), or by an alteration of the shape of the transmitted pulse, for a wideband array. In the stability evaluation, main-lobe width and signal to noise ratio evaluated at different dB levels of the beam pattern play the role of quality parameters. Two different profiles of the weighting window have been used for this analysis: a typical raised cosine, and a window optimized by a Simulated Annealing procedure. Also for the pulse envelope, two distinct shapes have been chosen: perfectly Gaussian and experimentally measured. The analysis of the obtained results provides useful hints about the amount and the kind of the beam pattern worsening, when realistic fluctuations occur. Moreover, the results show that the weighting windows provided by the simulated annealing procedure are particularly robust to such fluctuations. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

The 3-D dense acoustic image is then processed by a segmentation procedure in order to automatically extract relevant features of the objects. In this paper it is described a simulation approach that is able to emulate the acoustic signals received by a sonar system exploring the submerse environment.

      "abstract": "This paper describes a complete set of methods for arranging acoustic images of the sea floor by projecting and interpolating data gathered with a novel front-scan sonar system, developed in the context of the EC-COSMOS project. Traditional sonar imaging systems for sea-floor analysis generate acoustic images during the motion of a ship; on the contrary, the front-scan sonar system not only provides information unreachable by traditional devices (blind region), but also does not need the ship motion to compose a whole image of the sea floor. Two different projection methods have been devised: a simpler analytical solution and a more precise ray-tracing approach. The development of an analytical solution is possible under the classical assumptions about a flat sea floor and a constant sound velocity profile; when these hypotheses are not realistic or a more precise image is required, a numerical solution obtained by a ray-tracing approach can be applied, which is based on some ad hoc solutions worked out for the front-scan sonar system. To move from the projection results to an image defined over a dense matrix of pixels, an interpolation stage is needed. To this end, an algorithm based on the generation of virtual-beam signals (only where necessary) has been tested and compared with more-traditional techniques. The potentials of the proposed projection and interpolation methods have been evaluated and some comparisons have been made, using real data gathered with the COSMOS sonar prototype during trials at sea.",

      "abstract": "This paper describes a set of methods that make it possible to estimate the position of a feature inside a three-dimensional (3-D) space by starting from a sequence of two-dimensional (2-D) acoustic images of the seafloor acquired with a sonar system. Typical sonar imaging systems are able to generate just 2-D images, and the acquisition of 3-D information involves sharp increases in complexity and costs. The front-scan sonar proposed in this paper is a new equipment devoted to acquiring a 2-D image of the seafloor to sail over, and allows one to collect a sequence of images showing a specific feature during the approach of the ship. This fact seems to make it possible to recover the 3-D position of a feature by comparing the feature positions along the sequence of images acquired from different (known) ship positions. This opportunity is investigated in the paper, where it is shown that encouraging results have been obtained by a processing chain composed of some blocks devoted to low-level processing, feature extraction and analysis, a Kalman filter for robust feature tracking, and some ad hoc equations for depth estimation and averaging. A statistical error analysis demonstrated the great potential of the proposed system also if some inaccuracies affect the sonar measures and the knowledge of the ship position. This was also confirmed by several tests performed on both simulated and real sequences, obtaining satisfactory results on both the feature tracking and, above all, the estimation of the 3-D position.",

      "abstract": "We report here details of the design, development, initial testing and field-deployment of the HOLOMAR system for in-situ sub-sea holography and analysis of marine plankton and non-living particles. HOLOMAR comprises a submersible holographic camera (\"HoloCam\") able to record in-line and off-axis holograms at depths down to 100 m, together with specialised reconstruction hardware (\"HoloScan\") linked to custom image processing and classification software. The HoloCam consists of a laser and power supply, holographic recording optics and holographic plate holders, a water-tight housing and a support frame. It utilises two basic holographic geometries, in-line and off-axis such that a wide range of species, sizes and concentrations can be recorded. After holograms have been recorded and processed they are reconstructed in full three-dimensional detail in air in a dedicated replay facility. A computer-controlled microscope, using video cameras to record the image at a given depth, is used to digitise the scene. Specially written software extracts a binarised image of an object in its true focal plane and is classified using a neural network. The HoloCam was deployed on two separate cruises in a Scottish sea loch (Loch Etive) to a depth of 100 m and over 300 holograms were recorded.",

      "abstract": "This paper describes methods for arranging acoustic images of the seafloor by projecting and interpolating data gathered with a novel front-scan sonar system. Two different projection methods have been devised: a simpler analytical solution and a more precise ray-tracing approach. In this paper, the ray-tracing approach will be investigated with special attention on the theoretical and practical difficulties arising out of the innovative application of a front-scan sonar system to seafloor imaging. In particular, specific strategies have been devised to minimize the number of acoustic rays necessary to provide a good matching with all the samples (differing in time and steering angle) acquired by the sonar systems. To exploit the projection results in order to obtain an image defined over a dense grid of pixels, an innovative interpolation algorithm, based on the generation of virtual beam signals (only where necessary) has been got ready. The proposed projection and interpolation methods have been tested, and comparisons have been made, using real data gathered with the front-scan sonar prototype during trials at sea. The joint application of the ray-tracing projection approach and the virtual-beams interpolation technique allows one to generate high-quality images, which can be merged to create a mosaic seafloor image. The precision and quality of the resulting mosaics confirm the high degree of effectiveness of the methods proposed in this paper to project acoustic data and interpolate single images.",

The front-scan sonar devoted to generate a 2-D image of the seafloor to sail over, and allows one to collect a sequence of images showing a specific feature during the approach of the ship. This fact seems to make it possible to recover the 3-D position of a feature by comparing the feature positions along the sequence of images acquired from different (known) ship positions. A feature extraction and analysis, a Kalman filter for robust feature tracking, and some ad hoc equations for depth estimation are proposed. Simulated image sequences demonstrated the great potential of the developed system, even though real sequences pointed out some inaccuracies due to errors concerning the knowledge of the ship position and the discrete image nature.",

In addition, also the methods of array thinning proposed in the literature has been devised mainly under narrow-band conditions. In this paper, after a proper definition of the wide-band beam pattern, a method is proposed that is aimed at determining the values of the weight coefficients to be assigned to the minimum set of elements of a linear array that generates a beam pattern fulfilling some a priori fixed constraints. This method relies on a stochastic scheme based on the simulated annealing algorithm.

      "abstract": "In this paper, a signal-processing technique for the detection of objects buried in the seafloor by exploiting an active sonar system is proposed and assessed. The technique is based on the modeling of the reverberation phenomenon as an autoregressive process. The detector is composed of an adaptive prewhitening filter and a bank of matched filters. The autoregressive parameters are computed by algorithms (based on the modified-covariance function or on the higher-order statistics) that work on successive short reverberation segments. No echoes of the buried target have been used to arrange the matched filters but only echoes of the same target floating in free water. The proposed technique has been tested on an experimental data set related to a steel cylinder deeply buried in the seafloor and 20 m far from a parametric sonar source. The obtained performances have been compared with those achieved without the prewhitening stage. The results yielded by the described technique are impressive, in spite of the weak signal-to-reverberation ratio and the low (subcritical) grazing angle used during the experiments.",

      "abstract": "Systems able to retrieve objects embedded in the seafloor are of crucial importance for many different tasks. In this paper, an experimental assessment of a detector applying the \"classify-before-detect\" paradigm is proposed. The evaluation is based on real data acquired, during two sea trials, by two different sonar systems using low grazing angles and placed far from a target object. The \"classify-before-detect\" paradigm is a pattern-recognition approach to designing a classifier aimed at distinguishing between two classes (i.e., target presence and target absence), just like a detector. This approach has been selected and developed as it is very well suited to exploiting the available statistic and spectral a priori information on the target echo. In short, some features are extracted from the Wigner-Ville distribution and the bispectrum of partially overlapped short segments of the acquired echo signals. The dimensionality of the problem is reduced by the principal-component analysis, and the reduced feature vector is sent to a supervised statistical classifier, e.g., the multivariate Gaussian one. The ideal training set is composed of pure reverberation signals and the responses of the target in free field at different aspect angles. However, also not ideal training sets were tested. Although the signal-to-reverberation ratio was close to 0 dB, the above method yielded very satisfactory results in terms of detection and false-alarm probabilities, also in comparison with other more traditional detection methods.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, a novel method that is able to synthesize a desired asymmetric beam pattern by a fully optimized linear array to be used together with a narrow-band beamforming system is proposed. Generally, the methods presented in the literature optimize only the weight coefficients and do not consider the element positions. Therefore, when half-wavelength-spaced arrays are concerned, the optimized weight coefficients are valid only for a fixed steering angle. If the steering angle changes, it is necessary to recompute a new set of weight coefficients to keep the desired asymmetric beam pattern profile. The main feature of the method proposed here is that the synthesized weight coefficients keep their validity in any steering direction. This is attained by acting on both the element positions (in order to generate an aperiodic array) and the weight coefficients. To this end, a well-suited energy function has been defined and several conceptual mechanisms have been devised in order to minimize the energy function by the simulated annealing algorithm. As a result, a very flexible method is achieved to synthesize array configurations that yield asymmetric beam patterns that keep their validity in any steering direction without need for any update.",

Such a method optimizes the positions and the weight coefficients of each element of a linear array in order to obtain a beam pattern that meets given requirements. Moreover, while positions and weights are optimized, minimization of both the number of elements and the spatial aperture is carried out. In this way, a beam pattern without grating lobes and close to the desired one is produced using a small number of elements and a short aperture. The results obtained are impressive in terms of improvement of array characteristics and performance over those reported in the literature, while a great flexibility in defining the desired beam pattern is allowed. Finally, it is proved that the array configurations need a number of elements very close to the absolute minimum to achieve the desired beam pattern.",

      "abstract": "Pulsed laser holography is an extremely powerful technique for the study of particle fields as it allows instantaneous, non-invasive high-resolution recording of substantial volumes. By replaying the real image one can obtain the size, shape, position and - if multiple exposures are made - velocity of every object in the recorded field. Manual analysis of large volumes containing thousands of particles is, however, an enormous and time-consuming task, with operator fatigue an unpredictable source of errors. Clearly the value of holographic measurements also depends crucially on the quality of the reconstructed image: not only will poor resolution degrade size and shape measurements, but aberrations such as coma and astigmatism can change the perceived centroid of a particle, affecting position and velocity measurements. For large-scale applications of particle field holography, specifically the in situ recording of marine plankton with 'HoloCam,' we have developed an automated data extraction system that can be readily switched between the in-line and off-axis geometries and provides optimised reconstruction from holograms recorded underwater. As a videocamera is automatically stepped through the 200 by 200 1000mm sample volume, image processing and object tracking routines locate and extract particle images for further classification by a separate software module.",

      "abstract": "Underwater exploration is becoming more and more important for many applications involving physical, biological, geological, archaeological, and industrial issues. Unfortunately, only a small percentage of potential resources has been exploited under the sea. The inherent structureless environment and the difficulties implied by the nature of the propagating medium have placed limitations on the sensing and the understanding of the underwater world. Typically, acoustic imaging systems are widely utilized for both large-and small-scale underwater investigations, as they can more easily achieve short and large visibility ranges, though at the expense of a coarse resolution and a poor visual quality. This paper aims at surveying the up-to-date advances in acoustic acquisition systems and data processing techniques, especially focusing on three-dimensional (3-D) short-range imaging for scene reconstruction and understanding. In fact, the advent of smarter and more efficient imaging systems has allowed the generation of goodquality high-resolution images and the related design of proper techniques for underwater scene understanding. The term acoustic vision is introduced to generally describe all data processing (especially Image processing) methods devoted to the interpretation of a scene. Since acoustics is also used for medical applications, a short overview of the related systems for biomedical acoustic image formation is provided. The final goat of the paper is to establish the state of the art of the techniques and algorithms for acoustic image generation and processing, providing technical details and results for the most promising techniques, and pointing out the potential capabilities of this technology for underwater scene understanding. © 2000 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, an advanced signal processing technique devoted to the detection of buried objects by exploiting an active sonar system is proposed. The technique is based on the modeling of the reverberation phenomenon as an auto-regressive process. The detector consists of an adaptive pre-whitening filter and a bank of matched filters. The auto-regressive parameters are computed by a higher order statistics algorithm that works on short successive reverberation segments. No echoes of the buried target have been used to arrange the matched filters, but only echoes of the target in free water. The proposed technique has been tested with an experimental data set related to a steel cylinder deeply buried in the sea bottom, obtaining impressive results in spite of the very low signal to reverberation ratio. This work was performed owing to the European Commission support, in the context of the contract DEO (Detection of Embedded Objects).",

Beamforming is often used to build a range image from backscattered echoes, associated point by point with the intensity information that may represent the confidence of each range measure. In the proposed algorithm, range and confidence images are modelled as Markov Random Fields (MRFs). The energy functional has been designed to fully embed the physics of the acoustic image-formation process and model the a priori knowledge. Optimal (in the maximum a posteriori probability sense) estimates of the reconstructed range image map and the restored confidence image are obtained by minimizing the energy functional by using simulated annealing. Experimental results show the improvement of the processed images over those obtained by other methods performing separate restoration and reconstruction processes.",

      "abstract": "This paper describes a flexible technique to enhance the formation of short-range acoustic images so as to improve image quality and facilitate the tasks of subsequent postprocessing methods. The proposed methodology operates as an ideal interface between the signals formed by a focused beamforming technique (i.e., the beam signals) and the related image, whether a two-dimensional (2-D) or three-dimensional (3-D) one. To this end, a reliability measure has been introduced, called confidence, which allows one to perform a rapid examination of the beam signals and is aimed at accurately detecting echoes backscattered from a scene. The confidence-based approach exploits the physics of the process of image formation and generic a priori knowledge of a scene to synthesize model-based signals to be compared with actual backscattered echoes, giving, at the same time, a measure of the reliability of their similarity. The objectives that can be attained by this method can be summarized in a reduction in artifacts due to the lowering of the side-lobe level, a better lateral resolution, a greater accuracy in range determination, a direct estimation of the reliability of the information acquired, thus leading to a higher image quality and hence a better scene understanding. Tests on both simulated and actual data (concerning both 2-D and 3-D images) show the higher efficiency of the proposed confidence-based approach, as compared with more traditional techniques. © 1999 IEEE.",

The optimized design of such arrays is a required task in order to control the side-lobe level and distribution. In this paper, an optimization method aimed at designing aperiodic linear sparse arrays with great flexibility is proposed. Simulated annealing, which is a stochastic optimization methodology, has been utilized to synthesize the positions and the weight coefficients of the elements of a linear array in order to minimize the peak of the sidelobes and to obtain a beam pattern that meets given requirements. An important novelty is the fact that the latter goal can be achieved in parallel to the minimization of both the number of elements and the spatial aperture, resulting in a `global' optimization of the array characteristics. The great freedom that simulated annealing allows in defining the energy function to be minimized is the main reason for the notable versatility and the good results of the proposed method. Such results show an improvement in the array characteristics and performances over those reported in the literature.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a technique for the segmentation of three-dimensional images acquired by an acoustic camera. The proposed algorithm aims at identifying reliable data derived from objects present in an underwater scene in order to determine elementary components. In this way, the estimation of geometrical parameters for each component is performed with the aim of subsequently performing object-recognition and reconstruction phases. The algorithm is composed of a series of processing steps, starting from a coarse segmentation stage, wherein the most reliable image points likely to correspond to man-made objects are identified, and leading to a refinement phase, in which accurate re-segmentation is performed, to accurately determine points belonging to the same surface. Once objects' components have been identified, geometrical parameters are estimated in order to build an adequate data structure that is easily comparable with a model database. In other words, it exploits the geometrical properties embedded in the sparse and noisy three-dimensional information to group the points better by fitting the current quadric surface. This algorithm can be applied for the reconstruction of virtual environments from acoustic data aimed at robotic applications (e.g. vehicle navigation) and was actually used in an off-shore application consisting of the recognition of the scene seen by an underwater vehicle navigating close to an oil rig. Results on synthetic images proved the goodness and the accuracy of the approach and real examples are also provided to prove the robustness and accuracy of the method.",

In other words, a statistical classifier has been employed to distinguish between two classes (i.e., target presence and target absence) exactly like detectors. Concerning classification, the focus has been placed on the exploitation of the object resonances and a Neural Network has been designed. As a first step the possibility for the network to be properly trained has been assessed, while as a second step the discrimination capability has been verified. The above methods have been tested with an experimental data set in which the echoes of a steel cylinder were embedded in real reverberation echoes, according to low signal-to-reverberation ratios.",

      "abstract": "This paper describes a probabilistic technique for the coupled reconstruction and restoration of underwater acoustic images. The technique is founded on the physics of the image-formation process. Beamforming, a method widely applied in acoustic imaging, is used to build a range image from backscattered echoes, associated point by point with another type of information representing the reliability (or confidence) of such an image. Unfortunately, this kind of images is plagued by problems due to the nature of the signal and to the related sensing system. In the proposed algorithm, the range and confidence images are modeled as Markov random fields whose associated probability distributions are specified by a single energy function. This function has been designed to fully embed the physics of the acoustic image-formation process by modeling a priori knowledge of the acoustic system, the considered scene, and the noise-affecting measures and also by integrating reliability information to allow the coupled and simultaneous reconstruction and restoration of both images. Optimal (in the Maximum A-Posteriori probability sense) estimates of the reconstructed range image map and the restored confidence image are obtained by minimizing the energy function using simulated annealing. Experimental results show the improvement of the processed images over those obtained by other methods performing separate reconstruction and restoration processes that disregard reliability information. © 1998 IEEE.",

If there are residual fringes in the residue image, then the model must be improved. The interferogram is subdivided into squares for each of which the local slopes in azimuth and range are estimated by computing the mean slopes in azimuth and range. Using the local slopes and a least-squares algorithm (Gauss-Seidel relaxation) the values of the model in the vertexes of the grid are obtained, and then by bilinear interpolation the phase at each pixel can be evaluated. If an improvement of the model is needed, the process is repeated iteratively with as the input image the residue image as a \"new\" interferogram, until a certain stop condition is reached.

The stochastic algorithm of simulated annealing has been utilized to minimize the number of elements necessary to produce a spatial response that meets given requirements. The proposed methods is highly innovative, as it can face very large arrays, optimize both positions and weight coefficients, synthesize asymmetric arrays and generate array configurations that are valid for every scan direction.

A voting-based approach is here described able to recognize objects and to estimate their two-dimensional pose by using information coming from boundary segments and their angular relations. The method is directly applied to the edge discontinuities of underwater acoustic images, whose quality is usually affected by some undesired effects such as object blurring, speckle noise, and geometrical distortions degrading the edge detection. The voting approach is robust with respect to these effects, so that good results are obtained even with images of poor quality.

      "abstract": "This article describes a probabilistic technique for the restoration of underwater acoustic images that is based on the Markov random fields (MRFs) methodology. The beamforming is applied to rough acoustic data that derive from multibeam systems or acoustic cameras to build a three-dimensional (3D) map, that is associated point by point with the estimates of the reliability of such measures. Specifically, backscattered echoes that are received by a 20 array antenna are arranged to generate two images in which each pixel represents the distance (range) from the sensor plane and the confidence of the measures, respectively. Unfortunately, this kind of image is affected by several problems due to the nature of the signal and the related sensing system. In the proposed algorithm, the range and the confidence images are modeled as separate MRFs whose associated probability distributions embed knowledge of the acoustic system, of the considered scene, and of the noise affecting the measures. In particular, the confidence image is first restored and the result is used to reconstruct the 3D image to allow an active integration of the reliability information. Optimal (in the maximum a posteriori probability sense) estimates of the reconstructed 3D map and the restored confidence image are obtained by minimizing the energy functional, using simulated annealing. Experimental results on synthetic and real images show the performance of the proposed approach. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

      "abstract": "This paper describes a voting-based approach for the fast automatic recognition of man-made objects and related attitude estimation in underwater acoustic images generated by forward-looking sonars or acoustic cameras. In general, the continuous analysis of sequences of images is a very heavy task for human operators and this is due to the poor quality of acoustic images. Hence, algorithms able to recognize an object on the basis of a priori knowledge of the model and to estimate its attitude with reference to a global coordinate system are very useful to facilitale underwater operations like object manipulation or vehicle navigation. The proposed method is capable of recognizing objects and estimating their two-dimensional attitude by using information coming from boundary segments and their angular relations. It is based on a simple voting approach directly applied to the edge discontinuities of underwater acoustic images, whose quality is usually affected by some undesired effects such as object blurring, speckle noise, and geometrical distortions degrading the edge detection. The voting approach is robust, with respect to these effects, so that good results are obtained even with images of very poor quality. The sequences of simulated and real acoustic images are presented in order to test the validity of the proposed method in terms of average estimation error and computational load.",

      "abstract": "This communication addresses the evaluation of beam patterns (BPs) in active beamforming systems using wide-band signals and sparse arrays. Usually, BPs are computed under a narrow-band hypothesis according to which a simple analytical and closed-form equation can be used. In this communication, with reference to imaging applications, the BP for wide-band signals is redefined on the basis of beam-signal maxima, and a quasi-closed form of the analytical formulation is achieved for any inter-element spacing. It can be noticed that, under wide-band conditions, the height of these grating lobes can be predicted and that depends only on the pulse duration and on the number of array elements, but does not depend on the spacing between elements. As a result, the proposed quasi-closed form supports the design of very sparse arrays that show beam-pattern profiles of great interest for imaging applications. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes a co-operative approach to the extraction of a scene profile on the basis of the signals generated by a beamforming acoustic imaging system, mainly for human understanding and underwater vehicle applications as navigation, inspection, and manipulation. The beamformer combines echoes backscattered from a scene sonicated by a pulse and received by an array of sensors. Time signals representing the echoes coming from precise directions (called beam signals) are the output of the beamformer. Our approach is essentially a voting method: each sample of each beam signal contributes with an opportune quantity in a voting space, The integration of two methods, one devoted to the angle of arrival estimation and the other devoted to the time of arrival estimation, occurs in the voting space. At the end of the process, maxima recovery in the voting space and other post-processing methods are applied to recover the precise silhouette of a scene. Results on actual and simulated data are reported in order to compare our method with other possible methods.",

The specific goal is to eliminate two additive spurious terms present in the beam signals. The first effect is due to side lobes and the second one is due to the nonlinear effects introduced by the modulus extractor present at the output of the beamformer. The relative importance of these two terms is assessed, showing that the term due to modulus extraction has a strong negative incidence on the final image quality. The Gaussian distribution of these spurious terms is discussed and verified in the case of punctiform scenes. Owing to the Gaussianity of the spurious terms, a method to eliminate them from the beam signals, based on Higher Order Spectra analysis, is proposed, resulting in an evident image quality and reliability improvement.",

Beam-forming is used to build a 3D map associated with another image representing the confidence (i.e., reliability) of measures. Beamforming processes backscattered echoes (received by a two-dimensional array antenna) coming from a scene previously insonified, forming two images where each pixel represents the distance from the sensor in a specified direction and the confidence (reliability) of measures. In the proposed algorithm, depth and confidence images are modelled as Markov Random Fields whose associated probability distributions are specified by a single energy functional. This functional embeds a-priori knowledge on the images and on the noise affecting measurements in the image formation process. Confidence measures are also considered to improve the restoration. The Maximum A-Posteriori (MAP) criterion is adopted to perform restoration of both images and simulated annealing is used to find the optimal MAP estimate. Experimental results show the improvement in the resulting images as compared with initial data.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes a hybrid approach aimed at precise echo detection for improving short-range underwater images generated by beamforming process. The final goal is the construction of the scene model as accurately as possible to be used by an autonomous vehicle to navigate in the environment. Our approach is essentially a voting method. It consists in the integration of two methods based on the estimation of the angle of arrival for each time instant and the estimation of the time of arrival for each fixed direction. Each sampled time instant of each beam signal contributes with an opportune quantity on a voting space. At the end of the process, maxima recovery in the voting space and post-processing methods are applied to recover the precise silhouette of the scene. Angular-scan sonar data were simulated in order to verify the validity of the idea. Results are reported in order to compare our method with commonly used echo estimation methods, showing advantages and drawbacks of our approach.",

      "abstract": "This paper describes a technique for automatic fast orientation estimation and recognition of man-made objects present in underwater acoustic images. A method able (a) to estimate the orientation of the object principal axis, and (b) to recognize the object itself by using information about boundary segments and their angular relations, is presented. This method is based on a simple voting approach applied directly to the edge discontinuities of an image. Often, in underwater acoustic images some undesired effects are present, such as halos around objects, speckle that creates discontinuities, and distortion. Voting approach is very robust with respect to these effects, so allowing good results also when images have a very poor quality. A sequence of real acoustic images is shown for testing the proposed technique validity.",

Some problems may arise when an acoustic image is built directly on the basis of the envelope of the beam signals (as it is generally done) and this affects the quality of the results. The image quality can improve by using a general criterion operating as an interface between the beam signals and the image pixels. For each beam signal, this measure, called confidence level, assesses the reliability of the actual echoes in function of the similarity with expected echoes. Results obtained, in both real underwater 2D and simulated 3D images, are reported.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to describe a noncoherent correlation technique for the formation of 3-D acoustic images, mainly for underwater applications. This technique is applied to the envelope of signals received by a 2-D array. The performances of the technique are compared with those of the coherent technique of focused beamforming in terms of angular resolution, depth of field, beam pattern, and accuracy in range determination. Moreover, special attention is given to the modalities for an efficient implementation on a digital computer. The complete absence of grating lobes, for whatever arrangement of the transducers, and the much higher speed of the imaging process, as compared with that of beamforming in the time domain, are the two major advantages of this technique. A reduction in the speckle effect, the possibility of creating a virtual depth of field, the feasibility of using square-law transducers, and the implementation simplicity are additional interesting characteristics. The results of some simulations are reported and compared with those obtained by the beamforming process. © 1994 IEEE",
