      "abstract": "A computationally efficient three-dimensional B-Spline Rankine Panel Method (B-RPM), tailored for solving the double-body flow problem in marine hydrodynamics and seakeeping scenarios with a free surface, is presented. The double-body flow, which is the main and time-independent contribution, serves as the basis flow for the overall hydrodynamic problem for time domain ship motions, ruled by the Laplace equation. Initially, a technique was developed that employed constant source distributions to solve the double-body flow. In a subsequent phase, the method is enhanced for problems involving hydrodynamic circulation by incorporating B-Spline sources and normal dipoles distributions on both body and free surfaces. An integral approach has been devised, leveraging the second Green identity and constant sources distribution to address double-body flow and evaluate potential second derivatives on the free surface, respectively. While focused on simple geometries for initial simulations and validation, this work marks the first stage of a broader time-domain model. The findings demonstrate that the B-RPM enables achieving comparable results with fewer panels than traditional constant source distribution methods. Additionally, it makes the direct analytical calculation of potential derivatives possible.",

      "abstract": "The problem of the so-called dark vessels is a major security issue related to the marine traffic and environment. In this respect, the automatic ship detection from satellite imagery is one of the possible countermeasures in the fight against illegal activities. Technically, such a way of detecting dark vessels mainly relies on the identification of the far field wake released by a hull which might be visible over a significant distance from the hull itself and which might last in the water surface for a reasonable amount of time to be seen by a satellite. However, the shape and the persistence of such a wake field, which includes both the steady wave pattern and the turbulent wake behind the hull, is strongly affected by other phenomena mainly related to the weather conditions, then including the presence of surface wind waves or other patterns on the sea surface. Moreover, there might be unfavorable conditions for the satellite to produce accurate images to be used in this recognition process. This complex situation is faced in a project funded by the Italian Ministry of University and Research called UEIKAP (Unveil and Explore the In-depth Knowledge of earth observation data for maritime Applications) in which an Artificial Intelligence (AI) system for the automatic identification of dark vessels from optical and SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) images is under development. The training of the AI framework is based on both publicly available image datasets and ad-hoc synthetic data. The latter are generated by using Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations on a set of hulls in different operating conditions. The proposed analysis focused on the numerical issues related to the prediction of the far-field wake of a hull in the light of the final purpose of the UEIKAP project. A comparison of two different CFD approaches is shown and discussed in terms of pro and cons of both methods and the obtained results.",

      "abstract": "Wave Augmented Hydrofoil Technology (WAHT) aims to convert hydrofoil movement, induced by ship motion, into thrust force, and ship's resistance reduction in waves. Despite the growing interest in WAHT, a significant research gap remains in understanding the complex interactions between hydrofoil design parameters and wave-induced thrust generation. A hydrofoil attached to a ship serves dual roles; reducing the ship resistance in waves and generating thrust force. To distinguish the resistance reduction to the thrust generation, this study considers an isolated active hydrofoil without the ship's hull. This approach captures the critical interactions driven by ship motion, while allowing for a focused analysis on thrust generation. The active hydrofoil orientation is harmonically adjusted according to the flow vertical velocity that results in a suitable angle of attack. The generated thrust is studied by varying the hydrofoil rotation angle, aspect ratio, wavelength, and forward speed. The vertical velocity of KRISO Container Ship (KCS) in a range of regular waves is already available where KCS model alone (without WAHT) was simulated using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Simulation of isolated hydrofoil reveals increase of the vertical velocity, span-to-chord ratio, and forward speed of the hydrofoil enhances thrust force. For the studied cases, a 2.5% enhancement of mean generated power relative to required power in waves is concluded.",

      "abstract": "The detection of 'dark' ships, vessels operating without Automatic Identification System (AIS) transponders, is a crucial challenge for maritime security and international law enforcement. Traditional methods based on optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery face limitations, particularly in detecting small, fast-moving vessels under complex environmental conditions. The UEIKAP project, funded by the Italian Ministry of University and Research under the Research Projects of National Interest (PRIN), explores a novel approach to ship detection by analyzing their wakes, which provide key information about vessel activity.This paper presents a multi-modal Deep Learning (DL)-based wake detection framework that integrates optical and SAR satellite imagery, AIS data, meteo-marine measurements, and synthetic wake models. The system integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and contextual environmental data to enhance classification accuracy. The first experimental campaign, conducted in the Venice lagoon in July 2024, provided initial validation of the method, confirming the dependency of wake visibility on local meteo-marine conditions. Future campaigns in the Gulfs of Genoa and Naples will further refine the methodology.By combining advanced DL techniques with multidisciplinary data fusion, the UEIKAP project aims to improve maritime domain awareness, offering a robust tool for vessel monitoring and regulatory enforcement. This paper describes the operational planning of the validation campaigns set to take place during Spring-Summer 2025. It also provides a general overview of the project's framework, giving details regarding the processing pipeline, the involved algorithms, the training setup, the data, and some preliminary results.",

      "abstract": "Detecting 'dark' ships, vessels operating without active Automatic Identification System (AIS) transponders or spoofing their signal to evade surveillance, is a critical challenge for maritime surveillance. The UEIKAP project (Unveil and Explore the In-depth Knowledge of Earth Observation data for maritime Applications) provides a new ship detection framework that aims to enhance maritime monitoring by focusing on the detection of wakes, instead of the ship itself. Unlike hull detection, which suffers from issues related to image resolution and is only useful to obtain the instantaneous position of vessels, wake detection provides information about vessel movement, offering insights about its velocity and heading. This project leverages a deep learning-based framework that integrates multiple data sources, including Earth Observation (EO) imagery, meteo-marine measurements, and AIS data. The fusion of such data is used to improve maritime monitoring and ship wake detection. The proposed system architecture comprises multiple modules dedicated to wake detection, including a detection model based on the YOLO family of object detection models and a classification model designed to differentiate between different sea surface phenomena with visible signatures in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery. The functionality of each module is demonstrated through representative examples. Initial results from the UEIKAP system demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting ship wakes under diverse environmental conditions. Performance metrics are analyzed, and the advantages of incorporating meteo-marine data are highlighted. The data fusion approach is shown to enhance maritime domain awareness by improving extraction of the navigational status of vessels and the characterization of the complex sea surface background.",

      "abstract": "Monitoring uncooperative vessels without transponders is of strategical interest both for the civil and military world. Ship detection lacks the ability to discern full situational knowledge of the vessel. However, moving ships generate wakes containing significant information - from current and possibly past position, heading, and speed, to vessel size and hull class. UEIKAP (Unveil and Explore the In-depth Knowledge of earth observation data for maritime Applications) is a project founded by the Italian Ministry of University and Research, and its objective is to develop a deep learning-based solution for wake detection in optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) spaceborne remote imagery. A dataset of real and simulated imagery is under development and will be used to train a landmark-based detection model able to exploit the characteristic features of ship wakes. This is accompanied by an in-depth sea characterization and meteo-marine conditions study, which is used to properly discriminate sea surface clutter for the objects of interest. All the results will be validated by test campaign at sea. This manuscript goes over the different types of data used to obtain the aforementioned contextual knowledge for project UEIKAP, from Automatic Identification System (AIS) data providers to sources of local meteo-marine information. Indications are provided regarding the integration of these inomogeneous data sources with the deep learning-based wake detection architecture. Information on the methods of the first data gathering campaign, held in July 2024 in Venice, is provided, accompanied by observations and preliminary results gathered from the experience.",

The method is based on two-dimensional potential flow theory in which viscous forces are considered through a cross-flow drag approach. The obtained results show a good agreement with other published theoretical and experimental results. Thanks to the high computational efficiency of the approach, the sensitivity analysis is carried out in a design by optimization fashion, hence spanning over a wide design space to capture the possible existing correlations among the geometric features of the vessel and both its seaworthiness and wave resistance performance, aiming to identify the best catamaran configuration at a very early stage of the design process.",

      "abstract": "Three-dimensional effects induced by dimensional ratios on the gap resonances happening in twin hull vessels oscillating in forced vertical motion have been analyzed. They can lead to relevant consequences, such as the amplification of the inner radiated waves or the generation of standing waves in between the demi-hulls, that can have a direct effect on the operating profile of the vessel. The response of twin hull vessels in waves can be strongly affected by these resonant phenomena. Also, some of these behaviors can be exploited in the framework of wave energy conversion systems. The present analysis is carried out by using an open-source, linear, Boundary Element Method (BEM), based on the Green function approach. Mathematical backgrounds of the added mass and damping coefficients computation for a floating body under harmonic vertical oscillation are provided as well as details of the numerical discretization used in the BEM. A panel mesh sensitivity study is carried out and the numerical prediction is validated by comparison against available experimental data, another CFD solution obtained by a high-fidelity viscous solver based on the open-source libraries Open-FOAM and approximate analytic formulations. The effect of the beam ratio and the length-to-beam ratio on the resonant phenomena has been analyzed. This has been achieved by systematic variations of the geometric dimensions of the hull, focusing on the trends of the hydrodynamic coefficients, the amplitude of the radiated waves, and the location of the resonant frequencies over the analyzed range.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents the results of the hydrodynamic optimization of a large yacht concept design that is meant to be used as a reference for future buildings. The optimization framework is used to improve the calm water resistance performance of a generic baseline design while satisfying a set of geometrical constraints. The shape of the hull is modified according to a geometrical interpolation approach where two shapes are combined to obtain a third design. The search towards the optimum is driven by a global convergence, multi-objective, genetic algorithm where the resistance of each candidate is evaluated by a Boundary Element Method. The final optimal design is then verified by means of a high-fidelity Reynolds Averaged Navier–Stokes technique, preliminary validated against available experimental data. The obtained results show the strong influence of the stern shape of the hull on the final resistance performance, highlighting the effects of the pressure recovery due to a so-called S-shape bottom. The bow shape is modified consistently to fulfil the geometric constraints and to further improve the resistance performance by inducing a positive interference effect on the generated wave pattern.",

      "abstract": "Submarines’ manoeuvrability both in intact and degraded operating conditions is the main design concern starting at the very early stages of design. This increased complexity of the design process compared to a surface vehicle can only be handled by using dynamics numerical simulations on both the vertical and horizontal manoeuvring planes. To this aim, a 6-DoF method is presented, validated, and applied to study the manoeuvring characteristics of several vessels. The analysis has been conducted considering two standpoints, i.e., to verify the design handling capabilities of the vehicles at low and high speeds and to study the off-design residual abilities in the eventual case of emergency operations with jammed/lost-control surfaces. The influence of different design features, such as, e.g., the stern plane “+” and “x” configurations, fairway size and positioning, hull dimensional ratios and restoring capabilities have been analysed in terms of impact on turning ability, course and depth changing abilities, and vertical/horizontal course stability, including the vertical damping ratio and critical velocity.",

      "abstract": "There exist vast areas of offshore wind resources with water depths greater than 100 m that require floating structures. This paper provides a detailed analysis on the hydrostatic stability characteristics of a novel floating wind turbine concept. The preliminary design supports an 8 MW horizontal-axis wind turbine with a custom self-aligning single-point mooring (SPM) floater, which is to be constructed within the existing shipyard facilities in the Maltese Islands, located in the Central Mediterranean Sea. The theoretical hydrostatic stability calculations used to find the parameters to create the model are validated using SESAM<sup>®</sup>. The hydrostatic stability analysis is carried out for different ballast capacities whilst also considering the maximum axial thrust induced by the rotor during operation. The results show that the entire floating structure exhibits hydrostatic stability characteristics for both the heeling and pitching axes that comply with the requirements set by the DNV ST-0119 standard. Numerical simulations using partial ballast are also presented.",

      "abstract": "The interaction of the free surface with either lifting and non lifting, submerged, bodies moving beneath it is of primary interest in naval architecture. Indeed, there are many examples of possible applications such as rudders, stabilizer fins, hydrofoils among the others. The hydrodynamic problem of a submerged lifting body moving close to a free surface presents several complexities that need to be properly addressed in order to achieve a reliable solution. The problem is studied in the framework of a potential flow theory and solved by using an ad-hoc developed Vortex Lattice Method (VLM). The developed method is described and validated by comparison against available data on a flat plate. The analysis then focuses on the convergence properties of the method, especially with respect to the panel dimensions used for the free surface discretization, and on a sensitivity with respect to some peculiar operating parameters such as the depth of the body with respect to the free surface and the angle of attack with respect to the incoming flow.",

      "abstract": "Sailing at snorkel depth is a necessary but dangerous operating scenario for submarines. The main and straightforward reason is that such an operating condition represents a time of possible vulnerability of the vessel. From a design perspective this condition affects the so-called indiscretion rate, that is exactly the ratio between this time of greater vulnerability and the total operating time. Moreover, when the vessel operates at snorkel depths there are some relevant operations that might be accomplished related to both snorkeling, communications and threats detection. These operations are typically carried out by using a certain number of masts, of slightly different shapes and sizes, that might be used in various configurations. The proposed study aims at providing some insights into the unsteady, turbulent, hydrodynamics of several submarine masts configurations. The analysis is carried out in terms of behaviors of the developed free surface, considering the nonlinear interactions rising among the masts considered. The maximum height and length of the breaking wave generated at the bow of each mast is analyzed. Both the near field and the far field unsteady wave patterns are discussed comparing several configurations and focusing on the interaction effects. The computational study is carried out by using an open-source Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamic solver called DualSPHysics, able to exploit the computational acceleration provided by GP-GPU cards.",

      "abstract": "Submarines bring many interesting hydrodynamic challenges that need to be properly addressed to provide precise and reliable information about their performance. Hydrodynamic performance must be evaluated at least in two main operating conditions, namely when it is deeply submerged and at snorkel depth. There are relevant differences in terms of hydrodynamic since the forward speed in the latter condition is typically much lower and of interaction with the free surface. Moreover, submarines used to sail at snorkel depth if they need to accomplish specific tasks, such as communication, that involves the use of surface piercing masts. The proposed study analyses the opportunity provided by different Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) approaches to correctly address submarine performance. The resistance in both conditions, masts free surface hydrodynamics and maneuvering behaviors are addressed. Ad-hoc approaches based on in-house developed numerical procedures and open-source software are presented.

      "abstract": "A Simulation Based Design Optimization method for marine propellers design using a two-fidelity levels metamodel for global design space exploration and optimization is presented. Response surfaces are built using the co-Kriging approximation, i.e. a multi-output Gaussian process that combines large low-fidelity dataset with few, costly, high-fidelity data. The method is applied for the hydrodynamic shape optimization of the E779A propeller using, as fidelity levels, two different physical models for the propeller performances prediction, namely an inviscid, potential based Boundary Element Method (low-fidelity) and a viscous, finite volume RANS solver (high-fidelity). Results demonstrate the feasibility of multi-objective, constrained, design procedures, like those involving marine propellers, using these multi-fidelity response surfaces. At the same time, the need of good correlations between low- and high-fidelity data feeding the response surfaces is highlighted as a requisite for robust and reliable predictions using these approximated methods.",

      "abstract": "The offshore wind energy market is fast-growing, particularly in the EU where 102.6 GW are expected to be added by 2030 on top of the 220 GW currently installed. There exist vast areas of offshore wind resources with water depths greater than 100m necessitating floating structures. The paper explores the hydrostatic stability characteristics of a novel floating wind turbine concept, having a single point mooring system and self-aligning capabilities to eliminate a rotor yaw mechanism. The preliminary design supports a 8 MW horizontal-axis wind turbine with a custom floater that can be constructed within the shipyard facilities available in Maltese Islands. The hydro static stability analysis is carried out for different levels of ballast while considering the maximum axial thrust induced by the rotor during operation. It is shown that the entire floating structure exhibits favourable hydrostatic stability characteristics for both the heeling and pitching axes, meeting the requirements set by the DNV ST0019 standard.",

      "abstract": "The hydrodynamics of surface piercing struts and pile-like structures in general presents some very complex fluid dynamics phenomena that are worth investigating. Among them there are the forward wave pile-up at stagnation, the wave breaking with flow reversal like that observed in Bidone-type hydraulic jumps, flow separation caused by interactions of steep free-surface waves and the turbulent wall boundary layer. Such a type of flow structures plays a key role in several engineering applications, ranging from naval architecture to civil and ocean engineering. The hydrodynamic analysis of different surface-piercing struts in tandem configuration has been done in the framework of a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamic approach available through the open-source software DualSPHysics, developed to exploit the GP-GPU architecture to speed up the computation. A numerical wave tank has been set-up to carry out calm water tests. Beyond the influence of the forward speed, the analysis has focused on the effect of three main geometric parameters establishing the configuration: the longitudinal and the lateral distance among the vertical, surface-piercing, struts and the relative size among them. The mean and the rms values of the unsteady near-field free surface elevation have been analyzed and compared among the selected cases and interaction effects are studied in comparison to the free surface obtained for the equivalent single strut configuration.",

Such a numerical scheme, widely applied in aerodynamics, is particularly suitable to model the lifting effects thanks to the vortex distribution used to discretize the boundaries of the lifting bodies. The method has been developed with specific boundary conditions to account for the development of steady free surface wave patterns. Both submerged bodies, such as flat plates and hydrofoils, as well as planing hulls can be studied. The method is validated by comparison against available experimental data and other Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) results from Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) approaches. In all the analyzed cases, namely 2D and 3D flat plates, a NACA hydrofoil, planning flat plates and prismatic planing hulls, results have been found to be consistent with those taken as reference. The obtained hydrodynamic predictionsare discussed highlighting the advantages and the possible improvements of the developed approach.",

      "abstract": "A method for the morphing of surface/volume meshes suitable to be used in hydrodynamic shape optimization is proposed. Built in the OpenFOAM environment, it relies on a Laplace equation that propagates the modifications of the surface boundaries, realized by applying a free-form deformation to a subdivision surface description of the geometry, into the computational volume mesh initially built through a combination of BlockMesh with cfMesh. The feasibility and robustness of this mesh morphing technique, used as a computationally efficient pre-processing tool, is demonstrated in the case of the resistance minimization of the DTC hull. All the hull variations generated within a relatively large design space are efficiently and successfully realized, i.e., without mesh inconsistencies and quality issues, only by deforming the initial mesh of the reference geometry. Coupled with a surrogate model approach, a significant reduction in the calm water resistance, in the extent of 10%, has been achieved in a reasonable computational time.",

      "abstract": "The sensitivity of ship stability performance in waves to geometric variation has been investigated by means of a simulation-based design framework. The study was devoted to assess the influence of hull geometry variations on some stability failure modes, namely, parametric roll (PR) and pure loss of stability (PLS). The application has been developed by using a representative model of a postpanamax container vessel. PR and PLS phenomena have been investigated by the application of second-generation intact stability criteria (SGISc). The initial multidimensional design space has been filled by 500 design configurations identified by means of a design of experiments approach. A method developed in-house, combining the subdivision surface and free-form deformation approaches, has been used to create the whole set of design alternatives. The generated design configurations have been assessed analyzing the results derived from application of the first- and the second-level SGIS vulnerability criteria for both the selected stability failure modes. To strengthen the correlation behaviors, the design space has then been further explored by using 10k design configurations exploiting the capabilities of a surrogate model–based approximation, relying on a Gaussian process formulation. The study has been focused on the correlations among the variables and the response functions, i.e., the outcomes of the SGIS vulnerability criteria. The significance, in terms of effects, of each geometry shape variable has been investigated. Results have been discussed in the light of the SGISc structure, to provide further insight into this innovative safety framework for a modern approach to intact stability.",

      "abstract": "The study focuses on the analysis of the added resistance of a catamaran advancing both in regular waves and in a seaway. The numerical simulation has been carried out within the framework of potential flow theory by using a three dimensional, linear, Rankine source-based Boundary Element Method (BEM) and a Near-Field approach based on pressure integration for the first-order motions and the second-order longitudinal force prediction, respectively. A preliminary validation and verification study on both a mono-hull and a catamaran is proposed. A systematic analysis of the effect of some relevant operating and geometric parameters on the added resistance performance of a catamaran in waves is presented. Variations of the operating and geometric parameters include the advancing speed, the encounter angles from head to beam waves, the hull static trim and the demi-hulls separation. The trends of the added resistance pseudo-RAO are discussed in the light of the comparison against the reference design condition highlighting possible worse and optimal configurations.",

      "abstract": "The representation and the variation of hull shapes are two challenging problems in naval architecture due to the complexity of the geometry and to the need to ensure the fairness of the surfaces. Conventional CAD techniques are widely used to accurately describe the hull shape. However, they are rather complex to be easily used to generate hull shape variations due to the great number of variables involved. We propose a study to highlight the pro and cons of the application of space reduction techniques, usually referred to as Reduced Order Models (ROMs), to create a parametric model for both global and local hull shape variations. A geometric transformation relying on the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) method is applied on top of a combined subdivision surface — Free Form Deformation (FFD) approach conceived for modeling and variation of hull shapes. The analysis focuses on highlighting the geometric meaning of the new POD basis functions and on how this model affects the variability of the explored design space. Two studies are developed in order to show possible applications of this technique. In the first one a new set of selection criteria for the POD modes based on geometric considerations are proposed to use it on uncorrelated geometric domains. In the latter the large-dimensional space of the so-called Design Velocities (DV), related to the shape sensitivity, is reduced by using the POD approach to create a new transformation of the hull shape.",

      "abstract": "We propose a Simulation-Based Design Optimization (SBDO) approach for the design of an Energy Saving Device (ESD) based on the Wake Equalizing Duct (WED) concept. Pre-Ducts, like Wake Equalizing Ducts, reduce the wake losses, improve the propeller-hull interaction and generate an additional thrust. An integrated design approach, relying on a parametric description of the duct geometry of the WEDs and on a RANSE method, managed by a global convergence optimization algorithm, is developed to maximize the delivered thrust. The Japan Bulk Carrier (JBC) test case, for which model scale experimental data on the effectiveness of the WED are available in the literature, is considered as a baseline. Results obtained by using the adaptive, fully automated proposed design framework highlight significant improvements of the overall propulsive efficiency when the Pre-Duct design is tailored to the actual hull wake shape. In addition, off-design conditions are considered to verify the robustness of the proposed designs with respect to variations of the working point and discuss the opportunity of a robust optimization process.",

Keeping this in mind and considering that from a ship design perspective the definition of a hull shape is the first step of the whole design process, a reliable computer aided design model for shape representation and morphing becomes a key feature to navigate trough the design spiral. The proposed research focuses on the comparison of two different approaches to handle hull shape variations, namely the fully parametric model and a non-parametric method relying on the free form deformation technique. The comparison is developed considering both the easiness of building the shape of the reference model with its transformations laws and the resulting number of free design variables. The two methods are analyzed in the light of attainable hull shape variation in two design and modification test cases. The first is limited to the bulbous bow of a conventional hull while the second focuses on the whole surface of a fast, displacement, round-bilge hull.",

The effectiveness of the proposed approach is proven in the case of the INSEAN-E779A propeller, which blade shape is modified to maximise efficiency while reducing suction side cavitation. The 23-dimensions design space defined by the conventional shape representation is reduced by the POD method to 5, 12 and 15 dimensions, retaining up to the 98% of the geometric variance of the original space. A multi-objective optimisation algorithm drives the simulation-based design optimisation (SBDO) process in the new design spaces using BEM for the hydrodynamic predictions. Finally, optimal designs are verified using RANSE to assess the correlation between the performance improvements, the dimensionality reduction and the corresponding geometric variance.

      "abstract": "Achieving a reliable and accurate numerical prediction of the self-propulsion performance of a ship is still an open problem that poses some relevant issues. Several CFD methods, ranging from boundary element methods (BEM) to higher-fidelity viscous Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) based solvers, can be used to accurately analyze the separate problems, i.e. the open water propeller and the hull calm water resistance. However, when the fully-coupled self-propulsion problem is considered, i.e. the hull advancing at uniform speed propelled by its own propulsion system, several complexities rise up. Typical flow simplifications adopted to speed-up the simulations of the single analysis (hull and propeller separately) lose their validity requiring a more complex solver to tackle the fully-coupled problem. The complexity rises up further when considering a maneuver condition. This aspect increases the computational burden and, consequently, the required time which becomes prohibitive in a preliminary ship design stage. The majority of the simplified methods proposed in literature to include propeller effects, without directly solve the propeller flow, in a high-fidelity viscous solver are not able to provide all the commonly required self-propulsion coefficients. In this work, a new method to enrich the results from a body force based approach is proposed and investigated, with the aim to reduce as much as possible the computational burden without losing any useful result. This procedure is tested for validation on the KCS hull form in self-propulsion and maneuver conditions.",

      "abstract": "A computational framework for hydrodynamic shape optimization of complex ship hull form is proposed and applied to improve the calm water performance of the KRISO Container Ship (KCS). The framework relies on three key features: a novel shape morphing method based on a combination of subdivision surfaces and free form deformations, a robust three dimensional viscous computational fluid dynamic solver based on the openFOAM open-source libraries and a Gaussian process-response surface method (GP-RSM) based on ordinary Kriging model which has been created to speed-up the evaluation of the quantity of interest (QoI) of the design process. The accuracy of the hydrodynamic solver is proven by comparing the obtained results against available experimental measurements. A preliminary sensitivity analysis on the mesh size has been carried out aiming at reducing the computational burden required by the CFD predictions. Three GP-RSMs have been trained relying on increasing number of hull designs. Each surrogate model has been cross-validated by both leave-one-out and k-fold techniques. The behaviours of these multi-dimensional surfaces have been analyzed in details by sampling the investigated design space with 10<sup>7</sup> points according to a Full-Factorial algorithm, highlighting the regions of maximum deviation with respect to the resistance of the reference hull. The three optimum designs provided by the corresponding GP-RSM models have been verified by using high-fidelity CFD simulations with a refined mesh configuration. Calm water resistance, wave patterns and pressure distributions over the selected hull surfaces have been discussed in the light of the generated shape variations.",

      "abstract": "The engineering design of a three dimensional submerged hydrofoil operating at very high speeds is obtained leveraging a Differential Evolution (DE) approach. The final goal is to identify the optimal load distribution over the span of a super-cavitating hydrofoil by using a design by optimization approach driven by hydrodynamic analysis of complex, turbulent, multi-phase flows. We achieve this goal by modeling the load distribution over the hydrofoil by means of a B-spline curve, which provides a rigorous parametric description of the hydrofoil operating conditions through the points of the load distribution control polygon. The parametric model includes design variables representing the most relevant hydrofoil shape parameters. We predict hydrodynamic performance by means of a Viscous Lifting Line method specifically conceived for the application targeted in the present study. This computational model accounts for the strong non-linear hydrodynamic characteristics of super-cavitating hydrofoils. We demonstrate the validity of the proposed design by optimization framework for high speed super-cavitating hydrofoils showcasing two design applications, namely a fully submerged hydrofoil operating close to a rigid boundary and a surface-piercing hydrofoil with variable dihedral angle. A statistical analysis of DE algorithm is performed to assess its performance on such an engineering design problem.",

Numerical results are compared with high quality experimental measurements of the local flow field in terms of instantaneous and phase averaged values. The selected test case regards the propagation and breaking of regular non-linear waves on a smooth impermeable plane slope. The comparison is based on a complete set of 128 consecutive non-linear regular waves.

      "abstract": "The free surface turbulent flow around a vertical surface-piercing strut advancing in calm water has been studied by using an open-source Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) solver DualSPHysics. The strut has a symmetric NACA 0024 foil section and it advances with uniform rectilinear motion, at Froude number 0.55. The combination of high relative speed and blunt nose of the NACA shape result in a complicated free surface flow, featuring unsteady pile-up and wave breaking at the leading edge, deep wave through at mid-chord and turbulent unsteady separated flow at the trailing edge. The numerical predictions have been compared to experimental data conducted on the same body in towing tank, in terms of time average and RMS quantities. Different resolution and numerical/physical SPH algorithm parameters are investigated and the best combination leads to a good qualitative correlation with flow physics observed in the experiments. Quantitatively, when average and RMS values of the unsteady near field free surface elevation are compared, SPH results show a general good agreement with the experiments. The turbulent trailing edge separation and wave depression at midchord are well predicted, while a large deviation with the measurements is present in the bow region, where SPH values are in line with those obtained from RANS simulations.",

      "abstract": "The multi-fidelity machine learning framework proposed in this paper leverages a probabilistic approach based on Gaussian Process modeling for the formulation of stochastic response surfaces capable of describing propeller performance for different mission profiles. The proposed multi-fidelity techniques will help coping with the scarcity of high-fidelity measurements by using lower-fidelity numerical predictions. The existing correlation of the multi-fidelity data sets is used to infer high-fidelity measurements from lower fidelity numerical predictions. The probabilistic formulations embedded in Gaussian Process regressions gives the unique opportunity to learn the target functions describing propeller performance at different operating conditions, while quantifying the uncertainty associated to that specific prediction. While the multi-fidelity autoregressive scheme allows to construct high accurate response surfaces using only few experimental data, Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) provides an important metric to asses the quality of the learning process. We demonstrate the capability of the proposed framework to predict the performance of a controllable pitch propeller using few experimental data coming from towing tank experiments and many medium-fidelity predictions obtained using an in-house developed BEM, validated and verified in many previous studies.",

The objective of this work is to demonstrate that the multi-fidelity framework can be used efficiently to discover optimal small waterplane area twin hull shapes having superior seakeeping performance using a limited number of expensive high-fidelity simulations combined with a larger number of inexpensive low-fidelity simulations. Specifically, we employ multi-fidelity Gaussian process regression and Bayesian optimization to build probabilistic surrogate models and efficiently explore a 35-dimensional design space to optimize hull shapes that minimize wave-induced motions and accelerations, and satisfy specific requirements in terms of displacement and metacentric height. Our results demonstrate the superior characteristics of this optimization framework in constructing accurate surrogate models and identifying optimal designs with a significant reduction in the computational effort.",

      "abstract": "Techniques for shape representation and further modification of a hull surface definitely play a key role in both the design of new buildings and in the optimisation of the existing ones. The simplification of the methods is the goal to reach in order to create useful tools for real applications. A new approach for hull shape modification is proposed. It is based on a combination of the Subdivision Surface technique for hull surface modelling and Free Form Deformation for shape variation. The formal relation between the two methods is established by the Free Form Deformation control volume and the Subdivision Surface control polygon, introducing significant simplification to the definition of the transformation. The new approach is described in detail highlighting its benefits. Its effectiveness is finally proved by an example of application on a real hull shape, where a combination of a local and global modification has been analysed.",

Ship self-propulsion performance prediction represents one of the most interesting problems in this framework. The capabilities of CFD codes to resolve accurately the separate problems (open water propeller performance and hull resistance) have been demonstrated over the last decades. The complexity of the combined problem (and, in turn, the required computational time) has restricted its solution to research applications still far from everyday industrial practice. Some approaches have been developed to reduce the computational burden, based e.g. on simple actuator-disk theory or, recently, on BEM/RANS coupled solvers. In this respect, different approaches exploiting the open-source solver Open-FOAM are presented, focusing on the main self-propulsion parameters. In addition, a new numerical strategy able to provide more information compared to classical simplified approaches, is herein presented and validated against experimental measurements on the well-known Kriso Container Ship (KCS) test case.",

      "abstract": "In the international regulation framework, the energy-efficient operation of ships is becoming standard. In this respect, restrictions on new construction appear to encourage improvement to existing vessels often equipped with outdated technologies. One of the relevant aspects of propulsion plant design and fleet management is the propulsion need to accomplish the design requirements in a wide set of sea states or in conflicting operative conditions (e.g., laden/ballast, sailing/trawling), requiring very different performances. A preliminary assessment of the energy efficiency of the ship system is then crucial for optimizing both the operating costs and the impact on the sea environment. A new efficiency assessment method that includes engine fuel consumption evaluated by ad hoc statistic regressions and ship resistance in calm water and in waves computed by a 3-D boundary element method is proposed. An application to a hard-chine 18 m trawler is proposed as part of a wider decision support system or weather routing algorithm.",

      "abstract": "The paper presents a framework for set-based design under uncertainty and demonstrates its viability through designing a super-cavitating hydrofoil of an ultrahigh speed vessel. The framework achieves designs that safely meet the requirements as quantified precisely by superquantile measures of risk (s-risk) and reduces the complexity of design under uncertainty. S-risk ensures comprehensive and decision-theoretically sound assessment of risk and permits a decoupling of parametric uncertainty and surrogate (model) uncertainty. The framework is compatible with any surrogate building technique, but we illustrate it by developing for the first time risk-adaptive surrogates that are especially tailored to s-risk. The numerical results demonstrate the framework in a complex design case requiring multifidelity simulation.",

      "abstract": "Small Waterplane Area Twin Hulls (SWATHs) are known to have superior seakeeping performance but higher resistance compared to equivalent catamarans or mono-hulls. A way to improve their resistance characteristics is to use unconventional hull forms parametrically defined and optimized by CFD methods. This study builds on previous SWATH optimization studies proposing a comprehensive, systematic investigation on the effect of different shapes and canting angles of the struts. For the first time we demonstrate the importance of considering the shape of the strut that is fully parametrized in our study. The effect of the design speed on the best shape is addressed through a multi-objective optimization targeting the minimum total resistance at two very different speeds, namely the cruise and slow transfer speeds. Optimum hull shapes are discussed in terms of maximum resistance reduction, together with the predicted free waves patterns.",

In both cases open-source software have been chosen. The numerical solutions from the two proposed CFD methods are verified against experimental measurements. The systematic analysis is performed considering a prescribed motion of the wedge aiming to a better understanding of the effect of the model set-up on the prediction of both local and global field variables. Even if a both codes shows a high ability to capture the global physics of the problem, due to the strongly nonlinear dynamic of the body-flow interactions involved in impact problems, the local pressure peaks can be hardly predicted if the numerical method is not suitably tuned for the specific problem. Finally the two approaches are performed also for a free falling simulation, comparing the numerical predictions to the available experimental drop tests results.",

      "abstract": "A new viscous lifting-line method for three-dimensional supercavitating hydrofoils is presented. The method is designed to allow for the strong nonlinear hydrodynamic characteristic of two-dimensional supercavitating sections. These nonlinearities, manifesting as sudden variation of the sectional lift-curve slope, are included in the numerical model by the introduction of variable positions of the collocation points where the body boundary condition is enforced. The nonlinear hydrodynamic performance of the two-dimensional sections is predicted via multiphase Navier-Stokes computations. An iterative algorithm is necessary to converge on the three-dimensional hydrofoil performance measured in terms of lift and drag forces. The convergence properties of the method are verified, and it is validated via a systematic series of experiments on a three-dimensional hydrofoil, considering a wide range of angle of attack and cavitation numbers, which comprise very different cavitation regimes on both the front and the rear sides of the hydrofoil. Results of the viscous lifting-line model are compared with both experimental measurements in the cavitation tunnel and high-fidelity three-dimensional unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes computations. Findings of the validation study suggest that the proposed viscous lifting-line method can be applied toward predicting the hydrodynamic performance of three-dimensional hydrofoils in fully wet, partially cavitating, and supercavitating regimes and for planform aspect ratios that are as low as 1.",

      "abstract": "A computational framework to design a new family of unconventional supercavitating (SC) hydrofoils with optimized hydrodynamic performance is developed. A low-order boundary element method is used to solve for the steady potential flow over the hydrofoil predicting its hydrodynamic characteristics, including the vapor-cavity interface. Shape variations are obtained by an ad hoc parametrization scheme by composite B-spline curves whose control points represent the design variables to the hydrodynamic optimization problem. The accuracy of the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) tools is also preventively validated on the experimental characteristics of a conventional SC hydrofoil. A computational test case is performed to maximize the efficiency of a SC hydrofoil accounting for both shape and angle of attack variations. The new hydrofoil leads to 40% improvement on the lift over drag ratio compared to the initial reference shape. This result is confirmed by high-fidelity unsteady multiphase viscous solver.",

      "abstract": "Achieving the right balance between fixed and operating costs is a key but non-trivial task for optimizing the characteristics of a fleet of ships for a new trade at a very early stage of the design. A wide range of design choices as well as a significant number of uncertainties related to the operation of the fleet affects those two expense items. In the proposed analysis, operative uncertainties rising from rough sea conditions are taken into account in a Simulation Based Design (SBD) framework for fleet generation and evaluation. The costs-benefits analysis is aimed at understanding the effects of variations in the installed power and in the ship capacity on the overall fleet performances. These two major characteristics of the ship design (and, accordingly, of the fleet of ships realizing the trade) are introduced in the numerical model considering the sea margin and the nominal capacity as free design parameters instead of fixing them as commonly done in practice. From a design point of view, this corresponds to the introduction of two new variables, enlarging the dimensions of the design space to be explored, better than relaxing the boundaries of a simpler design space. The validity of this approach is demonstrated by a practical application to the design of a fleet of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) carriers. In this context, the effects of variations in the fuel price and in the voyage length on the optimal fleet characteristics are analyzed and the results are discussed in comparison to those coming from the reference scenario.",

      "abstract": "The hydrodynamic analysis of a new semi-small waterplane area twin hull (SWATH) suitable for various applications such as small and medium size passenger ferries is presented. This may be an attractive crossover configuration resulting from the merging of two classical shapes: a conventional SWATH and a fast catamaran. The final hull design exhibits a wedge-like waterline shape with the maximum beam at the stern; the hull ends with a very narrow entrance angle, has a prominent bulbous bow typical of SWATH vessels, and features full stern to arrange waterjet propellers. Our analysis aims to perform a preliminary assessment of the hydrodynamic performance of a hull with such a complex shape both in terms of resistance of the hull in calm water and seakeeping capability in regular head waves and compare the performance with that of a conventional SWATH. The analysis is performed using a boundary element method that was preliminarily validated on a conventional SWATH vessel.",

      "abstract": "In this work, the possible exploitation of fiber-reinforced composites in the context of maritime transportation of compressed natural gas (CNG) is investigated. In addition to a more conventional steel configuration, two different fiber materials, carbon and glass, are considered as construction materials for pressure vessels (PVs) to be stored on board ships, with thickness optimized by FEM analysis.The considered scenario is represented by the transportation of CNG from an offshore well to a terminal on shore. Fleets of ships carrying CNG in pressure vessels manufactured with the investigated materials are generated by means of a ship synthesis model (SSM) software and compared on the basis of technical and economical indicators.The choice of the construction material influences considerably the weight of the PVs, which represent a major item of total ship weight and reflects directly on the general transport performances in terms of resistance, seakeeping and reliability in the service. On the other hand, capital as well as operating expenditures are considerably affected by the choice. When exploring the design space, the ship synthesis model is able, at a preliminary stage of the design, to account for the various technical and economical aspects, their implications and relationships. Results are presented of computations carried out in a specific case, identified by the annual gas production and other characteristics of the well terminal and a cruising route for the ships. The comparison is carried out on the basis of the cost per transported unit of gas and of the percentage of success in the transportation process. The computations show that the choice of the PV material has a key influence on the results in terms of optimal number, dimensions and speed of the ships.",

      "abstract": "A new numerical approach based on the Vortex Lattice Method (VLM) for the solution of the hydrodynamic performances of cambered hulls in steady planing is formulated and validated. Due to its fully 3D formulation, the method can be applied to both cambered and un-cambered dihedral planing surfaces of any shape without any further approximation. The exact three-dimensional wetted surface of the hull is where the body boundary condition is fulfilled. The sprays region detaching both in front of the stagnation root line and from the wet portion of the chine are modeled in the numerical scheme by means of additional vortex lattice regions. The dynamic boundary condition at the stern of the hull is non-linear with respect to the perturbation potential. Results show the dynamic pressure consistently accounts for the 3D features of the flow especially in the case of cambered planing surfaces. The numerical method is verified by a systematic analysis against semi-empirical methods and it is finally validated with experimental results on prismatic as well as cambered dihedral planing surfaces. Excellent correlations are found for both types of planing surfaces that range in the same confidence interval of higher fidelity numerical models, such as RANSE solvers.",

The novelty is brought by the solution of the radiation problem for 2D ship sections forced to oscillate in calm water. This problem is solved using a fully viscous method with non-linear free surface based on the solution of RANS equations coupled with a VOF technique for the prediction of the free surface flow. The numerical grid is automatically generated around ship sections offsets using algorithms specifically designed for the solution of radiation problems. The viscous numerical solver is based on OpenFOAM libraries.A Fourier transformation technique finally leads to the definition of radiation forces in the frequency domain.A novel technique based on energy equivalence has been formulated and implemented in the method presented in this paper with the goal to recover higher harmonics of radiation forces captured with the fully-viscous non-linear free surface prediction model. The coupled numerical method is described in details in the paper. Also, the method has been verified on a series of successively refined grids and validated against experimental results on a classic mono-hull.",

      "abstract": "The energy efficiency evaluation of trawlers becomes more and more relevant as the trend of the government laws follows the path of restrictions to new constructions to encourage improvement to existing vessels, often equipped with outdated technologies. The two conditions a trawler need to meet during its operations, namely the sailing and the trawling phases, require in principle very different performances. Despite the higher speed reached when cruising from ports to fishing grounds, this type of ships experiences increased resistance as well as heavy loaded propellers during the trawling operations at low speed. In the light of the specific tasks of such a kind of vessel, a preliminary assessment of the energy efficiency of the ship-system is of crucial interest to optimize both the operating costs and the impact on the sea environment. In this context, hydrodynamic performances and the propulsion system have direct consequences on the fuel consumption, hence on the operational costs of the vessel. In the proposed model, the engine fuel consumption is evaluated by suitable statistic regression to account for the prime mover performance into the propulsion chain. Ship resistance in calm water and added resistance due to rough sea conditions are computed by a Boundary Element Method. Both are then integrated into the global efficiency assessment method. An application of energy efficiency assessment and optimization of a hard-chine 18 meters trawler is presented. The final results are shown as part of a wider decision support system to optimize the overall performance of the vessel operation in different environmental conditions.",

Scale model tests have been carried out at the towing tank of Genoa University, taking into account three displacements (full load and two lighter displacements) at five static-trim combinations (even keel, two trim values by bow and other two by stern). The motivations of the research arise from the considered ship type, because these kinds of experimental studies, for the examined hull form, are not readily available in the scientific literature. The experimental results are discussed in the light of the uncertainty analysis to evaluate the reliability of the measured data, to be used for the development of a decision support system aimed at a proper energy management of the full-scale vessel. As case study, the fuel consumption analysis is reported for a defined route, in order to assess the trim importance on the overall ship energy efficiency.",

      "abstract": "The transportation by sea of compressed natural gas is a very recent subject, prompted by recent changes in the perspectives of a possible economic exploitation of relatively small quantities of this hydrocarbon, available as by-product of oil extraction in off-shore fields. An automatic and integrated preliminary design procedure has been established to generate and evaluate feasible technical solutions for a trade of this kind. A first trial application has been carried out for a specific case, for which various feasible solutions corresponding to fleets composed of a different number of equal ships are generated. In the procedure, a parent hull shape is adopted in order to evaluate, through systematic variations of the main dimensions, all the elements necessary to perform the classical steps of the design spiral (like weight evaluation, buoyancy, trim and stability checks and motion resistance prediction) accounting for the mutual interaction between the various items. When possible and necessary, parts of the procedure have been calibrated with data from existing ships, in order to ensure realism in the predictions. This has been done with reference e.g. to the evaluation of weight items and in particular to hull weight. On the other hand, when setting boundaries to the range of variation in the ship dimensions, care has been given not to constrain the investigation domain only to existing dimensional ratios, but to let the procedure explore a wider range of solutions. A particular feature of the procedure is to include in the evaluation process the seakeeping performances in terms of added resistance in waves. This aspect interacts with the other part of the design process and influences the final outcome in terms of performance of the solution. The main implications of accounting for the increase in motion resistance are the capability of evaluating the reduction in the average speed, the corresponding reduction in the annual cargo delivery and the increase in fuel consumption (all aspects evaluated in respect to nominal conditions). The procedure, accordingly, is able to provide, in addition to several technical output identifying the various solutions (such as main dimensions, weight, power installed, seakeeping performances), indicators of the performances of the fleet in terms of annual cargo delivery, CapEx and OpEx, that can be used to rank the various solutions. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",

      "abstract": "A semi-SWATH (Small Waterplane Area Twin Hull) designed for littoral passenger transport service is optimized by a full automatic procedure with respect to seakeeping and resistance at different speeds. The computer assisted procedure is based on: A fully parametric model of the unconventional hull form, which guarantees ample shape changes while ensuring the fairness of the surfaces; on 3D linear Rankine sources panel method for the steady wave resistance and seakeeping problem; and on multi-objective global convergence genetic algorithms. Both global (length and demi-hull beam) and local shape variations are allowed in order to explore highly unconventional hull shapes. Interesting results are obtained from the optimization considering resistance at a single speed or two very different speeds and including or not the seakeeping merit functions. Considerable reductions of drag and vertical acceleration can be obtained from the optimization procedure in the order of 15% on drag at high speeds and 30% on vertical acceleration in most exposed passenger area.

      "abstract": "The paper presents the main characteristics of an innovative platform which has been conceived and designed to extend the operational capabilities of current unmanned surface vehicles in terms of platform stability in waves and of powering requirement at a relatively high speed. The main idea which rules the project is the realization of a small autonomous surface unit (about 6 m in length) capable of undertaking several tasks in the marine environment even with moderate rough sea conditions. The designed vessel has the ability to locate, recover, and launch other members of the autonomous fleet (like AUVs or other underwater devices) and at the same time could carry out a surveillance service of the surrounding areas. To manage these tasks, the vehicle is designed to provide a fairly good autonomy which is needed to face intermediate-range missions (100 nautical miles). The choice of a small waterplane area twin hull (SWATH) form has been motivated by its excellent properties of seakeeping qualities, combined with a non-conventional low resistance underwater hull shape, currently under patenting process, which is able to reduce to a minimum the resistance of the vessel especially at higher speeds. To obtain the most efficient profile of the underwater bodies, a systematic optimization with an automatic procedure based on a parametric definition of the geometry, a state-of-the-art computational fluid dynamics (CFD) flow solver, and a differential evolution global minimization algorithm have been created and used. As expected, all the final CFD computations on the best design have demonstrated the superior efficiency of the developed unconventional SWATH technology with respect to different alternatives of current hull typologies. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",

      "abstract": "In the paper a numerical procedure developed in a Matlab® environment is presented, aiming at the definition of the main dimensions of a fleet of ships devoted to the transportation of a bulk cargo. The procedure is meant to provide preliminary indication in the initial phase of feasibility studies. The optimal dimensions are defined through a full factorial analysis. Relevant input data are information about the cargo to be transported (annual quantity, specific gravity, etc.), about the characteristics of the plants needed for cargo handling (weight, dimension, location on board) and about the route. The algorithm is based on a preliminary design modulus which provides solutions in line with requirements and preliminarily checked as regards basic trim and stability requirements. The analysis includes, on the specific geometry considered, an evaluation of the seakeeping performances of the ship in the sea area covering the transportation route. The influence of adverse meteo-marine conditions reflects into an increase in the consumption and in a decrease in the average speed as compared with nominal values (in calm water). The inherent increase in running costs and the need for an incremented net weight nominal capacity to increase the probability of satisfying the specifications in terms of annual actual transportation flow is accounted for. A first set of results is presented, regarding a possible trade of Compressed Natural Gas in the North Sea area.",

A study about the automatic optimization of the fore hull forms of a fast frigate has been carried out. On the basis of a technical specification provided by the Italian Navy, the initial shape of the hull has been defined by means of an accurate preliminary design leading to a set of geometrical constraints for the optimization process. The fully automatic optimization chain has been implemented adopting the ModeFrontier optimization environment to interface the Friendship-Framework (parametric definition of the hull shape), the CFD codes developed by CETENA S.p.A. (to predict the steady wave resistance and unsteady seakeeping performances of each design candidate), and a MOGA genetic algorithm. Numerical results have been validated by means of calm water model tests performed at the Towing Tank of the Department of Naval Architecture and Electrical Engineering (DINAEL) of the University of Genoa. Notwithstanding the rather high number of constraints, which limit geometry variations, it was possible to obtain an optimal solution, and results have been confirmed by the experimental tests.",

The focus is concentrated on the prediction of the hydrodynamic characteristics and the optimization methods used to design the hull forms in order to minimize the propulsion power at the operational speed of the vehicles.For both vessels a modern automatic parametric optimization computer-based procedure has been developed and RANSE calculations performed to validate the final design. The second vessel is a hybrid SWATH, capable of reaching a top speed of 120 knots in the foil-born mode, at which four super-cavitating hydrofoils are folded down into the water. Main issues related to the design of surfacepiercing super-cavitating hydrofoils, for operation at such a high speed, are presented and discussed on the basis of the results obtained through CFD simulations and feedback from preliminary results of model tests in a cavitation tunnel.",
