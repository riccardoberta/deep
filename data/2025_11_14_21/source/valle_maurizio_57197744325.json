      "abstract": "Intelligent sensing systems are increasingly used in wearable devices, enabling advanced tasks across various application domains including robotics and human–machine interaction. Ensuring these systems are energy autonomous is highly demanded, despite strict constraints on power, memory and processing resources. To meet these requirements, embedded neural networks must be optimized to achieve a balance between accuracy and efficiency. This paper presents an integrated approach that combines Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) with optimization techniques—weight reshaping, quantization, and their combination—to develop efficient classifiers for a multisensory glove. HW-NAS automatically derives 1D-CNN models tailored to the NUCLEO-F401RE board, while the additional optimization further reduces model size, memory usage, and latency. Across three datasets, the optimized models not only improve classification accuracy but also deliver an average reduction of 75% in inference time, 69% in flash memory, and more than 45% in RAM compared to NAS-only baselines. These results highlight the effectiveness of integrating NAS with optimization techniques, paving the way towards energy-autonomous wearable systems.",

We examined both the number of floating operations for modeling the receptors, and the number of synaptic operations for recurrent spiking neural networks (RSNNs) used in classification. Results show that deeper receptors (Type-II) require a greater computational cost to be modeled than those close to the surface (Type-I). However, RSNNs linked with deeper receptors exhibit a lower cost. We evaluated the energy consumption of the modeling and classification parts, each on its dedicated hardware device. The results suggest that pairing Type-I receptors with their corresponding RSNNs offers the best trade-off between energy consumption and classification accuracy.",

      "abstract": "During muscle contractions, force distributions are generated on muscle surfaces due to muscle activity, which is applicable for control in a Human-Machine Interface. It has been proven that the force distribution from the corresponding body motions can be recorded utilizing so-called Force Myography (FMG). Flexible piezoelectric sensors with attractive sensing properties have been widely used in several areas to detect force variations through wearable devices. In this paper, we developed an FMG armband composed of high-density (24 sensors) piezoelectric electronic skin and multi-channel embedded electronics. The FMG armband was used to recognize eleven hand and wrist gestures performed by able-bodied subjects. To do this, two signal-processing approaches (Front-End Approach (EEA) and Feature-based Approach (FBA)) were developed to process the FMG patterns and extract the proper features. The processed FMG patterns were evaluated and identified by employing various classical machine learning algorithms, and an average gesture recognition accuracy of 98% for wrist gestures was obtained. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of using high-density piezoelectric skin for FMG and leads to alternative methods for gesture recognition in biomedical applications.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents the implementation of machine learning algorithms on GAP9 for real-time tactile data processing. The case study is object recognition based on multisensory glove data. A shallow 1D-CNN model was employed to first process the data, then deployed in the GAP SDK simulation environment (GVSoC), and various metrics were extracted to evaluate the GAP9 in this task. The results showed a latency of 85.37 μs. Additionally, memory profiling showed that no clock cycles were wasted waiting for pure I/O operations, since the model was allocated 23.98kB (20.7%) of the L1 cache and 13.96kB (1.07%) of L2 without any need for buffering between caches or external memory access operations. The GAP9, using our model, has a dynamic energy consumption of 6.76 pJ per inference. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, opening up an interesting perspective for various biomedical applications.",

The system is mounted on the fingertip of the Hannes prosthetic hand, which obtains the texture and hardness features by grasping daily-life objects. Time-domain features are extracted from the sensor's response and evaluated through the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. Additionally, two deep learning (DL) algorithms including One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1-D CNN) and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) were implemented. Results demonstrated that the 1-D CNN attained the highest recognition accuracy 90% ≈ for both hardness and texture. Moreover, it demonstrated that the hardness information is integrated into the full grasp action, while the texture information can be extracted using the first contact with the object. Deploying the 1-D CNN into a microcontroller proved that the system is energy efficient and capable of extracting tactile information in real-time. This study demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed system in recognizing object properties highlighting its robustness and suitability for developing prosthetics.",

      "abstract": "Artificial tactile sensing systems have gained significant attention in recent years due to their potential to enhance human-machine interaction. Numerous initiatives have been introduced to shift the computational paradigms of these systems toward a more biologically inspired approach, by incorporating neuromorphic computing methods. Despite the significant advances made by these systems, dependence on complex offline methods for classification (i.e., hand-crafted encoding features) remains a limitation for their real-time deployment. In this work, we present a neuromorphic tactile P(VDF-TrFE) poly(vinylidene fluoride trifluoroethylene)-based (PVDF) sensing system for textural features classification, that employs raw signals directly for classification. We first converted raw signals into spikes and then trained recurrent spiking neural networks (RSNNs) using backpropagation through time (BPTT) with surrogate gradients to perform classification. We proposed an optimization method based on tuning the refractory period of the encoding neurons, to explore a potential trade-off between the computational cost and the classification accuracy of the RSNN. The proposed method effectively identified two RSNNs with refractory period configurations that achieved a trade-off between the two evaluation metrics. Following this, we reduced the inference time steps of the selected RSNN during inference using a rate-coding-based method. This method succeeded in saving around 26.6% out of the total original time steps. In summary, the proposed system paves the way for establishing an end-to-end neuromorphic approach for tactile textural features classification, by deploying the selected RSNNs on a dedicated neuromorphic hardware device for real-time inferences.",

Range-Doppler maps extracted from a low-cost frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar are fed into a deep neural network. The system is deployed on an edge device. The results show that the system can recognize five human actions with an accuracy of 93.2% and an inference time of 2.95 s. Raising an alarm when a harmful action happens is a crucial feature in an indoor safety application. Thus, the performance during the binary classification, i.e., fall vs nonfall actions, is also assessed, achieving an accuracy of 96.8% with a false-negative rate of 4%. To find the best tradeoff between accuracy and computational cost, the energy precision ratio of the system deployed on the edge is measured. The system achieves a 1.04 energy precision ratio value, where an ideal ratio would be close to zero.",

The system's objective is to enhance proprioceptive capabilities in robotics, enabling precise object manipulation by accurately detecting and interpreting forces applied to joints. Two CNN architectures are proposed and evaluated: one that processes combined accelerometer and gyroscope data, and another that processes these data separately before combining the extracted features. Both approaches were deployed on a low-power STM32F401 microcontroller, demonstrating effective real-time performance. The first approach achieved a classification accuracy of 88.6%, while the second achieved 87.9%, with both approaches consuming approximately 21 mJ per inference.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes a low-cost multisensory glove (≈ 140 USD) equipped with commercial piezoresistive force sensors (FSRs) and inertial measurement units (IMUs) for object recognition. A set of 28 daily life objects is used to evaluate the glove by applying grasping actions. The raw signals acquired through these actions are employed directly to train a shallow one-dimensional convolutional neural network. The network is deployed on a low-cost edge system to perform online object recognition, thereby presenting an end-to-end system. The proposed system achieves a classification accuracy of 99.29% while consuming only 59.85 mW and 0.4875 mJ of power and energy per inference respectively. Overall, the proposed system seems a suitable candidate for various biomedical applications such as post-stroke rehabilitation.",

      "abstract": "A prosthetic device replicating the human hand capabilities is very challenging to achieve, not only for the intrinsic nature of the very complex movements, anthropomorphism, and aesthetics but also for the sophisticated capabilities that its net of receptors offers from the somatosensory perspective. Therefore, providing seamless human hand capabilities in a single device is still an open topic. Hannes Hand prosthesis exemplifies advancements in prosthetic technology, and, for this research activity, a preliminary integration of P(VDF-TrFE) piezoelectric sensors enhances novel tactile sensing capabilities. This study focuses on the sensorization of the Hannes Hand, aiming to bridge the gap between human hand functionalities and prosthetic performance. We present a preliminary implementation of sensor arrays embedded within the prosthetic glove, ensuring high sensitivity and responsiveness. Our approach aims at emphasizing sensor fusion toward the development of comprehensive feedback and intuitive control. Through a preliminary comparison analysis with human mechanoreceptors, we highlight the effectiveness of our piezoelectric sensors in replicating rapid adaptive behaviours, crucial for dynamic interaction with the environment.",

Various statistical features were extracted and evaluated through machine learning algorithms including support vector machines (SVM), single-layer feed-forward neural networks, and k-nearest neighbor (KNN). Five hardness objects were examined by performing indentation experiments using a Cartesian robot equipped with the sensing system while varying the indentation speed and load. Results showed that the SVM classifier trained on features ranked using principal component analysis (PCA) achieves a discrimination accuracy of 96% while utilizing a single sensor. Furthermore, results demonstrated that fixing the indentation speed and load increases the discrimination accuracy to 100%. This study demonstrated the capability of the tactile sensing system in extracting tactile information opening up interesting perspectives for wearable sensing and soft robots.",

Various time and frequency features were extracted and evaluated through ML algorithms, including support vector machines (SVM), single-layer feed-forward neural networks, and 1-D convolution neural networks. Six naturalistic surface textures were explored by simply sliding the index finger of seven participants on the surfaces with and without the tactile glove. Results showed that by employing an SVM classifier trained on both time and frequency features, a discrimination accuracy of 87% is achieved while utilizing only two sensors.

He designed one of the first chips in an Italian university and then a set of digital system architectures that contributed to shaping the then-fledgling field of microprocessors. Also, by founding the Applepies conference (International Conference on Applications in Electronics Pervading Industry, Environment and Society), he promoted the intuition of the value for the whole population of the applications of electronic systems. He pioneered the field of mobile apps and started a fruitful dialogue with the humanistic culture, particularly exploiting virtual reality technologies. In the last few years, he also contributed to machine learning and big data, particularly in the domain of automated driving. He founded an MSc program on strategy, intending to shape education in that field from a rigorous engineering point of view. We believe that his generous and enthusiastic academic life can be an outstanding example in the face of today’s challenges of Electronic Engineering and higher education in the broader societal context.",

      "abstract": "Robotic grippers can be equipped with tactile sensing systems to extract information from a manipulated object. The real-time classification of the physical properties of a grasped object on resource-constrained devices requires efficient and effective pre-processing techniques and machine-learning (ML) algorithms. In this paper, we propose a tactile sensing system mounted on the Baxter robot for the hardness classification of objects. In particular, we pre-processed the raw data with low computational cost techniques, and we designed three ML algorithms to provide real-time, energy-efficient, and low-memory impact classification on a resource-constrained microcontroller. Results show that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) achieve the best accuracy (>98%), while the support vector machine (SVM) presents the lowest memory occupation (1576 bytes), inference time (<0.077ms), and energy consumption (<5.74μJ).",

In our experiment, 15 human-participants were asked to use manual gesture-based navigation in a VR scene that allowed them to change the virtual-to-real scale of the virtual world and perform a simple pick-and-place task in supervised robot control mode. We have compared the virtual world scale of participants at the beginning of a 3-day experiment when they were considered to be novice teleoperators and at the end of it when they were considered to be expert teleoperators. Expert teleoperators as a group used a smaller virtual world scale that allowed them to perform the experimental task faster than novices, although this behaviour was not exhibited by every teleoperator individually. Our study also demonstrated that participants' prior video gaming experience affects the virtual world scale as participants with video gaming experience used smaller virtual world scales and performed the experimental task faster.",

The optical link features a low power and wide transmission bandwidth, which makes the feedback system suitable for a large number and variety of tactile sensors. The low-power transmission is derived from the employed UWB-based optical modulation technique. A system prototype, consisting of digital transmitter and receiver boards and acquisition circuits to interface 32 piezoelectric sensors, was implemented and experimentally tested. The system functionality was demonstrated by processing and transmitting data from the piezoelectric sensor at a 100 Mbps data rate through the optical link, measuring a communication energy consumption of 50 pJ/bit. The reported experimental results validate the functionality of the proposed sensory feedback system and demonstrate its real-time operation capabilities.",

The implementation choices for the RSNN are limited to hardware-friendly models since it is intended to be integrated into an electronic skin system. Hence, a comparison between the von-Neumman and neuromorphic computing approaches has been assessed in terms of hardware efficiency. The energy consumption per inference of the proposed model is estimated using the KerasSpiking tool built-in NengoDL framework, on three different devices namely: GPU, Intel Loihi, and SpiNNaker. The obtained results indicate that the aforementioned neuromorphic devices achieve several orders of magnitude gains in energy over von-Neumman hardware. Moreover, the proposed RSNN model overcomes similar state-of-the-art solutions in terms of classification accuracy and hardware complexity making it a promising candidate for embedded electronic skin applications.",

      "abstract": "The deployment of the inference phase in self–standing systems, which have resource–constrained embedded units, is faced with many challenges considering computational cost of the elaboration unit. Therefore, we propose using a learning strategy based on a loss function that leads to finding the best configuration of the prediction model balancing the generalization performance and the computational cost of the whole elaboration system. We validate our proposal by integrating a tactile sensing system on a Baxter robot to collect and classify data from five daily–life objects using four different algorithms. Results show that the best performance, when the computational cost is not relevant, is achieved by the fully–connected neural network using 16 features, while, when the computational cost matters, the loss function showed that the kernel SVM with 4 features has the best performance.",

      "abstract": "Smart tactile sensing system has been a subject of research in many application domains such as prosthetics and robotics. Embedding signal pre-processing methods (i.e., filters) along with processing algorithms (i.e., machine learning) into miniaturized electronic units enhance the extraction of high-bandwidth information (e.g., slippage detection). However, it is challenging due to the high computational costs and the real time requirements. This paper proposes a lightweight implementation of pre-processing method for multichannel tactile sensing system. We targeted two filtering methods, Finite Impulse Response (FIR) and Exponential Moving Average Filter (EMAF). The paper presents the analysis of the implementation performance on hardware i.e., number of clock cycles, execution time and touch detection accuracy. Experimental results show that EMAF is more effective than FIR when it comes to the hardware complexity. This means that the computational cost for implementing such pre-processing filter is negligible and thus acceptable for time, and hardware constraint tactile sensing system.",

      "abstract": "Tactile sensing has become crucial in robotic applications such as teleoperation, as it gives information about the object properties that cannot be perceived by other senses. In fact, it is essential that robots are equipped with advanced touch sensing in order to be aware of their surroundings and give a feedback to an operator. Such sensing systems are made of sensors and an elaboration unit that acquires tactile signals and process the data, retrieving information such as texture, hardness, and shape. In this paper, we propose a novel tactile sensing system made of flexible, high sensitive and high spatial resolution piezoelectric polyvinylidene fluoride‐trifluoroethylene P(VDF-TrFE) sensors, and a low power and low cost Interface Electronics (IE) that can acquire data from 32 channels simultaneously with a sampling frequency of 2KSamples/s. We validate the system acquiring data from three different objects to classify their hardness using an artificial neural network of one hidden layer with approximately 89% accuracy. The signal processing and the classifier will be hosted by the IE in the next future.",

Bluetooth-based solutions for indoor localization have become increasingly popular in recent years. In addition to its availability (e.g., BLE is available on most modern smart devices), Bluetooth Low Energy technology is an economical and simple solution to the industry. To the best of our knowledge, none of the existing indoor localization systems use both Angle of Arrival and Received Signal Strength Indication. This paper presents the experimental assessment of a single device localization system that uses Angle of Arrival and Received Signal Strength Indication for localization of moving targets using Bluetooth. The results demonstrate that the developed system is an important step towards a new generation of real-time indoor localization systems that can locate targets with high accuracy (e.g., AoA accuracy: 89.2%), and an improvement concerning the cost of the implementation.",

      "abstract": "Tactile object shapes are considered as important properties in robotic manipulation. Many researches have focused recently on using tactile sensing systems to enable tactile information processing in robotics. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are emerging as promising methods alternative to deep learning due to their ability to process information in an event-driven manner. In this paper, we propose a SNN architecture and hardware implementation for tactile object shapes recognition. The network is fed by an array of 160 piezoresistive tactile sensors where the object shapes are applied. Results demonstrate that the proposed system is able to discriminate the tactile object shapes with 100% accuracy on unseen data having time steps up to 0.1 ms. Moreover, the network has been implemented on a Raspberry Pi platform achieving real time classification.",

In our system, a human-operator uses a remotely controlled robot-manipulator with an optical fibre-based tactile and proximity sensor to scan surfaces of objects in a remote environment. Tactile and proximity data and the robot's end-effector state feedback are used for the classification of objects' materials which are then visualized in the VR reconstruction of the remote environment for each object. Machine learning techniques such as random forest, convolutional neural and multi-modal convolutional neural networks were used for material classification. The proposed system and methods were tested with five different materials and classification accuracy of 90 % and more was achieved. The results of material classification were successfully exploited for visualising the remote scene in the VR interface to provide more information to the human-operator.",

The available tactile feedback interfaces comprise few sensing and stimulation units, which limits the amount of information conveyed to the user. The present study describes a novel technology that relies on distributed sensing and stimulation to convey comprehensive tactile feedback to the user of a robotic end effector. The system comprises six flexible sensing arrays (57 sensors) integrated on the fingers and palm of a robotic hand, embedded electronics (64 recording channels), a multichannel stimulator and seven flexible electrodes (64 stimulation pads) placed on the volar side of the subject s hand. The system was tested in seven subjects asked to recognize contact positions and identify contact sliding on the electronic skin, using distributed anode configuration (DAC) and single dedicated anode configuration. The experiments demonstrated that DAC resulted in substantially better performance. Using DAC, the system successfully translated the contact patterns into electrotactile profiles that the subjects could recognize with satisfactory accuracy (i.e. median{IQR} of 88.6{11}% for static and 93.3{5}% for dynamic patterns).

      "abstract": "In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of approximate computing techniques (ACTs) in the embedded Support Vector Machine (SVM) tensorial kernel circuit implementation in tactile sensing systems. Improving the performance of the embedded SVM in terms of power, area, and delay can be achieved by implementing approximate multipliers in the SVD. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is the main computational bottleneck of the tensorial kernel approach; since digital multipliers are extensively used in SVD implementation, we aim to optimize the implementation of the multiplier circuit. We present the implementation of the approximate SVD circuit based on the Approximate Baugh-Wooley (Approx-BW) multiplier. The approximate SVD achieves an energy consumption reduction of up to 16% at the cost of a Mean Relative Error decrease (MRE) of less than 5%. We assess the impact of the approximate SVD on the accuracy of the classification; showing that approximate SVD increases the Error rate (Err) within a range of one to eight percent. Besides, we propose a hybrid evaluation test approach that consists of implementing three different approximate SVD circuits having different numbers of approximated Least Significant Bits (LSBs). The results show that energy consumption is reduced by more than five percent with the same accuracy loss.",

      "abstract": "Wearable systems require resource-constrained embedded devices for the elaboration of the sensed data. These devices have to host energy-efficient artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to output information to a human user. In this regard, the single-layer feed-forward neural networks (SLFNNs) proved to be very effective for deployment on very low-end devices. SLFNNs showed promising results when the goal was to balance the trade-off between accuracy and predictor complexity. Nevertheless, the elaboration system, which consists of data pre-processing and features extraction stages, affects the resource occupancy, computational cost, and also eventual generalization performance. In this paper, we propose a learning strategy based on the out-of-samples technique that leads to finding the configurations of the elaboration unit and the parameters of the predictor that best balance the generalization accuracy and the computational cost of the whole system. An intensive study over the touch modalities classification problem shows that the best solution in terms of the only accuracy is achieved by the SLFNNs, outperforming existing algorithms. Moreover, the learning procedure selects the configuration of the processing and features extraction stages, and the parameters of the predictor that present the best trade-off between generalization performance and computational cost.",

When validated on a touch modality classification problem, the NN-based TSVM implementation has achieved a real-time operation while consuming about 88% less energy per classification than the Jacobi-based TSVM with an accuracy loss of at most 3%.

      "abstract": "As the technology moves towards more human-like bionic limbs, it is necessary to develop a feedback system that provides active touch feedback to a user of a prosthetic hand. Most of the contemporary sensory substitution methods comprise simple position and force sensors combined with few discrete stimulation units, and hence they are characterized with a limited amount of information that can be transmitted by the feedback. The present study describes a novel system for tactile feedback integrating advanced multipoint sensing (electronic skin) and stimulation (matrix electrodes). The system comprises a flexible sensing array (16 sensors) integrated on the index finger of a Michelangelo prosthetic hand mockup, embedded interface electronics and multichannel stimulator connected to a flexible matrix electrode (24 pads). The developed system conveys contact information (binary detections) to the user. To demonstrate the feasibility, the system was tested in six able-bodied subjects who were asked to recognize static patterns (contact position) with two different spatial resolutions and dynamic movement patterns (i.e., sliding along and/or across the finger) presented on the electronic skin. The experiments demonstrated that the system successfully translated the mechanical interaction into electrotactile profiles, which the subjects could recognize with good performance. The success rates (mean pm standard deviation) for the static patterns were 91 pm 4% and 58 pm 10% for low and high spatial resolution, respectively, while the success rate for sliding touch was 94 pm 4%. These results demonstrate that the developed system is an important step towards a new generation of tactile feedback interfaces that can provide high-bandwidth connection between the user and his/her bionic limb. Such systems would allow mimicking spatially distributed natural feedback, thereby facilitating the control and embodiment of the artificial device into the user body scheme.",

      "abstract": "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are mainly designed to deal with sequence prediction problems and they show their effectiveness in processing data originally represented as time series. This paper investigates the time series characteristics of RNNs to classify touch modalities represented as spatio temporal 3D tensor data. Different approaches are followed in order to propose efficient RNN models aimed at tactile data classification. The main idea is to capture long-term dependence from data that can be used to deal with long sequences represented by employing Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architectures. Moreover, a case specific approach to dataset organization of the 3D tensor data is presented. The target is to provide efficient hardware-friendly touch modality classification approaches suitable for embedded applications. To this end, the proposed work achieves effective performance in terms of hardware complexity by reducing the FLOPS by 99.98% and the memory storage by 98.34%, with respect to the state-of-art solutions on the same benchmark dataset. This directly affects the time latency and energy consumption of the embedded hardware. Besides, the implemented models shows a classification accuracy higher than those state-of-art solutions. Results demonstrate that the proposed computing architecture is scalable showing acceptable complexity when the system is scaled up in terms of input matrix size and number of classes to be recognized.",

The kNN architecture has been designed using High-Level Synthesis (HLS) and implemented on the Xilinx Zynqberry platform. Compared to similar state-of-The-Art implementations, the proposed kNN provides speedups between $1.4\\times $ and $875\\times $ with 41% to 94% reductions in energy consumption. To further enhance the proposed architecture, algorithmic-level Approximate Computing Techniques (ACTs) have been applied. The proposed approximate kNN implementation accelerates the classification process by $2.3\\times $ with an average reduced area size of 56% for a real-Time tactile data processing case study.

      "abstract": "Artificial tactile systems can facilitate the life of people suffering from a loss of the sense of touch. These systems use sensors and digital, battery-operated embedded units for data processing. Therefore, low-power, resource-constrained devices should host those embedded devices. The paper presents a framework based on 1-D convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which tackles the problem of classifying touch modalities, while limiting the number of architecture parameters. The paper also considers the computational cost of the pre-processing stage that handles tactile-sensor data before classification. The related pre-processing unit affects resources occupancy, computational cost, and ultimately classification accuracy. The experimental session involved a state-of-the-art real-world dataset containing three touch modalities. The 1-D CNN outperformed existing solutions in terms of accuracy, and showed a satisfactory trade-off between accuracy, computational cost, and resources occupancy. The implementation of the 1-D CNN classifier on an Arduino Nano 33 BLE device yielded real-time performances.",

      "abstract": "We explored rate mode control for virtual reality (VR) based robot teleoperation with constant and variable mapping of the human-operator's joystick position to the speed (rate) of the robot's end-effector. The variable mapping depended on the visual scale of the virtual reconstruction of the remote environment to the scale of the real remote environment. We demonstrated how the rate mode control and variable scaling based on the VR reconstruction scale can be efficiently used for seated VR based robot teleoperation when the operator's arms are supported to reduce tiredness. The experimental study with five human participants demonstrated that variable mapping allowed participants to teleoperate the robot more effectively, by adjusting the VR visual scale albeit at a cost of increased perceived workload.",

      "abstract": "Robots and users of hand prosthesis could easily manipulate objects if endowed with the sense of touch. Towards this goal, information about touched objects and surfaces has to be inferred from raw data coming from the sensors. An important cue for objects discrimination is the orientation of edges, that is used both in artificial vision and touch as pre-processing stage. We present a spiking neural network, inspired on the encoding of edges in human first order tactile afferents. The network uses three layers of Leaky Integrate and Fire neurons to distinguish different edge orientations of a bar pressed on the artificial skin of the iCub robot. The architecture is successfully able to discriminate eight different orientations (from 0<sup>o</sup> to 180<sup>o</sup>), by implementing a structured model of overlapping receptive fields. We demonstrate that the network can learn the appropriate connectivity through unsupervised spike based learning, and that the number and spatial distribution of sensitive areas within the receptive fields are important in edge orientation discrimination.",

The high computational complexity of the ML algorithms makes challenging the embedded implementation of tactile data processing. This paper proposes a complexity optimized tensorial-based machine learning algorithm for touch modality classification. The aim is to introduce an efficient algorithm minimizing the system complexity in terms of number of operations and memory storage which directly affect time latency and power consumption. With respect to the state of the art, the proposed approach reduces the number of operations per inference from 545 M-ops to 18 M-ops and the memory storage from 52.2 KB to 1.7 KB. Moreover, the proposed method speeds up the inference time by a factor of 43× at a cost of only 2% loss in accuracy.",

      "abstract": "This issue of the IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems (JETCAS) includes the highlighted papers from the 2nd IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence Circuits and Systems (AICAS 2020), which was originally planned to be held at the Centro Congressi Porto Antico in Genoa, Italy, on March 23-25, 2020. However, due to the difficult pandemic situation that the world was living during those days, the conference was postponed to August 31-September 4, 2020, and was finally held as a fully virtual event. Despite those difficulties, the conference was a great success in terms of participation which demonstrated the consolidation of the IEEE Circuits and Systems Society (CASS) community interested in the research and advances of new circuits and systems paradigms and hardware platforms that can boost a new generation of more efficient Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems and may enlarge the AI application scenarios and performances. The AI revolution is promising to incorporate the AI computing power to all industrial and social sectors. To make this trend possible, new computing platforms suited to efficiently support AI emerging algorithms, systems, and applications in different scenarios (from cloud servers to edge and autonomous devices) should be developed at a parallel pace. The IEEE AICAS conference has appeared and it is being consolidated as an international forum to communicate state-of-the-art research, innovation, and development results and advances in AI circuits and systems. It is an ideal forum to join efforts and exchange experiences between different international communities from academia and industry boosting the progress of AI circuits and systems.",

      "abstract": "Mimicking some of the remarkable characteristics of the human skin, including high sensitivity, mechanical flexibility, stretchability, and biodegradability has been one of the highly innovative research topics in both academia and industry for at least the last 30 years. Recent advances have fostered the development of artificial tactile sensing systems and opened up new opportunities for building electronic skin (e-skin) in applications such as robotics, prosthetics, and human-machine interfaces. Current tactile sensing systems have demonstrated high performance, low-cost, and ease of fabrication. However, profound issues remain unresolved and require strong interdisciplinary efforts to tackle them. This chapter primarily focuses on the strategies and technologies for the exploitation of e-skins in reconstructing tactile information. The chapter introduces the human sense of touch along with the physiology of the human skin and provides a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art tactile sensors. Additionally, the chapter highlights the latest breakthroughs and recent advances in the e-skins and artificial tactile sensing systems for robotic and prosthetics applications. Major technical details of transduction mechanisms in the e-skins such as piezoresistivity, capacitance, and piezoelectricity are described with their merits and demerits. Finally, requirements, challenges, improvements, and future perspectives that tactile sensing technologies need to address are reported.",

Moreover, this chapter provides guidelines for selecting appropriate hardware platforms for the algorithm’s implementation.

A touch modality classification problem is addressed as a case study: FPGA implementations of two algorithms k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are detailed and analyzed. Both algorithms provided real-time classification consuming 236mW and 1.14W, respectively. Such results can be improved with the use of approximate computing techniques that provide a trade-off between performance and hardware resources usage.

      "abstract": "The electronic (e-skin) system usually hosts many sensors coupled to an embedded electronic computing unit (ECU). The ECU extracts information by employing usually complex computing methods, e.g. machine learning (ML). Embedding ML algorithms poses challenges in terms of hardware resources and energy consumption because of (1) the high amount of data to be processed and (2) the computationally demanding computing methods. Leveraging on the trade-off between quality requirements versus computational complexity and time latency could reduce the system complexity without affecting the performance. In this chapter, we present the state-of-theart approximate computing techniques (ACTs) employed at the circuit level for embedded ML algorithms and we prove the feasibility of the ACTs in the e-skin systems. Approximate arithmetic circuits, mainly multipliers and adders, are implemented in the embedded ML algorithms to enhance their efficiency. Approximate circuits can reduce the hardware complexity up to 16% at a cost of accuracy loss less than 5%.",

First, the chapter starts with a definition of the e-skin system highlighting its importance in different domains. Then, it describes how the e-skin system is integrated into humanoid robotics namely in the iCub robot [1]. After that, we present how the use of e-skin systems may enable new technologies reporting the case of its use in telemanipulation [2]. Finally, an example for the use of the e-skin system to restore the sense of touch in prosthetic devices [3] is provided.

      "abstract": "Modern prosthetic arms and hands are sophisticated robotic devices that can provide some of the motor functions lost due to an amputation. However, none of the commonly used commercial systems restores somatosensory feedback to its user. In principle, the latter can be achieved by recording data from prosthesis sensors and conveying this information by stimulating the sensory structures of the amputee using invasive and noninvasive interfaces. Many such systems have been presented in the literature with promising results; however, they all rely on using only a few discrete stimulation points to transmit information and hence suffer from a limited information bandwidth. In this chapter, we propose a novel concept of a high-bandwidth feedback interface that relies on advanced sensing and stimulation to convey a large amount of information to the prosthesis user. The interface comprises an artificial skin covering the prosthesis with a dense network of tactile sensors (taxels) and a compact stimulation device delivering electrical current pulses through a matrix electrode with many conductive pads. The state-ofthe- art in the two technologies that are required for the implementation of the proposed concept are reviewed. This includes biomimetic e-skins that are suitable for the application in a wearable scenario, stimulation systems integrating a demultiplexing circuit to distribute electrical pulses, and flexible electrodes that can be produced with arbitrary shape, size, and distribution of conductive pads. Finally, the challenges in selecting feedback variables (raw signals versus high-level features) and mapping of these variables into stimulation parameters are addressed.",

      "abstract": "This work describes a virtual reality (VR) based robot teleoperation framework which relies on scene visualization from depth cameras and implements human-robot and human-scene interaction gestures. We suggest that mounting a camera on a slave robot's end-effector (an in-hand camera) allows the operator to achieve better visualization of the remote scene and improve task performance. We compared experimentally the operator's ability to understand the remote environment in different visualization modes: single external static camera, in-hand camera, in-hand and external static camera, in-hand camera with OctoMap occupancy mapping. The latter option provided the operator with a better understanding of the remote environment whilst requiring relatively small communication bandwidth. Consequently, we propose suitable grasping methods compatible with the VR based teleoperation with the in-hand camera. Video demonstration: https://youtu.be/3vZaEykMS-E.",

      "abstract": "Stroke patients suffer from impairments of both motor and somatosensory functions. The functional recovery of upper extremities is one of the primary goals of rehabilitation programs. Additional somatosensory deficits limit sensorimotor function and significantly affect its recovery after the neuromotor injury. Sensory substitution systems, providing tactile feedback, might facilitate manipulation capability, and improve patient's dexterity during grasping movements. As a first step toward this aim, we evaluated the ability of healthy subjects in exploiting electrotactile feedback on the shoulder to determine the number of perceived stimuli in numerosity judgment tasks. During the experiment, we compared four different stimulation patterns (two simultaneous: short and long, intermittent and sequential) differing in total duration, total energy, or temporal synchrony. The experiment confirmed that the subject ability to enumerate electrotactile stimuli decreased with increasing the number of active electrodes. Furthermore, we found that, in electrotactile stimulation, the temporal coding schemes, and not total energy or duration modulated the accuracy in numerosity judgment. More precisely, the sequential condition resulted in significantly better numerosity discrimination than intermittent and simultaneous stimulation. These findings, together with the fact that the shoulder appeared to be a feasible stimulation site to communicate tactile information via electrotactile feedback, can serve as a guide to deliver tactile feedback to proximal areas in stroke survivors who lack sensory integrity in distal areas of their affected arm, but retain motor skills.",

      "abstract": "Among most challenging open issues in prosthetic research is the development of a robust bidirectional interface between a prosthesis and its user. Commercially available prosthetic systems are mechanically advanced, but they do not provide somatosensory feedback. Here, we present a novel non-invasive interface for multichannel electrotactile feedback, comprising a matrix of 24 pads, and we investigate the ability of able-bodied human subjects to localize the electrotactile stimulus delivered through the matrix. For this purpose, we tested conventional stimulation (same frequency for all pads) and a novel dual-parameter modulation scheme (interleaved frequency and intensity) designed to facilitate the spatial localization over the electrode. Electrotactile stimulation was also compared to mechanical stimulation of the same locations on the skin. Experimental results on eight able-bodied subjects demonstrated that the proposed interleaved coding substantially improved the spatial localization compared to same-frequency stimulation. The results also showed that same-frequency stimulation was equivalent to mechanical stimulation, whereas the performance with dual-parameter modulation was significantly better. These are encouraging outcomes for the application of a multichannel interface for the restoration of feedback in prosthetics. The high-resolution augmented interfaces might be used to explore novel scenarios for effective communication with the prosthesis user enabled by maximizing information transmission.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes a validation method of the fabrication technology of a screen‐printed electronic skin based on polyvinylidene fluoride‐trifluoroethylene P(VDF‐TrFE) piezoelectric polymer sensors. This required researchers to insure, through non‐direct sensor characterization, that printed sensors were working as expected. For that, we adapted an existing model to non-destructively extract sensor behavior in pure compression (i.e., the d33 piezocoefficient) by indentation tests over the skin surface. Different skin patches, designed to sensorize a glove and a prosthetic hand (11 skin patches, 104 sensors), have been tested. Reproducibility of the sensor response and its dependence upon sensor position on the fabrication substrate were examined, highlighting the drawbacks of employing large A3‐sized substrates. The average value of d33 for all sensors was measured at incremental preloads (1–3 N). A systematic decrease has been checked for patches located at positions not affected by substrate shrinkage. In turn, sensor reproducibility and d33 adherence to literature values validated the e‐skin fabrication technology. To extend the predictable behavior to all skin patches and thus increase the number of working sensors, the size of the fabrication substrate is to be decreased in future skin fabrication. The tests also demonstrated the efficiency of the proposed method to characterize embedded sensors which are no more accessible for direct validation.",

      "abstract": "The electronic skin system is usually made of distributed tactile sensors integrated with an embedded electronic system for tactile data decoding. Meaningful information e.g. texture classification and pattern recognition can be decoded from tactile data by employing machine learning methods. Near sensors computation using embedded machine learning algorithms may enable the electronic skin system to be used in various application domains such as wearable Internet of Things devices, prosthetics, and robotics. However, embedding machine-learning algorithms is constrained by the high computational complexity of Machine Learning methods. This poses relevant challenges on 1) real-time operation and 2) very low (e.g. pJ/op) power/energy consumption due to the limited energy budget available on wearable/portable systems. In this perspective, the paper presents our recent achievements in the implementation of embedded machine learning methods for near sensors tactile data processing. The paper provides an overview about the implementation on dedicated hardware platforms. Finally, efficient techniques for embedded machine learning highlighting the challenges and perspectives are discussed with major emphasis on energy-efficient intelligent electronic skin systems.",

In this regards, we used a 3D virtual hand simulator to communicate the tactile information resulting from hand manipulation.

      "abstract": "Tactile sensory feedback systems could enable the prosthetic system to convey touch information to the amputee. Employing sensor arrays with a high number of sensors gives high-resolution tactile information but imposes challenges on the embedded electronics in processing and transmitting a large number of tactile data to the prosthetic user. This work proposes the design of a FPGA-based approach for tactile sensory feedback systems that employs an optical fiber data communication link for prosthetic applications. The system consists of an interface electronics to manage the data acquisition from the tactile sensor array, a digital coding unit, an optical fiber-based communication link, a digital decoding unit and a further interface electronics to communicate with external apparatus. The data acquisition process followed by a UWB-based optical modulation allows for the transmission of pulsed coded tactile data through the optical fiber to a final user by means of, for example, an electrotactile stimulator combined with flexible electrodes. The transmitter and receiver systems have been implemented on two different FPGA boards with the optical communication channel connecting the two boards. The designed system functionality was demonstrated by employing an experimental setup where sequence of sensor data, emulating an array of 32 sensors sampled at 2kHz, were employed to verify the correctness of the data transmission at 100Mbps data rate through the optical fiber. Experimental results validated the functionality of the proposed design and demonstrated that the optical communication link highly improves the robustness to electromagnetic disturbances, the transmission data rate as well as the power consumption.",

      "abstract": "Tactile sensors are widely employed to enable the sense of touch for applications such as robotics and prosthetics. In addition to the selection of an appropriate sensing material, the performance of the tactile sensing system is conditioned by its interface electronic system. On the other hand, due to the need to embed the tactile sensing system into a prosthetic device, strict requirements such as small size and low power consumption are imposed on the system design. This paper presents the experimental assessment and characterization of an interface electronic system for piezoelectric tactile sensors for prosthetic applications. The interface electronic is proposed as part of a wearable system intended to be integrated into an upper limb prosthetic device. The system is based on a low power arm-microcontroller and a DDC232 device. Electrical and electromechanical setups have been implemented to assess the response of the interface electronic with PVDF-based piezoelectric sensors. The results of electrical and electromechanical tests validate the correct functionality of the proposed system.",

The data acquired from the tactile sensors are coded by using a UWB-based optical modulation and transmitted by an optical fiber to the user through electrotactile stimulations. The use of the optical communication link highly improves the system robustness to electromagnetic disturbances, the transmission data rate as well as the power consumption.",

Using a transfer learning approach formalized through a CNN, we address the challenging task of the recognition of the object that was touched by the E-Skin.

This paper presents the design and implementation of an energy efficient smart system for tactile sensing based on a RISC-V parallel ultra-low power platform (PULP). The PULP processor, called Mr. Wolf, performs the on-board classification of different touch modalities. This demonstrates the promising use of on-board classification for emerging robot and prosthetic applications. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the platform on improving the energy efficiency of the online classification. In our experiments, Mr. Wolf runs 3.6 times faster than an ARM Cortex M4F (STM32F40), consuming only 28 mW. The proposed platform achieves 15× better energy efficiency, than the classification done on the STM32F40, consuming only 81mJ per classification.",

The proposed interface is based on resistance-to-time conversion. Such conversion represents a suitable signal conditioning to interface resistive sensors varying over a wide range. The output waveform of time-based circuits can be easily interfaced when connected to a counter or a microcontroller. The readout circuit designed in AMS 0.35 μm-dual 1.65 V CMOS technology shows that the wide resistance range varying from 10 kΩ to 10GΩ is converted into time domain with a relative linearity error lower than 0.9% and achieves a dynamic range of 161 dB over 6-decades at transistor level simulation. Such high dynamic range is required for outdoor air quality monitoring and at the same time to overcome the sensor drift.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we present a device for low-latency compressive pressure sensing based on the use of a piezoelectric material coupled to mixed-mode neuromorphic CMOS circuits. The sensing element is based on the POSFET (Piezoelectric Oxide-Semiconductor-Field-Effect-Transistor) device, whereby the polarization induced by pressure in the piezoelectric material biases a CMOS transistor. The resulting output current feeds a subthreshold Leaky Integrate and Fire neuron that encodes the sensed force into trains of digital pulses. The proposed device produces output pulses whose instantaneous frequency is proportional to the applied force, only when the input force changes, drastically compressing the signal. The output features also low latency with respect to the change, as it is not limited by the sampling frequency of clocked digital to analog converters. We present the simulation as well as the full electrical and electromechanical characterization of the latest device prototype produced in AMS 180-nm process – coupled with the piezoelectric material – highlighting improvements over older versions, comprising smaller silicon estate, higher sensitivity, lower power consumption and bandwidth.",

To this aim, the prosthesis can be supplied with sensory arrays to measure the tactile interaction with the environment. In addition, a reliable feedback system is required to code and transmit the measured somatosensory information to the residual limb. This paper presents a multichannel electrotactile stimulation interface. Two coding schemes (mixed and uniform coding) were tested to assess the ability of the subject to localize the stimulation (identify the active pad). The outcome measures were position recognition and frequency discrimination. Our preliminary results show high accuracies in discriminating different frequency levels, i.e., 80% for low-level frequencies and 87% for high-level frequencies. In addition, the mixed coding has substantially improved the spatial localization. These are important insights regarding the development of multichannel sensing and stimulation systems for feedback in prosthetics.",

      "abstract": "Approximate computing has emerged as a promising approach to energy-efficient design of digital systems in many domains such as digital signal processing, robotics, and machine learning. Numerous studies report that employing different data formats in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), the dominant Machine Learning approach, could allow substantial improvements in power efficiency considering an acceptable quality for results. In this work, the application of Tunable Floating-Point (TFP) precision to DNN is presented. In TFP different precisions for different operations can be set by selecting a specific number of bits for significand and exponent in the floating-point representation. Flexibility in tuning the precision of given layers of the neural network may result in a more power efficient computation.",

This paper presents an assessment of approximate computing methods at algorithmic, architecture, and circuit levels and draws perspectives for further developments and applications. The main goal is to investigate how approximate computing may reduce the complexity and enable the feasibility of embedded Machine Learning (ML) systems. Though ML is a powerful paradigm for applications in the perceptual domain (i.e. vision, touch, hearing, etc.), their computational complexity is very high and consequently real time operation and ultra-low power are still very challenging objectives.

      "abstract": "Developing portable autonomous systems is highly requested for numerous application domains such as Internet of Things (IoT), wearable devices, and biomedical applications. Portable systems usually contain autonomous and networked sensors; each sensor hosts multiple input channels (e.g. tactile) closely coupled to embedded computing unit and power supply. The embedded computing unit should locally extract meaningful information by employing sophisticated methods. This imposes challenges on real time operation and adds a burden regarding power consumption. Approximate or inexact computing represents a promising solution for energy efficient data processing; it tunes the accuracy of computation on the specific application requirements in order to reduce power consumption. In this paper, inexact arithmetic circuits have been employed to improve the energy efficiency for sensors digital data processing. The proposed inexact circuits achieve up to 80% power saving when compared to the exact one, and similar solutions presented in literature with a maximum loss of 1.39 dB in output SNR when applied to FIR filters.",

      "abstract": "Computation accuracy can be adequately tuned on the specific application requirements in order to reduce power consumption. To give some examples, image processing and audio/speech recognition e.g., multimedia applications may provide more accurate outputs than human capabilities can appreciate. In this case, producing inexact numerical outputs can be acceptable and approximate computing circuits could be employed to reduce power consumption by decreasing the hardware complexity. This paper proposes approximate multipliers based on exact and inexact adder circuits and their FPGA implementation: the proposed multipliers can be applied for both signed and unsigned operations. Two scenarios were considered and analyzed in this paper. First, the performance of the proposed multiplier based on inexact adder is evaluated by comparing the power consumption, the accuracy of computation, and the time delay with those of an approximate multiplier based on exact adder. Second, the design parameters of the proposed multipliers are compared with those of the Baugh-Wooley multiplier. On the other hand, we analyzed and compared the performance of the unsigned approximate multipliers with respect to the signed approximate ones. Results prove that the proposed approximate multipliers achieve a reduction in power consumption of 56.3% with respect to the Baugh-Wooley multiplier at cost of less than 5% of accuracy loss.",

      "abstract": "Electronic skin (e-skin) is playing a key role in medicine, prosthetic and robot applications. E-skin tries to sense the world like the human skin does, exploiting arrays of sensors that produce a huge amount of data to be processed. Processing tactile data close to the e-skin imposes big challenges in terms of energy efficiency and real-time functionality. Energy efficient is particularly important for wearable and prosthetic applications where e-skin is mainly used as a wearable device supplied by battery. The major challenges it to find a sweet spot between power consumption and performance as tactile data decoding implementation requires high amount of computational power. This paper presents the hardware-software implementation of a complete low power embedded system that matches the computational requirements and the energy efficiency exploiting an ultralow power parallel processor. Tactile data decoding is directly performed on the embedded system, with a support vector machine (SVM) based tensor kernel algorithm, which classifies the input touch modalities. The paper presents the implementation of the algorithm in details and the power performance of the whole system based on experimental evaluation. Experimental results show that the energy efficiency is 9 times more than system based on a low power ARM-Cortex M4. Finally, the simulation on the energy consumption demonstrated that the developed system is able to last for 19.8 h in continuous mode with a single 2 Ah Lithium Polymer battery.",

      "abstract": "Modern prostheses aim at restoring the functional and aesthetic characteristics of the lost limb. To foster prosthesis embodiment and functionality, it is necessary to re-establish both volitional control and sensory feedback. Contemporary feedback interfaces presented in research use few sensors and stimulation units to feedback at most two discrete feedback variables (e.g., grasping force and aperture), whereas the human sense of touch relies on a distributed network of mechanoreceptors providing high-fidelity spatial information. To provide this type of feedback in prosthetics, it is necessary to sense tactile information from artificial skin placed on the prosthesis and transmit tactile feedback above the amputation in order to map the interaction between the prosthesis and the environment. This paper will provide a perspective on the use of distributed sensing and electrical stimulation systems for the restoration of the sense of touch in prosthetics.",

      "abstract": "In most robotic and biomedical applications, the interest for real-time embedded systems with tactile ability has been growing. For example in prosthetics, a dedicated portable system is needed for developing wearable devices. The main challenges for such systems are low latency, low power consumption and reduced hardware complexity. In order to improve hardware efficiency and reduce power consumption, approximate computing techniques have been assessed. This strategy is suitable for error-tolerant applications involving a large amount of data to be processed, which perfectly fits tactile data processing. This paper presents the first case study of applying Inexact Speculative Adders (ISA) to the FPGA implementation of a Coordinate Rotation Digital Computer (CORDIC) module within the Machine Learning algorithm of a tactile data processing system. The design has been synthesized and implemented on a Xilinx ZYNQ-7000 ZC702 device. Preliminary results have shown dynamic power reduction up to 40% and delay latency reduction up to 21% compared to a conventional CORDIC module, at the cost of a negligible average relative error of 0.049% for sine and 0.003% for cosine computations.",

      "abstract": "The implementation of tactile data decoding on low power embedded system is crucial for the development of e-skin systems that are body worn and supplied by batteries. These embedded electronic systems have to comply with severe constraints imposed by the application, especially real-time functionality battery lifetime. One of the main challenges it to find a sweet spot between power consumption and performance as tactile data decoding implementation requires high amount of computational power. In this paper, we present the assessment of the system energy efficiency of tactile data decoding using an ultra-low power parallel platform. The work performs tactile data decoding using a support vector machine (SVM) based tensor kernel algorithm for input touch modalities classification. To improve the energy efficiency the system use a parallel ultra-low power (PULP) processor that satisfies the computational demands of the e-skin system by decoding the data streams generated by an array of tactile sensors. PULP allows to meet the computational requirements of the target application, without exceeding the power envelope of a 150 mW needed to have a long-term wearable device. We present the whole platform supported by experimental results that show the benefits in terms of low power and computational performance. The proposed algorithm runs more than 9x faster than an ARM Cortex M4 at 168MHz with the same consumption.",

      "abstract": "MOX gas sensors show a wide input resistance variation due to different employed materials, sensor ageing, and temperature variations, when encountering target gases. From the electronics point of view, a wide dynamic range readout interface is needed. The role of the interface is to accommodate the signal received by the sensor in order to be converted into digital or quasi-digital signal. This operation results to be very expensive in terms of calibration when exploiting a multi-scale approach (not satisfactory in terms of accuracy without calibration) or exploiting range compression either logarithmic or quadratic leading to unavoidable voltage drop. In this perspective, the paper presents the design of calibration-less, wide range readout electronic interface circuit with a quasi-digital output. The proposed resistance to time (R-to-T) architecture converts the wide resistance range (10k to 10G) into time with a relative linearity error lower than 1% and achieves a dynamic range of 153dB over 6-decades at transistor level simulations.",

      "abstract": "Efficient low power design is one of the most important metrics facing the embedded electronic systems. Many low power design techniques and technologies are developed and used in various domains aiming to meet the application demands. In this paper we present an efficient approach combining two different techniques at architecture and circuit levels to reduce the power consumption of CORDIC circuits. At architecture level we propose a scalable precision architecture which turns-off a part of the circuit during real time functionality to reduce the circuit dynamic power. Then, we exploit the use of inexact adders at the place of the normal ones in the reconfigurable CORDIC circuit. The proposed approach provides a good improvement over the other similar systems: it decreases up to 6× the slice-delay product when performance is compared; moreover, the proposed reconfigurable approximate CORDIC reduces 40% the consumption of power when operating in normal mode, and achieves a reduction up to 73% over the other systems when operating in Save-mode 1.",

      "abstract": "Myoelectric prostheses are successfully controlled using muscle electrical activity, thereby restoring lost motor functions. However, the somatosensory feedback from the prosthesis to the user is still missing. The sensory substitution methods described in the literature comprise mostly simple position and force sensors combined with discrete stimulation units. The present study describes a novel system for sophisticated electrotactile feedback integrating advanced distributed sensing (electronic skin) and stimulation (matrix electrodes). The system was tested in eight healthy subjects who were asked to recognize the shape, trajectory, and direction of a set of dynamic movement patterns (single lines, geometrical objects, letters) presented on the electronic skin. The experiments demonstrated that the system successfully translated the mechanical interaction into the moving electrotactile profiles, which the subjects could recognize with a good performance (shape recognition: 86±8 lines, 73±13% geometries, 72±12% letters). In particular, the subjects could identify the movement direction with a high confidence. These results are in accordance with previous studies investigating the recognition of moving stimuli in human subjects. This is an important development towards closed-loop prostheses providing comprehensive and sophisticated tactile feedback to the user, facilitating the control and the embodiment of the artificial device into the user body scheme.",

      "abstract": "Enabling touch-sensing capability would help appliances understand interaction behaviors with their surroundings. Many recent studies are focusing on the development of electronic skin because of its necessity in various application domains, namely autonomous artificial intelligence (e.g., robots), biomedical instrumentation, and replacement prosthetic devices. An essential task of the electronic skin system is to locally process the tactile data and send structured information either to mimic human skin or to respond to the application demands. The electronic skin must be fabricated together with an embedded electronic system which has the role of acquiring the tactile data, processing, and extracting structured information. On the other hand, processing tactile data requires efficient methods to extract meaningful information from raw sensor data. Machine learning represents an effective method for data analysis in many domains: it has recently demonstrated its effectiveness in processing tactile sensor data. In this framework, this paper presents the implementation of digital signal processing based on FPGAs for tactile data processing. It provides the implementation of a tensorial kernel function for a machine learning approach. Implementation results are assessed by highlighting the FPGA resource utilization and power consumption. Results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed implementation when real-time classification of input touch modalities are targeted.",

Over an input resistance range of more than 5-decades (500ω to 100Mω), a precision, less than 1%, required by novel gas sensing system in portable applications, is preserved. As a result, the proposed circuit obtains high accuracy under simulation. The outputs of the proposed Resistance to Current (R-to-I) conversion circuit achieve a percentage error below 0.25% under environment corners. The reliability of the proposed circuit is also investigated under the effect of process variations. In order to assess the correctness of the proposed architecture, the circuit was compared to similar solutions presented in literature.

      "abstract": "Automotive communication systems are complex distributed systems. The design of the electrical physical layer (EPL) is a challenging task. Many parameters affect the signal integrity on the analog bus and the combination of parameter variations can lead to effects (e.g., signal reflections) which degrade the signal and compromise the system reliability. Model-based simulations have been widely proposed as the solution for the design, testing and verification of FlexRay networks. This paper proposes a model-based framework for the design and evaluation of FlexRay communication systems. The framework includes the development of FlexRay system components, the design of different network topologies and the simulation and analysis of EPL. The proposed framework has been developed and possible applications have been figured out. Furthermore, the validation of the proposed approach has been addressed. The validation focuses on the accuracy of the simulations in representing the analog signal on the bus, as well as the accuracy in representing the network timing characteristics. The validation exhaustively explores the system design space, achieving a rigorous analysis of the approach reliability: simulations of 40 different network topologies and 1,264 frames have been evaluated, by comparing simulation results with hardware measurements. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework accurately represents the hardware behavior, and it can be an useful toll during the design and early verification of FlexRay communication networks. Due to the lack of a formal validation approach for the validation of the electrical physical layer, the validation is valuable for the FlexRay community.",

Thus, to design the integrated read out solution, the accuracy in the converted data should be preserved. In this paper, a wide range resistance to current conversion circuit for gas sensing applications is designed. High linear current mirror in push pull configuration is implemented as well. Simulation results show that the circuit achieves a percentage error in the converted current between 0.12% and 0.25% over 7 decades for the sensor's resistance ranging from 100Ω to 1GΩ. The current mirror achieves an absolute percentage gain factor error of 0.2% and 0.46% for PMOS and NMOS current mirrors respectively.",

      "abstract": "Endowing appliances with the capability of sensing and processing touch enables tactile interaction between electronic devices and the environment. E-skin organized as a set of multiple sensing components and integrated with a dedicated embedded electronic system can implement the communication link between e-skin and surroundings. Basing the analysis on a relevant application example (i.e. human prosthetics), the present study describes a system including an electronic skin and a stimulation unit. The overall system was validated and tested in eight healthy subjects, who were asked to recognize the shape, position and direction of a set of dynamic mechanical stimuli presented on the electronic skin. The results demonstrated that tactile information was successfully translated from a mechanical interaction applied on the e-skin into electrotactile patterns, which the subjects could recognize with a good performance. As the obtained results are promising, in this paper the challenging requirements for the integration of e-skin into prosthetic devices were assessed, mainly focusing on computational complexity of the embedded data processing unit.",

      "abstract": "Due to its very peculiar features, the development of e-skin can be effectively tackled using a holistic approach. Starting from the definition of system specifications, the mechanical arrangement of the skin itself needs to be designed and fabricated together with the electronic embedded system, to move towards aspects such as tactile data processing algorithms and the communication channel interface. In this paper we present the design, the implementation and the results on the way of the development of an electronic skin (e-skin) system based on arrays of piezopolymer transducers. Focus of the paper is on both the development of innovative approaches for tactile information processing and electronic system embedding into the e-skin structure. In particular, Machine Learning technologies can provide a powerful tool to tackle the pattern-recognition problems involved in the tactile sensing framework and the ability of processing data represented as N-th order tensor is the key aspect of the presented research, which can be seen as an application of an existing method (Signoretto et al., 2011). The experimental session compares two different implementations of the ML-based framework, which differ in the learning paradigm adopted, namely SVM and ELM (K-ELM). The effectiveness of the adopted pattern-recognition technologies in the classification of touch modalities has been confirmed by addressing two different binary classification problems in an experiment involving 70 participants. The computational requirements for the hardware implementation of the proposed algorithm together with an overview of what exists in the existing literature are finally discussed.",

      "abstract": "Variations have emerged as one of the most significant challenges facing the design of integrated circuits in nanoscale technologies. Next generation of resilient embedded electronic systems require reliability-aware design methods from circuit to algorithmic levels without significantly reducing system performance or imposing large area/high power consumption overheads. In this paper, we provide an overview about resiliency in nanometer CMOS systems. An analysis about the sources of variability and their effects on system design is presented and the emerging solutions that counteract the key reliability issues are assessed. Furthermore, strategies and research directions for achieving resiliency are proposed. The emerging solutions will pave the way towards resilient nanometer CMOS systems for relevant application domains such as Internet of Things, Humanoid Robotics and Neuroengineering.",

Rectangular electrode arrays are placed on each patient's forearm and experiments are conducted on five different subjects to determine how well the orientation, position and direction of single lines are recognized. Overall, subjects discriminate the different touch modalities with acceptable success rates. In particular, the direction is identified at best and longitudinal lines on the patient's skin are recognized with the highest success rates.

      "abstract": "This paper addresses the implementation of indoor real-time localisation system (RLTS) using wireless sensor networks. A RLTS consists of anchor nodes (i.e. nodes with fixed and known locations), beacon nodes and a location engine: the beacon node to be localised sends a packet which is captured from some anchor nodes, the anchor nodes forward the information extracted from the packet to the location engine for the estimation of the position of the transmitting beacon node. The authors present an algorithm that achieves beacon node localisation accuracy of a few metres in indoor environments. The algorithm is based on two steps: in the first step, the algorithm computes the ranging between anchor nodes and beacon node, in the second one, the algorithm estimates the beacon node localisation. The received signal strength indicator (RSSI) is used for the ranging estimation. The proposed approach avoids dedicated and expensive devices, which are used for the synchronisation between beacon and anchor nodes, to compute the time-of-flight of the signal. The authors introduce a confidence parameter for improving accuracy (based on the standard deviation of the RSSI), and an anchor nodes selection strategy for tackling the problem of nonline-of-sight communication between nodes.",

      "abstract": "The main task of robotic skin is recognition of tactile stimuli acting on the surface of a soft elastic layer through the outputs of embedded sensor arrays. The focus of this work is the development of an algorithm for estimating the spatial distribution of contact forces as well as their intensities and directions starting from sensor data. This requires the solution of an inverse problem where only incomplete information (e.g. normal stress on the sensors) is usually available. The proposed method discretizes external forces at the nodes of a grid. The more practical solution is fixing the node number equal to the number of sensors. In this case, the inverse problem of retrieving the force distribution from sensor data is trivially solved if normal forces are applied. For multi-component force distributions, on the other hand, the problem is in principle ill-posed. A solution is achieved through an optimization procedure accounting for the physical features of the problem by the use of the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse matrix and of a vector depending on two continuous and adjustable scalar parameters. The algorithm has been tested on simulated single-contact problems (both Hertzian and non-Hertzian normal force distributions) with encouraging results for both accuracy and robustness of the solution.",

The proposed pattern-recognition system showed good accuracy in performing touch classification in a three-class classification experiment, opening interesting scenarios for the application of tensor-based models to support human-robot interactions.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach for realizing tactile sensors by integrating a piezoelectric polymer with a low voltage Organic Thin-Film Transistor (OTFT) on flexible plastic substrates. The transducing element consists of PVDF piezoelectric film. The proposed device architecture is similar to the extended gate scheme, whereby the transducing material is connected to OTFT via extended gate. In this scheme, the OTFTs and the transducer material may be or same substrate, as in this case, or they may be on different substrates. The piezoelectric effect induced by an external mechanical stimulus modulates the output current of the OTFT. This scheme represents a simple and innovative solution for artificial sense of touch and is particularly suitable for the low-cost fabrication of so-called \"electronic skin\". The electromechanical characterization shows that the sensing devices can detect forces stimuli within the range 0.5-8N.",

In this preliminary study, the skin response to the applied mechanical stimuli is conveyed to the human subject using electrotactile stimulation. Experimental tests on two healthy subjects show that a short training through reinforced learning increased considerably the success rate in the identification of the impact location. This preliminary study demonstrates the feasibility of communicating the tactile information from the electronic skin to the human subject using multichannel electrocutaneous stimulation.

      "abstract": "Future robots are expected to work closely and interact safely with real-world objects and humans alike. Sense of touch is important in this context, as it helps estimate properties such as shape, texture, hardness, material type and many more; provides action related information, such as slip detection; and helps carrying out actions such as rolling an object between fingers without dropping it. This book presents an in-depth description of the solutions available for gathering tactile data, obtaining aforementioned tactile information from the data and effectively using the same in various robotic tasks. The efforts during last four decades or so have yielded a wide spectrum of tactile sensing technologies and engineered solutions for both intrinsic and extrinsic touch sensors. Nowadays, new materials and structures are being explored for obtaining robotic skin with physical features like bendable, conformable, and stretchable. Such features are important for covering various body parts of robots or 3D surfaces. Nonetheless, there exist many more hardware, software and application related issues that must be considered to make tactile sensing an effective component of future robotic platforms. This book presents an in-depth analysis of various system related issues and presents the trade-offs one may face while developing an effective tactile sensing system. For this purpose, human touch sensing has also been explored. The design hints coming out of the investigations into human sense of touch can be useful in improving the effectiveness of tactile sensory modality in robotics and other machines. Better integration of tactile sensors on a robot's body is prerequisite for the effective utilization of tactile data. The concept of semiconductor devices based sensors is an interesting one, as it allows compact and fast tactile sensing systems with capabilities such as human-like spatio-temporal resolution. This book presents a comprehensive description of semiconductor devices based tactile sensing. In particular, novel Piezo Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor (POSFET) based approach for high resolution tactile sensing has been discussed in detail. Finally, the extension of semiconductors devices based sensors concept to large and flexile areas has been discussed for obtaining robotic or electronic skin. With its multidisciplinary scope, this book is suitable for graduate students and researchers coming from diverse areas such robotics (bio-robots, humanoids, rehabilitation etc.), applied materials, humans touch sensing, electronics, microsystems, and instrumentation. To better explain the concepts the text is supported by large number of figures.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents the advanced version of novel piezoelectric oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (POSFET) devices-based tactile sensing chip. The new version of the tactile sensing chip presented here comprises of a 4 \\(\\times \\) 4 array of POSFET touch sensing devices and integrated interface electronics (i.e. multiplexers, high compliance current sinks, and voltage output buffers). The chip also includes four temperature diodes for the measurement of contact temperature. Various components on the chip have been characterized systematically and the overall operation of the tactile sensing system has been evaluated. With new design, the POSFET devices have improved performance [i.e. linear response in the dynamic contact forces range of 0.01-3 N and sensitivity (without amplification) of 102.4 mV/N], which is more than twice the performance of their previous implementations. The integrated interface electronics result in reduced interconnections which otherwise would be needed to connect the POSFET array with off-chip interface electronic circuitry. This paper paves the way for CMOS implementation of full on-chip tactile sensing systems based on POSFETs. © 2001-2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Artificial skin systems support human-robot interactions through touch. The interpretation of touch modalities indeed represents a crucial component for the future development of robots that can properly interact with humans. Independently of the specific employed transducer, one of the key issues is how to process the massively complex and high-dimensional tactile data. In this paper, machine learning technologies (namely, support vector machines and extreme learning machines) support a pattern-recognition framework that can fully exploit the tensor morphology of the tactile signal. Furthermore, a practical strategy is provided to address the intricacies of the training procedure. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2001-2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "A wide variety of tactile (touch) sensors exist today for robotics and related applications. They make use of various transduction methods, smart materials and engineered structures, complex electronics, and sophisticated data processing. While highly useful in themselves, effective utilization of tactile sensors in robotics applications has been slow to come and largely remains elusive today. This paper surveys the state of the art and the research issues in this area, with the emphasis on effective utilization of tactile sensors in robotic systems. One specific with the use of tactile sensing in robotics is that the sensors have to be spread along the robot body, the way the human skin is-thus dictating varied 3-D spatio-temporal requirements, decentralized and distributed control, and handling of multiple simultaneous tactile contacts. Satisfying these requirements pose challenges to making tactile sensor modality a reality. Overcoming these challenges requires dealing with issues such as sensors placement, electronic/mechanical hardware, methods to access and acquire signals, automatic calibration techniques, and algorithms to process and interpret sensing data in real time. We survey this field from a system perspective, recognizing the fact that the system performance tends to depend on how its various components are put together. It is hoped that the survey will be of use to practitioners designing tactile sensing hardware (whole-body or large-patch sensor coverage), and to researchers working on cognitive robotics involving tactile sensing. © 2013 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "This paper deals with tactile sensing systems based on a piezoelectric polymer poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) film on the gate area of a MOS (Metal Oxide Semiconductor) transistor: Piezoelectric Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor, POSFET. More specifically, we present the design and analysis of the interface electronic circuit between the touch sensor transducer and the signal conditioning circuit stage. The circuit configuration is based on a NMOS transistor in common-drain and floating gate bias configuration. Such configuration enhances and complements the transducer's response. However, the circuit interface design suffers of the very difficult analytical tractability. For this reason, a graphical methodology, intended to give a criterion for achieving the selection of the most appropriate bias resistance value has been developed. The methodology utilizes the Advanced Compact MOSFET (ACM) model and the g<inf>m</inf> characteristic as function of the NMOS transistor drain current I<inf>D</inf>. A design space map shows confidence regions where the specifications such as touch sensing device gain, current consumption and source resistance value are met. The design methodology enables to push the performance of the POSFET by selecting the most appropriate bias resistance value and it reduces time-consuming iterations which are normally required. As a proof of concept of the proposed methodology, measurements as well as a design example are presented. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes and describes a charge amplifier-based interface electronics design methodology approach for piezoelectric polymer tactile sensors to be used for humanoid robot applications. The tactile sensor-consisting of a PVDF single sensor element-is illustrated, the electromechanical thickness mode behavior is modeled and a fabricated prototype is presented. The model allows associating the PVDF charge response to the effective load applied on the outer surface of the sensor. The model is also used as a key in the proposed design methodology to estimate the charge to be detected by the charge amplifier. A case study based on the design methodology approach is reported. The system (PVDF single taxel + interface electronics) is analyzed firstly, considering it as ideal and then when the nonidealities come into play. A charge amplifier-based interface electronics prototype is also presented. The implementation is used to validate the followed approach and then defining the design specs towards the dedicated IC design. Some experimental results are also reported. © 2013 World Scientific Publishing Company.",

So far, a principled investigation of these issues has been limited by the lack of tactile sensing technology enabling large scale experimental activities. As a matter of fact, skin based technology and embedded tactile sensors have been mostly demonstrated only at the stage of prototypes. The new capabilities are expected to improve the ability of robots to effectively and safely operate in unconstrained environments, as well as to communicate and cooperate with each other and with humans.",

      "abstract": "We show by experimentation that the effectiveness of acoustic event detectors is strongly influenced by the work environment, sensor signal filtering and event detection algorithm implementations. In particular, our work considers networks of wireless embedded hardware and two application scenarios. The first application is aimed to detect human activities that are developed in indoor environments, home or office buildings, whereas the second one detects moving motor vehicles within urban environments (outdoors) sensing their motor sounds. In each case, the event detector implementations are made up of two components, one filtering and one detection algorithm, designed considering the signals features observed in the environments of interest. In our experimentation we analyze the performances of event detectors integrated by two different implementations of the event detection modules. Particularly, in the indoors event detection scenario the filtering module issues an adaptive low-pass filter, whereas the event detector module implementation includes experimental results running a signal energy change rate estimator and a signal energy threshold based detector. On the other hand, in the outdoors case the detector filter is a 46 taps band-pass filter and like in the indoors case, the event detector module considers the use of the signal energy change rate estimator and the signal energy threshold based detector. The realization of the event detectors is guided by the results of a calibration procedure, for this purpose we gather actual acoustic signals of the environment under consideration. In the case of the indoors scenario three basic human activities have been collected: closing a door, dropping a plastic bottle, and clapping. In the outdoors case, we register two types of car sounds: a single car passing and a car stopped. To quantify the event detection effectiveness we employ more general environmental acoustic signals such as: people talking for the indoors case and a flow of cars moving down street for the outdoors case. The indoors event detection results showed that the best events rate detection was achieved by the detector made up of the low-pass filter and the energy change rate estimator arriving up to 90% of the people talking activity detection. In the outdoors case, we find that unlike the indoors case, the event detector featuring the band-pass filter and the energy threshold detector has the best performance, accomplishing up to 85% of the vehicle signals detection.",

The application of POSFET has been reported in papers for tactile sensing. High value resistance has been achieved through well to drain connected PMOS device working in weak inversion. The mathematical formulations of the devices were based on the concept of EKV equations. Mathematical derivation and analysis was made to calculate the value of resistance, and then bias voltage and bias current for the proposed circuit. Simulation results show that the proposed circuit arrangement is able to realize the high value resistance. © 2011 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "In the last few years the amount of electronics inside cars has increased significantly. Current vehicles have implemented highly distributed electronic systems. The high number of Electronic Control Units (ECUs) and the high amount of data which must be exchanged require high bandwidth and reliable communication systems. Flexray is the communication protocol developed to fulfill these requirements. Due to its higher data rate and consequent bit length reduction, Flexray has more restrictive specifications than its precursor. One of the main goals of the communication network designers is on ensuring sufficient signal integrity at the analog bus. Behavioral simulations can be a useful tool for forecasting design problems and for supporting architecture decision. In this context, the paper explains the main reasons for analyzing the Electrical Physical Layer (EPL), lists the advantages of using behavioral simulations and provides a detailed overview of the challenges related to network design and verification. Moreover, it illustrates the impact of different aspects by way of dedicated use cases, such as topology decision and aging effects, on the signal integrity and therefore on communication quality and system robustness. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",

      "abstract": "The two major components of a robotic tactile-sensing system are the tactile-sensing hardware at the lower level and the computational/software tools at the higher level. Focusing on the latter, this research assesses the suitability of computational-intelligence (CI) tools for tactile-data processing. In this context, this paper addresses the classification of sensed object material from the recorded raw tactile data. For this purpose, three CI paradigms, namely, the support-vector machine (SVM), regularized least square (RLS), and regularized extreme learning machine (RELM), have been employed, and their performance is compared for the said task. The comparative analysis shows that SVM provides the best tradeoff between classification accuracy and computational complexity of the classification algorithm. Experimental results indicate that the CI tools are effective in dealing with the challenging problem of material classification. © 2011 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "This paper analyses a complete self-powered vibration based energy scavenging system. For the purpose of the analysis, the energy scavenging system (comprising of a SPICE model of Piezoelectric Bender Generator (PBG), an integrated semi-active bridge rectifier and a voltage regulator circuit) has been implemented in SPICE and presented in this paper. The semi-active bridge rectifier proposed in this paper uses Vertical Double-diffused MOS (VDMOS) transistors in place of standard diodes, to be suitable to withstand the high voltage values generated by PBGs. Using SPICE the analysis of the reciprocal interaction between PBG and scavenging system (in terms of stress, strain rate, mechanical and electrical powers at various loads and regulated voltages) is investigated. The simulation results of the semi-active bridge rectifier have shown an efficiency of the rectifier of about the 90 %. The simulation results of the whole system with optimized control circuits have shown how both the load and the regulated voltage can influence the behavior of stress and strain rate and vice versa. Comparisons of simulated stress and strain rate at various loads and regulated voltage values have shown an opposite behavior of the strain rate with respect to the stress. The simulation results of various powers - mechanical and electrical - from PBG to the load have shown the amount of mechanical power converted by the PBG into electrical that can be transferred to the load and that an optimal load exist. © 2010 IEEE.",

The POSFET touch sensing devices are obtained by spin coating piezoelectric polymer P(VDF-TrFE), poly(vinylidene fluoride - trifluoroethylene), film on the gate area of MOS (Metal Oxide Semiconductor) devices and polarizing the film in situ. To detect contact events, the taxels utilize the contact forces induced change in the polarization level (and hence change in the induced channel current) of piezoelectric polymer. Both, individual taxels and the array are designed to match spatio-temporal performance of the human fingertips. The data acquisition system is implemented with off-the-shelf electronic components and its design takes into account both the application related requirements as well as the constraints posed by existing hardware on the humanoid robot 'iCub'. The biasing scheme for using POSFET devices and the problems thereof are also been discussed. © 2010 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The rising demands for safety, power-weight reduction, and comfort make the in-vehicle network of embedded electronic systems very complex. In particular system reliability is essential, especially because of the safety requirements. Test and verification of the entire in-vehicle network by means of behavioral simulations are each time more widely adopted. To this aim, behavioral models that faithfully represent the behavior of mixed-mode-embedded systems are essential for achieving reliable simulation results. This paper presents a systematic development methodology for mixed-mode behavioral models of in-vehicle-embedded systems. The methodology allows achieving accurate models, which provide reliable system simulations. The model development methodology is described and the results of the methodology applied to two case studies are presented: (1) the mixed-mode behavioral model of a generic Flexray physical layer transceiver and (2) the mixed-mode behavioral model of a CAN bus transceiver-integrated circuit. The simulation results show that behavioral simulations are much faster than transistor level simulations. Moreover, behavioral simulations are flexible, which allows quickly changing and verifying the communication network topology if compared with hardware prototypes.

      "abstract": "Internal vehicle communication networks are becoming highly distributed systems. The increase of the internal vehicle electronic system complexity requires higher performance and reliability, and the necessity of ensuring enough bus signal integrity increases the design verification effort. In this paper we present a system verification methodology of Flexray communication networks through behavioral simulations as well as the analysis of important parameters which influence the communication. The paper presents the verification of different network topologies through mixed-mode behavioral simulations and the evaluation of the most critical aspects of the physical layer. Modifications in the original topologies have been performed, and their effects have been analyzed. Additionally, we give special attention to the computational effort required for the behavioral simulations. The different topologies have been simulated with two bus line models (a lossless and a lossy), and the results are evaluated in terms of CPU usage time and accuracy. © 2010 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "In-vehicle communication networks are a complex and safety-critical system, in which system reliability is essential. Network tests and verification by means of behavioral simulations have been widely adopted by the O&Ms. Among a series of advantages, behavioral simulations allow the statistical analysis performace evaluation, which is important to assess the system reliability. Our objective is to perform the in-vehicle verification, including Monte Carlo analysis, using the developed VHDL-AMS behavioral models. With this objective, we have developed the implementation of the Monte Carlo analysis through VHDL-AMS functions. The main advantage of this approach is the feature portability since it allows statistical simulation in any VHDL-AMS simulator (even if the simulator do not support statistical analysis). This paper presents the Monte Carlo implementation and reports results of the feature applied to a Flexray in-vehicle communication network. This work is part of a research activity in the field of mixed-mode behavioral models applied to the test and verification of in-vehicle communication networks.",

      "abstract": "The implementation of safety critical applications in internal vehicles requires a reliable wireline communication system to ensure enough bus line signal integrity. The design verification of in-vehicle electronic embedded system during the early stages of the system design is required and can be effectively achieved through behavioral simulations. The main difficulty is on modelling the mixed-mode communication interface, e.g. the transceiver, because it is a mixed-mode circuit. This paper introduces the mixed-mode behavioral model of Flexray physical layer transceiver and it presents the behavioral model verification. Several simulations were performed in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, regarding signal integrity, model behavior in different bus states, wake-up pattern detection, receiver sensibility and the timing characteristics. The performance was evaluated by comparing the CPU usage time of the model (implemented in VHDL-AMS) with Spectre simulations. The VHDL-AMS model was clearly faster than Spectre and it is fully compliant with the Flexray standard specifications. ©2009 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "A novel event detector algorithm, which points out in-door acoustic human activities, for constrained wireless sensor node hardware is proposed in the present paper. In our approach, event detections are computed from the signal energy statistics change rate at two instants separated by an (L - 1) samples interval. The experimentation is run in two phases: (i) the detector characterisation and tuning seek detector configurations that enable event detections from three acoustic human activities: closing a door, dropping a plastic bottle, and clapping; (ii) event detector validation tests measure the reliability to signal events from general acoustic activities, people talking particularly. The test results, which included emulated node hardware, actual sensor node, and a one-hop WSN, demonstrate the detector implementations signaled successfully events. And for the WSN, we found that event detections decay in a nonlinear fashion as the distance d, between the acoustic signal source and the sensor, is increased. Copyright © 2009 M. A.

      "abstract": "This paper presents the development of touch sensing chips for robotic applications and the experimental results from touch sensing elements on the chip. The high resolution tactile sensing chips have overall dimension of 1.5 cm x 1.5 cm and consist of 25 touch sensing elements. The touch sensing elements on the chip are the POSFET (Piezoelectric Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor) devices, obtained by depositing piezoelectric polymer directly on to the gate area of MOS transistor. Each sensing element has an effective sensing area of 0.5 mm x 0.5 mm. The tactile sensing chips are suitable for fingertips of a robot where large numbers of sensors are needed in a small space (typically 1 cm x 1.5 cm). The tactile sensing elements on the chip have been experimentally evaluated in time and frequency domain. Typically, protective rubber films of materials like PDMS Polydimethylsiloxane) are used to improve robustness of the sensors, albeit, at the cost of reduced sensitivity. Such effects on the response of POSFET touch sensing elements are studied with PDMS films having different thicknesses. ©2009 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "This paper reports the design and the experimental results of a fully integrated, low-noise, low-power standard CMOS preamplifier circuit used to record the extracellular electrophysiological activity of in vitro biological neuronal cultures. Our goal is to use the preamplifier in a fully integrated, multi-channel, bi-directional neuro-electronic interface. Among others, two main requirements must be addressed when designing such kind of integrated recording systems: noise performance and very low frequency disturbance rejection. These two requirements need to be satisfied together with a small silicon area design, to be able to integrate a large number of recording channels (i.e. up to thousands) onto a single die. A prototype preamplifier circuit has been designed and implemented; in this paper we report the experimental results. While satisfying the above requirements, our circuit offers state-of-the-art smallest area occupation (0.13 mm<sup>2</sup>) and consumes 4.5 μW. Sub-threshold-biased lateral pnp transistors, used to implement very high resistance value integrated resistors, have been characterized to determine the resistance spread. The fabricated prototype, coupled with a commercial Micro-Electrode Array (MEA), has been successfully employed to record the extracellular electrophysiological spontaneous activity, both of muscular cardiac cells (cardiomyocytes) and of spinal cord neurons from murines. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

      "abstract": "This work presents the development of tactile sensing arrays, inspired by cutaneous sensing in humans, for the fingertips of a humanoid robot. The tactile sensing arrays have been developed in two phases. Microelectrode arrays (MEA), having 32 sensing elements - each epoxy adhered with 25μm thick piezoelectric polymer (PVDF-TrFE) film, were fabricated in the first phase. When connected to the gate of FET devices (external to the chip), each element on MEA acts like an extended gate; thereby facilitating modulation of charge in the induced channel by the charge generated in PVDF-TrFE film - as a result of applied force. Thus, each sensing element converts force into voltage. The tactile sensing arrays developed in second phase work on the same principle but are free from any extended gate. These arrays (having 25 sensing elements) use POSFET (Piezoelectric Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistors) touch sensing elements - in which, piezoelectric polymer film is directly spin coated on the gate area of the FET devices. Thus, a POSFET touch sensing element 'senses and partially processes at same site' - as is done by receptors in human skin. The spatial-temporal performance of these chips is similar to that of skin in the human fingertips. ©2009 SPIE.",

In this paper, a behavioral model of a CAN bus transceiver is proposed and experimentally verified. Moreover, we developed a methodology to efficiently manage the trade-off concerning accuracy, simulation speed, and convergence issues which are usually involved in the simulation of large CAN bus networks. To this aim, three different architectures of the transceiver behavioral model have been implemented: They can be selected by the user to address specific requirements of intended analyses. The architectures are based on a set of behavioral models of the basic mixed-signal circuit building blocks of the transceiver. The models were implemented using the VHDL-AMS language. Signal integrity, fault analysis, power consumption analysis, corner analysis, etc., can be effectively and reliably implemented.

The POSFET device represents an integral \"sensotronic\" unit comprising of transducer and the transistor-thereby sensing as well as conditioning (and processing) the touch signal at \"same site.\" © 2009 American Institute of Physics.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents the development of tactile sensing chips, for the fingertips of humanoid robots. In the first phase of development, piezoelectric polymer-MEA (microelectrode array) based test chips have been realized. Each chip comprises of 32 microelectrodes, epoxy-adhered with a thin piezoelectric polymer (PVDF-TrFE) film. The diameter of each microelectrode or 'taxel' (tactile element) is 500 11m and the center to center distance between taxels is 1 mm. The tactile sensing chips have been experimentally evaluated over a wide range (0.02 - 4N or - 2 gmf- 400 gmt) of dynamic normal forces and frequencies (2 Hz-5 KHz) by applying variable force with constant frequency in the first case and constant force with variable frequency in latter. The cross-talk, among adjacent taxels on the chips, is found to be approximately 20%. Finally, the ability of the chips to identify object material on the basis of their hardness is also demonstrated. © 2009 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are composed by battery supplied nodes. Node lifetime is defined as the time when the node works properly, before battery depletion. Distances between nodes determine the required radio output power level to ensure reliable connectivity among them, affecting then the node battery current consumption. If some node runs out, it could make unreliable network function. For this, it is important to implement a deployment which assures longer node lifetime; however, this problem is a very constrained and non-lineal one. In this paper, we propose a heuristic algorithm for searching network deployments. The algorithm predicts number of nodes, nodes distances and nodes output power level in order to give a deployment that reaches maximum battery lifetime and compliant with user specifications. © 2008 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Development of robots capable of operating in unstructured environments or intended to substitute for man in hazardous or inaccessible environments, demands the implementation of sophisticated sensory capabilities, far beyond those available today. In this regard, the development of tactile sensors is one of the key technical challenges in advanced robotics and minimal access surgery. In this work we present arrays of 'taxeis' (tactile elements) which will be placed on the distal phalange of the humanoid robot in our lab. We present two different designs and implementations. In the first one, microelectrode arrays (MEAs) of 32 elements, with lmm center to center distance, have been designed. The taxel is implemented by epoxy-adhering the sensing material (piezoelectric polymer film of PVDF-TrFE) on a microelectrode. Each taxel is intended to be used as an extended gate of an FET (external to the chip); the taxel collects the charge/voltage generated, as consequence of the applied stress, on the deposited piezoelectric polymer film (i.e. the extended gate itself). The second design and implementation integrates both the taxeis array and the FET devices, on the same silicon die. © 2007 IEEE.",

The comparison of simulated versus measured behavior is undoubtedly a good measure of the simulator's reliability. The goal of this paper is to evaluate a wireless sensor network simulator (i.e. Prowler) by comparing its behavior with the measurements obtained from experimental testbeds consisting of MICAz motes. To this aim, the simulator parameters have been tuned to match the testbeds features. Moreover, representative testbeds have been developed and appropriate metrics have been defined, in order to assess the comparison. The results show that the simulator under evaluation can effectively approximate, at MAC layer, the behavior of a wireless sensor network in terms of the numbers of sent and received packets and detected collisions. © 2007 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The recent progress in both neurobiology and microelectronics suggests the creation of new, powerful tools to investigate the basic mechanisms of brain functionality. In particular, a lot of efforts are spent by scientific community to define new frameworks devoted to the analysis of in-vitro cultured neurons. One possible approach is recording their spiking activity to monitor the coordinated cellular behavior and get insights about neural plasticity. Due to the nature of neurons action-potentials, when considering the design of an integrated microelectronics-based recording system, a number of problems arise. First, one would desire to have a high number of recording sites (i.e. several hundreds): this poses constraints on silicon area and power consumption. In this regard, our aim is to integrate-through on-chip post-processing techniques-hundreds of bio-compatible micro-sensors together with CMOS standard-process low-power (i.e. some tenths of μW per channel) conditioning electronics. Each recording channel is provided with sampling electronics to insure synchronous recording so that, for example, cross-correlation between signals coming from different sites can be performed. Extra-cellular potentials are in the range of [50 - 150] μV, so a comparison in terms of noise-efficiency was carried out among different architectures and very low-noise pre-amplification electronics (i.e. less than 6.5 μV<inf>rms</inf>) was designed. As spikes measurements are made with respect to the voltage of a reference electrode, we opted for an AC-coupled differential-input preamplifier provided with band-pass filtering capability. To achieve this, we implemented large time-constant (up to seconds) integrated components in the preamp feedback path. Thus, we got rid also of random slow-drifting DC-offsets and common mode signals. The paper will present our achievements in the design and implementation of a fully integrated bio-abio interface to record neural spiking activity. In particular, preliminary results will be reported.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, a novel current mode CMOS four-quadrant analog multiplier circuit is presented. The multiplication is implemented by four translinear loops with MOS transistors operating in weak inversion. Information carrying signals are differential balanced currents. The multiplier circuit has been implemented in a test chip in a standard 0.35 μm CMOS technology. The experimental measurements (dc bias current of 250 nA and a power supply of 2.0 V) show a bandwidth of 200 kHz and a THD figure value lower than 0.9 %. The multiplier features a wide signal dynamic range and linearity, low power consumption (the maximum power consumption is of 5.5·10<sup>-6</sup> W) and very low area (18.7 10<sup>-3</sup> mm<sup>2</sup>). The multiplier is suitable for a wide range of analog signal processing applications. Due to the low power and silicon area consumption, scalability and modularity can be also easily integrated in massive parallel systems. © 2005 IEEE.",

In particular, we addressed the implementation of artificial neural networks with on-chip learning algorithms with the goal of efficiency in terms of scalability, modularity, computational density, real time operation and power consumption. We present the analog circuit architecture of a feed-forward network with on-chip weight perturbation learning in CMOS technology. Novelty of the approach lies in the circuit implementation of the feed-forward neural primitives and on the overall analog circuit architecture. The proposed circuits feature very low power consumption and robustness with respect to noise effects. We extensively tested the analog architecture with simulations at transistor level by using the netlist extracted from the physical design. The results compare favourably with those reported in the open literature. In particular, the architecture exhibits very high power efficiency and computational density and remarkable modularity and scalability features.

Moreover, the growing market for asymmetrical digital subscriber line (ADSL) applications is a driving force for the development of high speed, high resolution, sigma-delta analog-to-digital converters (ADC’s). In the wider development of ADC systems, a pre-eminent role has been played by modeling techniques. Modeling of ADC allows the device behavior to be predicted with a few of preventive experiments. For this reason, in the last years a great deal of scientific interest has been directed to ADC modeling. In this work we present a SIMULINK model, which takes into account, for the first time, the non-linear effects due to switch charge injection in Sigma-Delta modulators. These effects are non-linearly proportional to the input voltage value. This brings about offset and harmonic distortion. Therefore adequate modeling of charge injection in terms of harmonic distortion is extremely important to predict and estimate the performance of Sigma-delta modulators.",

The author presents and discusses the motivations, the system and circuit issues, the design methodology as well as the limitations of this kind of approach. Attention is focused on supervised learning algorithms because of their reliability and popularity within the neural network research community. In particular, the Back Propagation and Weight Perturbation learning algorithms are introduced and reviewed with respect to their analog VLSI implementation.

When designing sampling switches, one has usually to trade off resolution against bandwidth and aperture time. In this perspective, we modeled the aperture time of the NMOS sampling switch for low swing voltage signals taking also into account the dependence of the threshold voltage on the body effect. Then we compared the aperture time behaviour using three submicron CMOS technologies (0.8, 0.5 and 0.25 ?m minimum channel length respectively). The results indicate that an aperture time of about 100 ps is achievable with a CMOS 0.25 μm minimum channel length technology working at low supply voltage.",

      "abstract": "Supervised learning algorithms (i.e. Back Propagation algorithms, BP) are reliable and widely adopted for real world applications. Among supervised algorithms, stochastic ones (e.g. Weight Perturbation algorithms, WP) exhibit analog VLSI hardware friendly features. Though, they have not been validated on meaningful applications. This paper presents the results of a thorough experimental validation of the parallel WP learning algorithm on the recognition of handwritten characters. We adopted a local and adaptive learning rate management to increase the efficiency. Our results demonstrate that the performance of the WP algorithm are comparable to the BP ones except that the network complexity (i.e. the number of hidden neurons) is fairly lower. The average number of iterations to reach convergence is higher than in the BP case, but this cannot be considered a heavy drawback in view of the analog parallel on-chip implementation of the learning algorithm. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2002.",

The FE purpose is to Educe the redundancy of information in handwritten character images prior feeding the classifier. The analog circuit architecture of a FE block and its circuit implementation are presented and discussed in this paper, It can be used for both segmented and non-segmented strings of characters.

      "abstract": "The architecture, the design, and the analog very large scale integration (VLSI) implementation of a feature extractor chip for optical character recognition (OCR) systems are described. The chip extracts a set of 112 feature values coded by current signals from a 32 × 24 digital pixel matrix, representing the input character. Such features are applied to a classifier (for example, a neural classifier) performing the recognition task. The measurements performed on that chip confirm its functionality. The chip can be used with a segmented and nonsegmented string of characters. A throughput of about 140 kChar/s is achieved for the segmented case, while a throughput of about 450 kChar/s is achieved for the nonsegmented case. The OCR architecture has been functionally validated. A set of numerical handwritten characters has been processed by the chip and the measured output features (after a normalization operation) have been used as input for neural network classifiers implemented by a software simulator which performs the recognition task. The resulting classification error rate (4.3%) has been successfully compared with those obtained by a high level model of this chip, and the results validate the entire architecture.",

The VLSI architecture implements a highly constrained neural network tailored for this specific application: the multi-layer perceptron with strictly local connections. The learning of the weights is performed off line by using the adaptive simulated-annealing algorithm. The neural network has been trained on real plant data recognition results of the training and classification tasks compare favorably with those obtained by expert human operators. The VLSI architecture receives as input the image (taken on-line on the plant) of a mechanical part and it will find out if at least one structural surface defect is present. The VLSI architecture was optimized, through a set of transformations on the high-level VHDL specifications of the neural network algorithm, to reach real-time operating conditions. Following the proposed approach and the designed architecture, we designed and successfully tested a custom VLSI chip for the real-time implementation of the recognition task. © 1996 Academic Press Limited.",

We exhaustively tested the proposed architecture in the classification of surface defects in flat rolled strips on real plant data, obtaining a higher classification accuracy with respect to the state-of-the-art technologies.

      "abstract": "An ASIC analog chip which implements the basic computational primitives of a neural model with on-chip learning has been designed and fabricated using a 1.5 μm CMOS technology. The chip contains about 3K transistors arranged into a matrix of 8×4 synapses fully connected to 4 neurons. Using the chip as basic module, it is possible to obtain more complex networks. The adaptive architecture hosted by the analog continuous-time CMOS VLSI circuits has been devised to support high-level neural computational models (e.g. Back Propagation). Formal variables of the algorithm are translated into electrical ones. Neural circuits feature a full analog and adaptive behaviour, and directly map into hardware the basic neural computational primitives. Analog adaptive neural computation does not require high computational accuracy. Its implementation through full custom circuits is attractive, as it is efficient and compact.",

      "abstract": "An architectural configuration for the back-propagation (BP) algorithm is illustrated. The circuit solution for the basic blocks is presented, and the effect of weight discretization on the BP algorithm is analyzed. It is demonstrated, through simulations, how the BP algorithm can be operated successfully with discretized weights. In particular, better performances can be achieved with an exponential discretization, i.e., the strength of weights varies exponentially with the controlling variable (voltage). The discretized voltage values differ by a quantity high enough that the neural network can be backed up with a refresh technique in combination with a multilevel dynamic memory that entails a particularly low wiring cost. A quasi-analog adaptive architecture is devised, properly matching the BP algorithm, and its CMOS circuit implementation is detailed. The mechanism controlling weight changes is simple enough to be reproduced locally at each synapsis site, thus meeting one of the requirements for an efficient storage technology for analog VLSI.",
