      "abstract": "This paper proposes a method to perform Visual-Based Localization within an explainable self-awareness framework, by combining deep learning with traditional signal processing methods. Localization, along with anomaly detection, is an important challenge in video surveillance and fault detection. Let us consider, for example, the case of a vehicle patrolling a train station: it must continuously know its location to effectively monitor the surroundings and respond to potential threats. In the proposed method, a Dynamic Bayesian Network model is learned. A vocabulary of clusters is obtained using the odometry and video data, and is employed to guide the training of the video model. As the video model, a combination of a Variational Autoencoder and a Kalman Filter is adopted. In the online phase, a Coupled Markov Jump Particle Filter is proposed for Visual-Based Localization. This filter combines a set of Kalman Filters with a Particle Filter, allowing us to extract possible anomalies in the test scenario as well. The proposed method is integrated into a framework based on awareness theories, and is data-driven, hierarchical, probabilistic, and explainable. The method is evaluated on trajectories from four real-world datasets, i.e., two terrestrial and two aerial. The localization accuracy and explainability of the method are analyzed in detail. We achieve a mean localization accuracy in meters of 1.65, 0.98, 0.23, and 0.87, on the four datasets.",

      "abstract": "The development of efficient and reliable trajectory-planning strategies for swarms of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is an increasingly important area of research, with applications in surveillance, search and rescue, smart agriculture, defence operations, and communication networks. This article provides a comprehensive and critical review of the various techniques available for UAV swarm trajectory planning, which can be broadly categorised into three main groups: traditional algorithms, biologically inspired metaheuristics, and modern artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods. The study examines cutting-edge research, comparing key aspects of trajectory planning, including computational efficiency, scalability, inter-UAV coordination, energy consumption, and robustness in uncertain environments. The strengths and weaknesses of these algorithms are discussed in detail, particularly in the context of collision avoidance, adaptive decision making, and the balance between centralised and decentralised control. Additionally, the review highlights hybrid frameworks that combine the global optimisation power of bio-inspired algorithms with the real-time adaptability of AI-based approaches, aiming to achieve an effective exploration–exploitation trade-off in multi-agent environments. Lastly, the article addresses the major challenges in UAV swarm trajectory planning, including multidimensional trajectory spaces, nonlinear dynamics, and real-time adaptation. It also identifies promising directions for future research. This study serves as a valuable resource for researchers, engineers, and system designers working to develop UAV swarms for real-world, integrated, intelligent, and autonomous missions.",

Our methodology leverages generative models, specifically Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs), interaction dictionaries, and a Markov Jump Particle Filter (MJPF), to accurately classify objects within LiDAR point clouds and localize the ego vehicle without relying on external odometry data during testing. The classification phase effectively distinguishes between static and dynamic objects with high accuracy, achieving an F1 score of 91%. The localization phase utilizes a combined dictionary approach, integrating multiple static landmarks to improve robustness, particularly during simultaneous multi-track observations and no-observation intervals. Experimental results validate the efficacy of our proposed approach in enhancing localization accuracy and maintaining consistency in diverse scenarios",

      "abstract": "Learning from experience is a fundamental capability of intelligent agents. Autonomous systems rely on sensors that provide data about the environment and internal situations to their perception systems for learning and inference mechanisms. These systems can also learn Self-Aware and Situation-Aware generative modules from these data to localize themselves and interact with the environment. In this paper, we propose a self-aware cognitive architecture capable to perform tasks where the interactions between the self-state of an agent and the surrounding environment are explicitly and dynamically represented. We specifically develop a Deep Learning (DL) based Self-Aware interaction model, empowered by learning from Multi-Modal Perception (MMP) and World Models using multi-sensory data in a novel Multi-Agent Self-Awareness Architecture (MASAA). Two sub-modules are developed, the Situation Model (SM) and the First-Person model (FPM), that address different and interrelated aspects of the World Model (WM). The MMP model, instead, aims at learning the mapping of different sensory perceptions into Exteroceptive (EI) and Proprioceptive (PI) latent information. The WM then uses the learned MMP model as experience to predict dynamic self-behaviors and interaction patterns within the experienced environment. WM and MMP Models are learned in a data-driven way, starting from the lower-dimensional odometry data used to guide the learning of higher-dimensional video data, thus generating coupled Generalized State Hierarchical Dynamic Bayesian Networks (GS-HDBNs). We test our model on KITTI, CARLA, and iCab datasets, achieving high performance and a low average localization error (RMSE) of 2.897%, when considering two interacting agents.",

      "abstract": "The integration of autonomous aerial vehicles (AAVs), cognitive radio (CR), and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) presents a promising solution to significantly enhance the performance of future wireless networks. Achieving this integration requires cognitive self-awareness for intelligent resource allocation. In this paper, we address the problem of sum rate maximization in AAV-enabled cognitive NOMA uplink systems through the joint optimization of subchannel assignment and power allocation, while considering the AAV’s mobility. The traditional approach to finding the optimal solution requires an iterative or exhaustive search across all possible combinations of subchannel assignment, power allocation, and AAV position at each time slot, leading to excessive computational complexity. Furthermore, machine learning models, often trained on datasets that do not fully capture the complexity of real-world scenarios, struggle to handle non-stationary events effectively. To solve this nonconvex optimization challenge, we draw inspiration from active inference in cognitive neuroscience and propose a novel data-driven approach called the Active Generalized Dynamic Bayesian Network (Active-GDBN). The main idea is to process the unknown nonlinear input of an exhaustive search optimization algorithm using an Active-GDBN framework. This framework leverages a probabilistic generative model to learn the complex relationships and dependencies among subchannel assignments, power distributions, and the AAV’s mobility. The model is facilitated by continuous neuronal message passing in both discrete and continuous states to predict the optimal configuration. Numerical results show that the proposed approach achieves sum rate performance near the optimal exhaustive search and surpasses other baseline approaches.",

Drone positional information is crucial in indoor surveillance applications. So, to address this issue, this paper proposes a method for drone localization that uses onboard sensors (camera and IMUs) and ArUco markers placed in the environment. The positions estimated from Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) are combined with the ones from marker detection through a Kalman Filter (KF). Then, an external fixed Lidar sensor is employed to track the drone. This latter localization serves as a ground-truth for the former one, and for possible successive elaborations of the positional data. The two estimations are aligned and synchronized. The methodology is evaluated using a DJI FLY 2S drone and an Ouster OS1 Lidar in a closed environment.",

      "abstract": "Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms are increasingly recognized for their versatility and affordability. These swarms have enhanced various applications, including agriculture, surveillance, delivery services, and monitoring. However, fully utilizing the capabilities of UAV swarms requires addressing challenges related to trajectory design, particularly the Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem (MTSP). It involves optimizing the paths of multiple UAVs while avoiding collisions, minimizing overlap and interference, and managing the overall size of the swarm. These challenges highlight the complexities involved in developing high-performance, organized UAV swarm operations. We propose a novel approach based on repulsion force in UAV swarm trajectory design to tackle these issues. Our method utilizes a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to generate a dynamic Repulsion Force (RF) that optimizes the distance between UAVs and the size of the swarm. This approach reduces interference and overlap while effectively navigating the limitations posed by the MTSP. Our proposed solution aims to design efficient trajectories that enhance the overall performance of UAV swarms. We compared our proposed method to existing algorithms, including the MTSPGA, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), 2-OPT, Ant Colony (AC) Optimization, and Simulated Annealing (SA), using simulations and evaluations. The results indicate that our proposed method effectively optimizes travel distances and times, reduces interference levels and overlapping, prevents collisions between UAVs, and enhances the size of the UAV swarm. Overall, our method outperforms current approaches, demonstrating its effectiveness for UAV-based applications.",

This paper explores using a UAV as an autonomous agent, navigating over multiple hotspots to serve ground users (GUs) and maximize data transmission rates through strategic trajectory design. Existing interpretability methods often prove insufficient in providing comprehensive insights and generating logical, sequential decisions. In this paper, we propose an explainable reinforcement learning framework designed to produce interpretable and verifiable agent policies. Our method starts with an expert optimizer to solve training examples, enabling the learning agent (UAV) to analyse the solutions. Furthermore, we employ inverse reinforcement learning for data-driven reward function estimation. Additionally, we use a probabilistic Qtable function to understand and explain the actions executed by the expert across diverse environmental contexts, allowing the learning agent to produce interpretable policies that meet reasonable performance goals and easily transferred to unseen environments. Preliminary results indicate that the proposed approach is promising in achieving explainability in RL agents.",

      "abstract": "Being able to robustly interact with and navigate a dynamic environment has been a long-standing challenge in intelligent transportation systems. Autonomous agents can use models that mimic the human brain to learn how to respond to other participants’ actions in the environment and proactively coordinate with the dynamics. Modeling brain learning procedures is challenging for multiple reasons, such as stochasticity, multimodality, and unobservant intents. Active inference may be defined as the Bayesian modeling of a brain with a biologically plausible model of the agent. Its primary idea relies on the free energy principle and the prior preference of the agent. It enables the agent to choose an action that leads to its preferred future observations. An exploring action-oriented model is introduced to address the inference complexity and solve the exploration–exploitation dilemma in unobserved environments. It is conducted by adapting active inference to an imitation learning approach and finding a theoretical connection between them. We present a multimodal self-awareness architecture for autonomous driving systems where the proposed techniques are evaluated on their ability to model proper driving behavior. Experimental results provide the basis for the intelligent driving system to make more human-like decisions and improve agent performance to avoid a collision.",

      "abstract": "In recent years we have seen a significant increase in research on autonomous vehicles, which is attracting considerable attention because of its potential to revolutionize transportation. In this paper, a method is presented for classifying static and dynamic tracks in autonomous vehicles using odometry and LiDAR data. Using the multi-target tracking algorithm, we are able to detect and track objects with high precision. We used an unsupervised clustering algorithm to create innovative interaction models, which will be employed for vehicle localization in the future. Because clustering is based upon time and spatial proximity, we are able to create interaction models using dynamic bayesian networks (DBNs) that allow us to classify and differentiate static from dynamic tracks. Based on our method, we achieve an accuracy of 87% in distinguishing between static and dynamic obstacles, thereby enhancing navigation by identifying and differentiating different types of obstacles efficiently.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a dynamic data-driven approach for efficient anomaly detection, extraction, and fusion of multiple heterogeneous anomaly models in a generative fashion. First, we propose an adaptive Bayesian filtering technique based on a combination of Null force hypothesis and Particle filtering to accurately track the trajectories of normal and abnormal cases. We then analyze the generalized vectors and clusters generated from adaptive filtering and sequential clustering procedures to effectively detect areas with high abnormalities. To achieve this, we use probabilistic distance measurements. Finally, to increase the agent's vocabulary, we fuse different anomaly distributions to generate coupled anomaly models that allow the agent to have incremental learning capabilities. Our approach is completely data-driven and does not require any previous knowledge of the data or the environment. We show that our proposed method can effectively detect anomalies using low-dimensional odometry data and can eventually improve itself over time through iterative generation of fused anomaly models.",

      "abstract": "Intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) provide a paradigm change in perceiving and interacting with transportation networks, leading to enhanced levels of safety, sustainability, and efficiency. Vehicular-to-everything (V2X) communication is the core component in the ITSs. The proprioceptive and exteroceptive sensors allow these vehicles to be aware of the surrounding environment and respond to emergencies by utilizing their abilities to reach a high level of self-awareness. In this paper, we propose a self-awareness approach to learn a generative dynamic Bayesian network (G-DBN) from the real-time LiDAR perception. Without reducing the dimensionality, we perform offline training and online testing phases on the three-dimensional (3D) point clouds. In the offline training phase, initially, the raw point clouds are preprocessed using a joint probabilistic data association filter (JPDAF) to obtain the 3D tracks of the multiple vehicles in space. Then, we perform an unsupervised clustering on all the generalized states (GSs) containing positions and velocities (a 6D vector) by considering the growing neural gas (GNG) technique, thus achieving a trained model from the 3D LiDAR point clouds. In the online testing phase, the high-dimensional Markov jump particle filter (HD-MJPF) utilizes the G-DBN's probabilistic information to predict the positions of multiple vehicles and to detect the abnormalities at the discrete and continuous levels in normal and abnormal scenarios. Our proposed approach is useful for learning high-dimensional generative models and provides a way to meet the current curse of dimensionality challenges, that machine learning models are suffering.",

      "abstract": "Generalizability and interpretability are common terminologies that can be found in today's machine learning algorithm design. Generalizability requires a clear understanding of one's own action (self-awareness) and a robust interaction with the environment (situation awareness). Many current studies are devoted in developing an algorithm that is more robust in generalizing unseen situations while explaining self-action. However, such algorithms are complex and are not yet fully developed to be used in production. Intelligent transportation systems like self-driving cars are one of the emerging technologies that need generalizability and explainability in anomalous conditions. We propose to enhance generalizability and interpretability of a self-driving car model by introducing a novel methodology that fuses multi-sensorial data from proprioceptive and exteroceptive sensors of an agent, coupled in a Hierarchical Dynamic Bayesian Network model, in an Active Inference framework. The developed model has three stages: 1) a lower dimensional unsupervised learning stage, considering odometry and action modalities, carried out by first applying Null Force Filtering and then by applying modified GNG clustering algorithms; 2) a self-supervised higher-dimensional video modality learning stage assisted by the learned odometry vocabularies; and 3) an online model-based active learning in continuous and discrete state spaces, and action spaces, in the Active Inference framework. The developed system is tested using the CARLA simulator environment for localizing interacting agents, and exhibits low error compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

Our approach uses a Markov Jump Particle Filter (MJPF) to process the odometry data of a vehicle, extracting its features and identifying instant anomalies. Simultaneously, the object causing the anomaly is detected and tracked in the video data. After that, the correlation between the odometric trajectories and the object trajectories is determined in both normal and abnormal cases. Another correlation coefficient is then employed to calculate the distance between the computed correlations. The proposed method is evaluated using multi-modal data collected from a vehicle operating in a closed environment, where pedestrians represent anomalies.

      "abstract": "Deploying unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as aerial base stations is an exceptional approach to reinforce terrestrial infrastructure owing to their remarkable flexibility and superior agility. However, it is essential to design their flight trajectory effectively to make the most of UAV-assisted wireless communications. This paper presents a novel method for improving wireless connectivity between UAVs and terrestrial users through effective path planning. This is achieved by developing a goal-directed trajectory planning method using active inference. First, we create a global dictionary using traveling salesman problem with profits (TSPWP) instances executed on various training examples. This dictionary represents the world model and contains letters representing available hotspots, tokens representing local paths, and words depicting complete trajectories and hotspot order. By using this world model, the UAV can understand the TSPWP’s decision-making grammar and how to use the available letters to form tokens and words at various levels of abstraction and time scales. With this knowledge, the UAV can assess encountered situations and deduce optimal routes based on the belief encoded in the world model. Our proposed method outperforms traditional Q-learning by providing fast, stable, and reliable solutions with good generalization ability.",

      "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on advanced sensory systems, such as Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), to function seamlessly in intricate and dynamic environments. LiDAR produces highly accurate 3D point clouds, which are vital for the detection, classification, and tracking of multiple targets. A systematic review and classification of various clustering and Multi-Target Tracking (MTT) techniques are necessary due to the inherent challenges posed by LiDAR data, such as density, noise, and varying sampling rates. As part of this study, the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology was employed to examine the challenges and advancements in MTT techniques and clustering for LiDAR point clouds within the context of autonomous driving. Searches were conducted in major databases such as IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, ACM Digital Library, and Google Scholar, utilizing customized search strategies. We identified and critically reviewed 76 relevant studies based on rigorous screening and evaluation processes, assessing their methodological quality, data handling adequacy, and reporting compliance. As a result of this comprehensive review and classification, we were able to provide a detailed overview of current challenges, research gaps, and advancements in clustering and MTT techniques for LiDAR point clouds, thus contributing to the field of autonomous driving. Researchers and practitioners working in the field of autonomous driving will benefit from this study, which was characterized by transparency and reproducibility on a systematic basis.",

      "abstract": "Given the surge in wireless data traffic driven by the emerging Internet of Things (IoT), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), cognitive radio (CR), and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) have been recognized as promising techniques to overcome massive connectivity issues. As a result, there is an increasing need to intelligently improve the channel capacity of future wireless networks. Motivated by active inference from cognitive neuroscience, this paper investigates joint subchannel and power allocation for an uplink UAV-assisted cognitive NOMA network. Maximizing the sum rate is often a highly challenging optimization problem due to dynamic network conditions and power constraints. To address this challenge, we propose an active inference-based algorithm. We transform the sum rate maximization problem into abnormality minimization by utilizing a generalized state-space model to characterize the time-changing network environment. The problem is then solved using an Active Generalized Dynamic Bayesian Network (Active-GDBN). The proposed framework consists of an offline perception stage, in which a UAV employs a hierarchical GDBN structure to learn an optimal generative model of discrete sub channels and continuous power allocation. In the online active inference stage, the UAV dynamically selects discrete sub channels and continuous power to maximize the sum rate of secondary users. By leveraging the errors in each episode, the UAV can adapt its resource allocation policies and belief updating to improve its performance over time. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in terms of cumulative sum rate compared to benchmark schemes.",

      "abstract": "Future wireless networks will need to improve adaptive resource allocation and decision-making to handle the increasing number of intelligent devices. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are being explored for their potential in real-time decision-making. Moreover, cognitive non-orthogonal multiple access (Cognitive-NOMA) is envisioned as a remedy to address spectrum scarcity and enable massive connectivity. This paper investigates the design of joint subchannel and power allocation in an uplink UAV-based cognitive NOMA network. We aim to maximize the cumulative sum rate by jointly optimizing the subchannel and power allocation based on the UAV's mobility at each time step. This is often formulated as an optimization problem with random variables. However, conventional optimization algorithms normally introduce significant complexity, and machine learning methods often rely on large but partially representative datasets to build solution models, assuming stationary testing data. Consequently, inference strategies for non stationary events are often overlooked. In this study, we introduce a novel active inference-based learning approach, rooted in cognitive neuroscience, to solve this complex problem. The framework involves creating a training dataset using random or iterative methods to find suboptimal resource allocations. This dataset trains a mobile UAV offline, enabling it to learn a generative model of discrete subchannels and continuous power allocation. The UAV then uses this model for online inference. The method incrementally derives new generative models from training data by identifying dynamic equilibrium conditions between required actions and variables, represented within a unique dynamic Bayesian network. The proposed approach is validated through numerical simulations, showing efficient performance compared to suboptimal baseline schemes.",

      "abstract": "Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication is expected to be a prominent component of the sixth generation (6G) to accomplish intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Autonomous vehicles relying only on onboard sensors cannot bypass the limitations of safety and reliability. Thus, integrated sensing and communication is proposed as an effective way to achieve high situational- and self-awareness levels, enabling V2X to perceive the physical world and adjust its behaviour to emergencies. Secure navigation through the Global Positioning System (GPS) is essential in ITS for safe operation. Nevertheless, due to the lack of encryption and authentication mechanisms of civil GPS receivers, spoofers can easily replicate satellite signals by launching GPS spoofing attacks to deceive the vehicle and manipulate navigation data. In addition, due to its shared nature, V2X links are prone to jamming attacks which might endanger vehicular safety. This paper proposes a method to jointly detect GPS spoofing and jamming attacks in a V2X network. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can detect spoofers and jammers with high detection probabilities.",

      "abstract": "The combination of different sensory information to predict upcoming situations is an innate capability of intelligent beings. Consequently, various studies in the Artificial Intelligence field are currently being conducted to transfer this ability to artificial systems. Autonomous vehicles can particularly benefit from the combination of multi-modal information from the different sensors of the agent. This paper proposes a method for video-frame prediction that leverages odometric data. It can then serve as a basis for anomaly detection. A Dynamic Bayesian Network framework is adopted, combined with the use of Deep Learning methods to learn an appropriate latent space. First, a Markov Jump Particle Filter is built over the odometric data. This odometry model comprises a set of clusters. As a second step, the video model is learned. It is composed of a Kalman Variational Autoencoder modified to leverage the odometry clusters for focusing its learning attention on features related to the dynamic tasks that the vehicle is performing. We call the obtained overall model Cluster-Guided Kalman Variational Autoencoder. Evaluation is conducted using data from a car moving in a closed environment and leveraging a part of the University of Alcalá DriveSet dataset, where several drivers move in a normal and drowsy way along a secondary road.",

The model is grounded in a principled framework to learn and cognize the dynamic surrounding of a learning agent, which exemplifies the model’s functioning by presenting a simulation of overtaking scenarios in autonomous driving. The learning agent integrates imitation learning and active inference to form hierarchical representations from expert demonstrations. During the online learning phase, the learning agent improves the action selection procedure based on the prior knowledge (exploiting) and the novel interactions with a dynamic environment (exploring). The proposed method applies an active knowledge sampling during the learning agent’s movements to make a dynamic inference in the Bayesian structure by message passing through the multi-levels. A line-changing driving scenario with different levels of complexity is organized to verify the proposed framework’s efficiency by dealing with single and multiple dynamic objects interacting in the environment.",

      "abstract": "The integration of Cognitive Radio (CR) with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is an effective step towards relieving the spectrum scarcity and empowering the UAV with a high degree of intelligence. The dynamic nature of CR and the dominant line-of-sight links of UAVs poses serious security challenges and make the CR-UAV prone to a variety of attacks as malicious jamming. Joint jammer detection and automatic jammer classification is a powerful approach against the physical layer threats by identifying multiple jammers attacking the network that realize a crucial stage towards efficient interference management. This paper proposes a novel method for joint detection and automatic classification of multiple jammers attacking with different modulation schemes. The method is based on learning a representation of the radio environment encoded in a Generalized Dynamic Bayesian Network (GDBN) whilst multiple GDBN models represent various jamming signals under different modulation schemes. The CR-UAV performs multiple predictions online in parallel and evaluates multiple abnormality measurements based on a Modified Markov Jump Particle Filter (M-MJPF) to select the best-fit model that explains the detected jammer and recognize the modulation scheme accordingly. The simulated results demonstrate that the proposed GDBN-based method outperforms Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Stacked Autoencoder (SAE) in terms of classification accuracy and achieves a higher degree of explainability of its own decisions by interpreting causes and effects at hierarchical levels under the Bayesian learning and reasoning processes.",

LiDAR is assumed to be an exteroceptive sensor that allows the vehicle to have dynamic 3D scene perception of its surroundings. We employ an encoder-decoder architecture based on 3D-Convolutional layers called 3D Convolution Encoder-Decoder (3D-CED), together with a transfer learning strategy to extract a set of features from point clouds, which are relevant in the context of autonomous driving. The resulting features allow to make inferences of the future point cloud data and detect multiple abstraction level anomalies in controlled scenarios by utilizing a probabilistic switching dynamic model called High Dimensional Markov Jump Particle Filter (HD-MJPF). Moreover, a comparison is provided between piecewise linear, piecewise nonlinear, and nonlinear predictive models for anomaly detection at multiple abstraction levels. Our approach is evaluated with data collected from the LiDAR sensors of the autonomous vehicle while performing certain tasks in a controlled environment.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose to introduce an emergent Self-Awareness (SA) module at the physical layer (PHY) in Cognitive Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Radios to improve PHY security, especially against jamming attacks. SA is based on learning a hierarchical representation of the radio environment by means of a proposed Hierarchical Dynamic Bayesian Network (HDBN). It is shown how the acquired knowledge from previous experiences facilitate the radio spectrum perception and allow the radio to detect abnormal behaviours caused by jamming attacks. Detecting abnormalities realize a fundamental step towards growing up incrementally the radio's long-term memory. Deviations from predictions estimated during abnormal situations are used to characterize jammers at multiple levels and discover their dynamic behavioural rules. Besides, a proactive consequence can be drawn after estimating the jammer's signal to act efficiently by mitigating its effects on the received stimuli. Simulation results show that the introduction of the novel SA functionalities with the proposed HDBN framework provides the high accuracy of characterizing, detecting and predicting the jammer's activities.",

      "abstract": "In recent days, it is becoming essential to ensure that the outcomes of signal processing methods based on machine learning (ML) data-driven models can provide interpretable predictions. The interpretability of ML models can be defined as the capability to understand the reasons that contributed to generating a given outcome in a complex autonomous or semi-autonomous system. The necessity of interpretability is often related to the evaluation of performances in complex systems and the acceptance of agents’ automatization processes where critical high-risk decisions have to be taken. This paper concentrates on one of the core functionality of such systems, i.e., abnormality detection, and on choosing a model representation modality based on a data-driven machine learning (ML) technique such that the outcomes become interpretable. The interpretability in this work is achieved through graph matching of semantic level vocabulary generated from the data and their relationships. The proposed approach assumes that the data-driven models to be chosen should support emergent self-awareness (SA) of the agents at multiple abstraction levels. It is demonstrated that the capability of incrementally updating learned representation models based on progressive experiences of the agent is shown to be strictly related to interpretability capability. As a case study, abnormality detection is analyzed as a primary feature of the collective awareness (CA) of a network of vehicles performing cooperative behaviors. Each vehicle is considered an example of an Internet of Things (IoT) node, therefore providing results that can be generalized to an IoT framework where agents have different sensors, actuators, and tasks to be accomplished. The capability of a model to allow evaluation of abnormalities at different levels of abstraction in the learned models is addressed as a key aspect for interpretability.",

Anomalies w.r.t. expected vehicle motion and image content are extracted to guide the localization, signal when the localization results are not trustworthy and explain the reason for the failure. During the training phase, a Dynamic Bayesian Network model is learned, which couples positional and video data. To learn it, clustering is performed on the odometry data, and a modified Kalman Variational Autoencoder is built over the video data. During the testing phase, a Coupled Markov Jump Particle Filter leverages the learned Dynamic Bayesian Network to extract anomalies and to estimate the vehicle's position, given only camera data. The proposed method is evaluated on two real-world datasets of a vehicle performing perimeter monitoring of a closed environment and of a shopping cart moving in a supermarket.",

      "abstract": "Learning from expert demonstrations effectively reduces the number of interactions required to train a policy between the learning agent and its environment. Where agent-environment interactions can be costly, reinforcement learning is critical, and imitation learning suffers significantly from learning hierarchical policies when the imitative agent encounters an unobserved state by the expert agent. We propose a probabilistic incremental imitation learning method that employs a Dynamic Bayesian Network to encode observed teaching-agent's behaviors. The presented model grows and matures based on imitation loss formulation at a discrete level in the online learning procedure. The learning agent is trained by using long-term predictions from the generative learning model to replicate the teacher's motion while learning how to choose an appropriate action through new experiences. Our results affirm that a Dynamic Bayesian optimal approach provides a principled framework and outperforms conventional reinforcement learning methods.",

      "abstract": "Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) is an emergent technol-ogy for enhancing traffic efficiency, road safety and autonomous driving. Vehicles interconnected with their prevalent wireless environment are prone to various security threats that might affect traffic and life safety immensely. Jamming attacks, a legacy and dated problem, still persists much to the havoc of V2X communications. The following paper proposes a framework for jammer detection adapted to V2X communications scenario. A Generalized Dynamic Bayesian network is used to learn the V2X signal environment in a statistical manner. Subsequently, a Modified Markov Jump Particle filter (M-MJPF) is used for signal predictions where the innovations in the observed signal versus the predicted signal enable our framework to detect the jammer. Simulation results highlight the efficacy and accuracy of our approach in V2X jammer detection.",

      "abstract": "Classical imitation learning methods suffer substantially from the learning hierarchical policies when the imitative agent faces an unobserved state by the expert agent. To address these drawbacks, we propose an online active learning through active inference approach that encodes the expert's demonstrations based on observation-action to improve the learner's future motion prediction. For this purpose, we provide a switching Dynamic Bayesian Network based on the dynamic interaction between the expert agent and another object in its surrounding as a reference model, which we exploit to initialize an incremental probabilistic learning model. This learning model grows and matures based on the free-energy formulation and message passing of active inference dynamically at discrete and continuous levels in an online active learning phase. In this scheme, generalized states of the learning world are represented as distance-vector, where it is the learner's observation concerning its interaction with a moving object. Considering the distance vector entail intentions, it enables action prediction evaluation in a prospective sense. We illustrate these points using simulations of driving intelligent agents. The learning agent is trained by using long-term predictions from the generative learning model to reproduce the expert's motion while learning how to select a suitable action through new experiences. Our results affirm that a Dynamic Bayesian optimal approach provides a principled framework and outperforms conventional reinforcement learning methods. Furthermore, it endorses the general formulation of action prediction as active inference.",

This paper combines Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) and Neural Networks (NNs) and proposes a method for detecting anomalies in video data at different abstraction levels. We use a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to reduce the dimensionality of video frames, and Optical Flows between subsequent images, generating a latent space that captures both visual and dynamical information and that is comparable to low-dimensional sensory data (e.g., positioning, steering angle). An Adapted Markov Jump Particle Filter is employed to predict the following frames and detect anomalies in video data.

      "abstract": "A novel approach is presented for learning probabilistic transition matrices from temporal data series as switching models based on Generalized States (GS). An observed data sequence is analyzed by a reference filter whose errors are clustered. Each cluster is associated with a dynamic flow model, which described as a parametric linear attractor. The set of linear attractors define the Hierarchical Generalized Dynamic Bayesian Network (H-GDBN), which encodes a learned model of the obtained sequence. A Markov Jump Particle Filter (MJPF) uses H-GDBN's probabilistic information to make inferences at a multilevel scale and facilitates the detection of abnormalities. This paper shows how transition matrices can be obtained as an integral part of the clustering step by employing the advantages of GSs, enabling a unique optimal criterion for learning flow models at discrete and continuous levels of H-GDBN. For evaluating the proposed method, odometry and proprioceptive control data from an autonomous vehicle are employed to learn H-GDBNs. Learned H-GDBN are used to detect abnormalities when vehicle encounter any abnormal situation. Performance evaluation based on ROC curves is provided to select the optimal transition matrix.",

Detecting an abnormal motion of objects using video sequences has been widely studied in the last decade. This paper proposes a method to detect abnormal motion by using sequences of LiDARs' point-clouds. Estimation of scene flows enables to compute the motion field in 3D space. Nearest point loss and Cosine-Cycle Consistency loss are proposed to estimate the scene flows of point-clouds in an unsupervised way. The direction of motion of the nearest object is represented in a 3D grid-like structure called VoxCF. VoxCF is used as an input for the extraction of dynamic features that encode the direction of objects' motion. Dynamic features are used to make decisions about the abnormal motion by making predictions from the Long short-term Memory (LSTM) network. The proposed method has been validated by performing real experiments with AV, and the obtained results show the precise detection of abnormal motion.",

The proposed system employs the inverse reinforcement learning method to a coupled Dynamic Bayesian Network to facilitate dynamic learning in an interactive system. This method studies the interaction at both discrete and continuous levels by identifying inter-relationships between the objects to facilitate the prediction of an expert agent. We evaluate the learning procedure in the scene of learner agent based on probabilistic reward function. Our goal is to estimate policies that predict matched trajectories with the observed one by minimizing the Kullback-Leiber divergence.

      "abstract": "The technology for autonomous vehicles is close to replacing human drivers by artificial systems endowed with high-level decision-making capabilities. In this regard, systems must learn about the usual vehicle's behavior to predict imminent difficulties before they happen. An autonomous agent should be capable of continuously interacting with multi-modal dynamic environments while learning unseen novel concepts. Such environments are not often available to train the agent on it, so the agent should have an understanding of its own capacities and limitations. This understanding is usually called self-awareness. This paper proposes a multi-modal self-awareness modeling of signals coming from different sources. This paper shows how different machine learning techniques can be used under a generic framework to learn single modality models by using Dynamic Bayesian Networks. In the presented case, a probabilistic switching model and a bank of generative adversarial networks are employed to model a vehicle's positional and visual information respectively. Our results include experiments performed on a real vehicle, highlighting the potentiality of the proposed approach at detecting abnormalities in real scenarios.",

      "abstract": "A novel approach is proposed for multimodal collective awareness (CA) of multiple networked intelligent agents. Each agent is here considered as an Internet-of-Things (IoT) node equipped with machine learning capabilities; CA aims to provide the network with updated causal knowledge of the state of execution of actions of each node performing a joint task, with particular attention to anomalies that can arise. Data-driven dynamic Bayesian models learned from multisensory data recorded during the normal realization of a joint task (agent network experience) are used for distributed state estimation of agents and detection of abnormalities. A set of switching dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) models collectively learned in a training phase, each related to particular sensorial modality, is used to allow each agent in the network to perform synchronous estimation of possible abnormalities occurring when a new task of the same type is jointly performed. Collective DBN (CDBN) learning is performed by unsupervised clustering of generalized errors (GEs) obtained from a starting generalized model. A growing neural gas (GNG) algorithm is used as a basis to learn the discrete switching variables at the semantic level. Conditional probabilities linking nodes in the CDBN models are estimated using obtained clusters. CDBN models are associated with a Bayesian inference method, namely, distributed Markov jump particle filter (D-MJPF), employed for joint state estimation and abnormality detection. The effects of networking protocols and of communications in the estimation of state and abnormalities are analyzed. Performance is evaluated by using a small network of two autonomous vehicles performing joint navigation tasks in a controlled environment. In the proposed method, first the sharing of observations is considered in ideal condition, and then the effects of a wireless communication channel have been analyzed for the collective abnormality estimation of the agents. Rician wireless channel and the usage of two protocols (i.e., IEEE 802.11p and IEEE 802.15.4) along with different channel conditions are considered as well.",

These techniques represent an essential step also for artificial self-aware systems that can continually learn from new situations. In this chapter, we present a semisupervised method for the detection of anomalies for this type of self-aware agents. The described method leverages the message-passing capability of Generalized Dynamic Bayesian Networks (GDBNs) to provide anomalies at different abstraction levels for diverse types of time-series data (i.e., both low-dimensional and high-dimensional). The detected anomalies could consequently be employed to enable the system to evolve by integrating the new acquired knowledge. To present a case study for the description of the anomaly detection method, we propose to use multisensory data from a semiautonomous vehicle performing different tasks in a closed environment.",

      "abstract": "The evolution of Intelligent Transportation Systems in recent times necessitates the development of self-awareness in agents. Before the intensive use of Machine Learning, the detection of abnormalities was manually programmed by checking every variable and creating huge nested conditions that are very difficult to track. This paper aims to introduce a novel method to develop self-awareness in autonomous vehicles that mainly focuses on detecting abnormal situations around the considered agents. Multi-sensory time-series data from the vehicles are used to develop the data-driven Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) models used for future state prediction and the detection of dynamic abnormalities. Moreover, an initial level collective awareness model that can perform joint anomaly detection in co-operative tasks is proposed. The GNG algorithm learns the DBN models’ discrete node variables; probabilistic transition links connect the node variables. A Markov Jump Particle Filter (MJPF) is applied to predict future states and detect when the vehicle is potentially misbehaving using learned DBNs as filter parameters. In this paper, datasets from real experiments of autonomous vehicles performing various tasks used to learn and test a set of switching DBN models.",

In this context, Cognitive Radio (CR) is capable of managing the mmWave spectrum sharing efficiently. However, Cognitive mmWave Radios are vulnerable to malicious users due to the complex dynamic radio environment and the shared access medium. This indicates the necessity to implement techniques able to detect precisely any anomalous behaviour in the spectrum to build secure and efficient radios. In this work, we propose a comparison framework between deep generative models: Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (C-GAN), Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Network (AC-GAN), and Variational Auto Encoder (VAE) used to detect anomalies inside the dynamic radio spectrum. For the sake of the evaluation, a real mmWave dataset is used, and results show that all of the models achieve high probability in detecting spectrum anomalies. Especially, AC-GAN that outperforms C-GAN and VAE in terms of accuracy and probability of detection.",

      "abstract": "Cellular connectivity for a massive number of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) will overcrowd the radio spectrum and cause spectrum scarcity. Incorporating Cognitive Radio (CR) with UAVs (Cognitive-UAV-Radios) has been proposed to overcome such an issue. However, the broadcasting nature of CR and the dominant line-of-sight links of UAV makes the Cognitive-UAV-Radios susceptible to jamming attacks. In this paper, we propose a framework to detect smart jammer, which locates and attacks the UAV commands with low Jamming-to-Signal-Power-Ratio (JSR). Smart jammer is more challenging than the types of jammers that always require high power values. Our work focuses on learning a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) to model and analyze the signals' behaviour statistically. A Markov Jump Particle Filter (MJPF) is employed to perform predictions and consequently detect jamming signals. The results are satisfactory in terms of detection probability and false alarm rate that outperform the conventional Energy Detector approach.",

This article introduces a bio-inspired framework for generative and descriptive dynamic models that support SA computationally and efficiently. Generative models facilitate predicting future states, while descriptive models enable the selection of the representation that best fits the current observation. Our framework is founded on the analysis and extension of three bio-inspired theories that have studied SA from different viewpoints, and we demonstrate how probabilistic techniques, such as cognitive dynamic Bayesian networks and generalized filtering paradigms, can learn appropriate models from multidimensional proprioceptive and exteroceptive signals acquired by the autonomous system. We discuss essential capabilities for SA and show how our modeling framework supports these capabilities in theory and through a case study where a mobile robot uses multisensorial data to determine its internal and environmental state as well as distinguishing among normal and abnormal behaviors.",

      "abstract": "The advancements in connected and autonomous vehicles in these times demand the availability of tools providing the agents with the capability to be aware and predict their own states and context dynamics. This article presents a novel approach to develop an initial level of collective awareness (CA) in a network of intelligent agents. A specific collective self-awareness functionality is considered, namely, agent-centered detection of abnormal situations present in the environment around any agent in the network. Moreover, the agent should be capable of analyzing how such abnormalities can influence the future actions of each agent. Data-driven dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) models learned from time series of sensory data recorded during the realization of tasks (agent network experiences) are here used for abnormality detection and prediction. A set of DBNs, each related to an agent, is used to allow the agents in the network to reach synchronously aware possible abnormalities occurring when available models are used on a new instance of the task for which DBNs have been learned. A growing neural gas (GNG) algorithm is used to learn the node variables and conditional probabilities linking nodes in the DBN models; a Markov jump particle filter (MJPF) is employed for state estimation and abnormality detection in each agent using learned DBNs as filter parameters. Performance metrics are discussed to asses the algorithm's reliability and accuracy. The impact is also evaluated by the communication channel used by the network to share the data sensed in a distributed way by each agent of the network. The IEEE 802.11p protocol standard has been considered for communication among agents. Performances of the DBN-based abnormality detection models under different channel and source conditions are discussed. The effects of distances among agents and of the delays and packet losses are analyzed in different scenario categories (urban, suburban, and rural). Real data sets are also used acquired by autonomous vehicles performing different tasks in a controlled environment.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes a method to detect abnormal motions in real vehicle situations based on trajectory data. Our approach uses a Gaussian process (GP) regression that facilitates to approximate expected vehicle's movements over a whole environment based on sparse observed data. The main contribution of this paper consists in decomposing the GP regression into spatial zones, where quasi-constant velocity models are valid. Such obtained models are employed to build a set of Kalman filters that encode observed vehicle's dynamics. This paper shows how proposed filters enable the online identification of abnormal motions. Detected abnormalities can be modeled and learned incrementally, automatically by intelligent systems. The proposed methodology is tested on real data produced by a vehicle that interacts with pedestrians in a closed environment. Automatic detection of abnormal motions benefits the traffic scene understanding and facilitates to close the gap between human driving and autonomous vehicle awareness.",

Such users can manipulate the radio spectrum in order to make the CR learn wrong behaviours and take mistaken actions. A basic SA module includes the ability to learn generative models and detect abnormalities inside the radio spectrum. In this work, we propose and implement Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based Abnormality Detection techniques at the physical (PHY)-layer in CR enabled by learning Generative Models. Specifically, two real-world practical applications related to different data dimensionality and sampling rates are presented. The first application implements the Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (C-GAN) investigated on generalized state vectors extracted from spectrum representation samples to study the dynamic behaviour of the wideband signal. While the second application is based on learning a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) model from a generalized state vector which contains sub-bands information extracted from the radio spectrum. Results show that both of the proposed methods are capable of detecting abnormal signals in the spectrum and pave the road towards Self-Aware radio.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) attracted both industry and research community owing to their fascinating features like mobility, deployment flexibility and strong Line of Sight (LoS) links. The integration of Cognitive Radio (CR) can greatly help UAVs to overcome several issues especially spectrum scarcity. However, the dynamic radio environment in CR and the strong dependence of safe communications from LoS channels integrity in UAV communications make the Cognitive- UAV-Radio vulnerable to jamming attacks. This work aims to study the integration of CR and UAVs introducing a Self- Awareness (SA) framework from the physical layer security perspective. Under the SA framework, a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) model is proposed as a representation of the radio environment and a modified Markov Jump Particle Filter (MJPF) is employed for prediction and state estimation purposes. A novel jammer detection framework is proposed that allows the UAV to perform abnormality evaluation at different hierarchical levels. The jammer is shown to be located effectively in both time and frequency domains. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed framework in terms of detection probability and accuracy.",

      "abstract": "The evolution of Intelligent Transportation System in recent times necessitates the development of self-driving agents: the self-awareness consciousness. This paper aims to introduce a novel method to detect abnormalities based on internal cross-correlation parameters of the vehicle. Before the implementation of Machine Learning, the detection of abnormalities were manually programmed by checking every variable and creating huge nested conditions that are very difficult to track. Nowadays, it is possible to train a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) model to automatically evaluate and detect when the vehicle is potentially misbehaving. In this paper, different scenarios have been set in order to train and test a switching DBN for Perimeter Monitoring Task using a semantic segmentation for the DBN model and Hellinger Distance metric for abnormality measurements.",

A functional that favors precise linear dynamical models in large state space regions is considered for optimization purposes.

      "abstract": "Self-learning abilities in autonomous systems are essential to improve their situational awareness and detection of normal/abnormal situations. In this work, we propose a graph matching technique for activity detection in autonomous agents by using the Gromov-Wasserstein framework. A clustering approach is used to discretise continuous agents' states related to a specific task into a set of nodes with similar objectives. Additionally, a probabilistic transition matrix between nodes is used as edges weights to build a graph. In this paper, we extract an abnormal area based on a sub-graph that encodes the differences between coupled of activities. Such sub-graph is obtained by applying a threshold on the optimal transport matrix, which is obtained through the graph matching procedure. The obtained results are evaluated through experiments performed by a robot in a simulated environment and by a real autonomous vehicle moving within a University Campus.",

This paper presents a method that facilitates the incremental learning of new models by an agent.

Observed mismatches are grouped through an unsupervised learning strategy into different classes, each of them corresponding to a dynamic model in a given region of the state space. Such clusters define switching Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) employed for predicting future instances and detect anomalies.

IoT devices have to be equipped with cognitive capabilities to enhance spectrum utilization by sensing and learning the surrounding environment.

      "abstract": "Technologies such as cognitive radio and dynamic spectrum access rely on spectrum sensing which provides wireless devices with information about the radio spectrum in the surrounding environment. One of the main challenges in wireless communications is the interference caused by malicious users on the shared spectrum. In this manuscript, an artificial intelligence enabled cognitive radio framework is proposed at system-level as part of a cyclic spectrum intelligence algorithm for interference mitigation in wideband radios. It exploits the cyclostationary feature of signals to differentiate users with different modulation schemes and an artificial neural network as classifier to detect potential malicious users. A dataset consisting of experimental modulated and dynamic signals is recorded by spectrum measurements with an in-house software defined radio testbed and then processed. Cyclostationary features are extracted for each detected signal and fed to a neural network classifier as training and testing data in a complex and dynamic scenario. Results highlight a classification rate of $∼1$ 1 in most of cases, even at low transmission power. A comparison with two previous works with hand-crafted features, which employ an energy detector-based classifier and a naive Bayes-based classifier, respectively, is discussed.",

The proposed method is based on the analysis of location data from different moving objects that modify their dynamics according to rules of interactions, namely attractive and repulsive forces governing objects' motions in a scene. Our method uses a Bayesian structure to identify key elements of the interplay rules and facilitates the prediction of objects' dynamics as an interacting system. Such a prediction facilitates the detection of abnormalities by identifying unseen interaction effects in the scene.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach to detect abnormalities in dynamic systems based on multisensory data and feature selection. The proposed method produces multiple inference models by considering several features of the observed data. This work facilitates the obtainment of the most precise features for predicting future instances and detecting abnormalities. Growing neural gas (GNG) is employed for clustering multisensory data into a set of nodes that provide a semantic interpretation of data and define local linear models for prediction purposes. Our method uses a Markov Jump particle filter (MJPF) for state estimation and abnormality detection. The proposed method can be used for selecting the optimal set features to be shared in networking operations such that state prediction, decision-making, and abnormality detection processes are favored. This work is evaluated by using a real dataset consisting of a moving vehicle performing some tasks in a controlled environment.",

      "abstract": "The proliferation of interconnected objects in the Internet of Things (IoT) can be benefit from integration of cognitive radio (CR) technologies at the network level. IoT networks equipped with cognitive capabilities can help to effectively alleviate the problem of spectrum scarcity. However, the IoT network can suffer from jammer attacks that interfere with user transmissions and disrupt communications. In this paper, we consider a CR-IoT network based on Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) modulation scheme and a reactive jammer is hypothesized to be present in the network. A jammer detection method is proposed that is based on learning a switching Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) from normal OFDM data transmissions that is capable to detect abnormal situations. The proposed model is shown to be capable to detect and locate multiple jammers. The comparison with a conventional energy detection shows the validity of the proposed approach.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive radio (CR) integrates results from software-defined radio (SDR), machine learning (ML), and neuroscience for smart radio transmission devices. SDR enables devices to be digitally and dynamically configured in online applications; methodologies and techniques developed to introduce self-awareness in existing systems can be based on ML. Specifically, CR can adaptively regulate its internal parameters in response to the changes in the surrounding environment. New physical layer security issues are also emerging, for example, smart jamming attacks aim to reduce the quality of service or to disrupt legitimate communications. In this context, the electromagnetic spectrum represents the environment, while signals inside it are the individual entities. A CR-to-spectrum interaction consists of a dynamic process that can be driven by a CR device. Learning dynamic and measurement models from spectrum data is the main objective in CR applications. To learn a model, statistical signal processing techniques can be used. Such models can be considered as parametric Bayesian filters that allow a CR to estimate current state of observed entities (including CR itself) and to predict their actions in the near future. Adaptive hierarchical Bayesian filters able to cover nonstationary entity behaviors can be described through probabilistic graphical models (PGM). Interacting entities can be modelled by coupling multiple PGMs related to different entities. In this chapter, state-of-the-art on representation and learning of dynamic models for physical layer security is introduced along with some future directions. An experimental framework is then presented with two currently investigated applications: Spectrum Intelligence and TV White Spaces (TVWS).",

      "abstract": "In this chapter, dynamic wideband signals with high sampling rate are analysed through the discrete Stockwell transform (ST). To this end, a reduced complexity ST-based transform with independent time and frequency resolution is investigated. We call it dual-resolution approach. It results in a new strategy based on a trade-off between the time–frequency resolution and the ST computational time addressing the problem of large amount of samples in wideband signals. Short-time Fourier transform (STFT) representation is also included to discuss the applicability to feature-based methodologies in a Cognitive Radio context. Real modulated signals are generated by a Software-Defined Radio testbed to validate the dual-resolution technique. Just 11–20% of the time necessary to generate the T matrix without dual-resolution is requested and 3–12% of the ST computational time with respect to the conventional ST. While, the number of samples can be till four times larger.",

      "abstract": "In this chapter, we investigate the extent to which the real-time bidirectional exchange of activity information can influence context-awareness, social presence, social connectedness, and importantly interpersonal activity synchrony in mediated ambient assisted living (AAL) environments. Additionally, we describe the design, development, and assessment of a bidirectional ambient display platform to support real-time activity awareness and social connectedness in mediated AAL contexts. In a semi-controlled study, we evaluate a conglomerate of activity-based lighting displays, to determine the effects of real-time bidirectional deployment on behaviour and social connectedness. Exploiting everyday objects, human activity levels are projected with a Philips Hue lamp, LED wallet, and LED walking cane, which render this information based on predefined patterns of light. Results from the current study show tendencies toward (1) an increase in implicit social interactions (e.g., the sense of experienced social presence and connectedness), (2) more positive social behaviours between the elderly and their caregivers in mediated AAL contexts, and (3) sporadic moments of interpersonal activity synchrony however, further investigation is necessary to determine the extent of this variable in mediated AAL contexts.",

Methods intended for identifying emotions in individuals are mainly based on facial and body expressions, or even physiological measurements which are not suited for crowded environments as the available information in crowds is usually limited to that provided by surveillance cameras where the face and body of pedestrians can often suffer from occlusion. This work proposes an approach for analysing walking behaviour and exploiting the interplay of motivations and expectations in the emotions of pedestrians. Real-world data is used to test the prediction of motivations and annotations on the emotional state of pedestrians are added to evaluate the proposed method's capability to estimate emotional states.

      "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach for learning self-awareness models for autonomous vehicles. Proposed technique is based on the availability of synchronized multi-sensor dynamic data related to different maneuvering tasks performed by a human operator. It is shown that different machine learning approaches can be used to first learn single modality models using coupled Dynamic Bayesian Networks; such models are then correlated at event level to discover contextual multimodal concepts. In the presented case, visual perception and localization are used as modalities. Cross-correlations among modalities in time is discovered from data and are described as probabilistic links connecting shared and private multi-modal DBNs at the event (discrete) level. Results are presented on experiments performed on an autonomous vehicle, highlighting potentiality of the proposed approach to allow anomaly detection and autonomous decision making based on learned self-awareness models.",

      "abstract": "In recent years several architectures have been proposed to learn embodied agents complex self-awareness models. In this paper, dynamic incremental self-awareness (SA) models are proposed that allow experiences done by an agent to be modeled in a hierarchical fashion, starting from more simple situations to more structured ones. Each situation is learned from subsets of private agent perception data as a model capable to predict normal behaviors and detect abnormalities. Hierarchical SA models have been already proposed using low dimensional sensorial inputs. In this work, a hierarchical model is introduced by means of a cross-modal Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) processing high dimensional visual data. Different levels of the GANs are detected in a self-supervised manner using GANs discriminators decision boundaries. Real experiments on semi-autonomous ground vehicles are presented.",

      "abstract": "This paper focuses on modeling and classifying trajectories from video sequences. Location, velocity and time of appearance are considered as features for recognizing and modeling motions of objects. In a training phase, a discretization of the proposed features is performed by using a self-organizing map approach such that a set of clusters (feature vocabulary) is created for describing trajectories. A cluster dissimilarity measure based on a weighted fusion of features facilitates the recognition of trajectory classes in an incremental way. As a result, an unsupervised method for encoding observed motion information and identifying trajectory patterns is proposed in this article. The method is evaluated with real and simulated data. Additionally' comparisons with previous works show the benefits of our method when encoding and identifying motion patterns in video sequences.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents, a system capable of detecting unusual activities in crowds from real-world data captured from multiple sensors. The detection is achieved by classifying the distinct movements of people in crowds, and those patterns can be different and can be classified as normal and abnormal activities. Statistical features are extracted from the dataset collected by applying sliding time window operations. A model for classifying movements is trained by using Random Forest technique. The system was tested by using two datasets collected from mobile phones during social events gathering. Results show that mobile data can be used to detect anomalies in crowds as an alternative to video sensors with significant performances. Our approach is the first to detect any unusual behaviour in crowd with non-visual data, which is simple to train and easy to deploy. We also present our dataset for public research as there is no such dataset available to perform experiments on crowds for detecting unusual behaviours.",

In an era of pervasive computing (i.e. the proliferation of ever-present smart devices), governments, companies, and academic institutions are working together to develop and promote cutting-edge initiatives that sustain the quality of life and address the complexities and opportunities of an ageing world. In this chapter, we propose a user-centred approach within a multidisciplinary framework, which incorporates human-computer interaction, social science, signal processing, and pervasive computing, to inspire the design of a bidirectional context-aware system to support social connectedness between the elderly and their caregivers. Following a review of previous works on socio-technical awareness systems and human activity recognition models, we describe our user-driven methodological approach and demonstrate the value and potential benefits of bidirectional activity-based peripheral systems within ambient assisted living environments.

      "abstract": "Cognitive radio is a promising technology for frequency allocation to improve the spectrum utilization efficiency of licensed bands. However, in recent years, the attention of the researchers is focused on security issues that have to be faced by cognitive radio technology. One of the most important issues consists of radio frequency jamming attacks, where adversaries can use on-the-fly reconfigurability and learning capabilities of cognitive radios in order to devise and deploy advanced jamming tactics. Jamming attacks can noticeably affect the performance of wireless communication systems and can lead to significant overhead in terms of data re-transmission and increased power consumption. In this article, a novel compressed sensing-based jammer detection algorithm is proposed using cyclic spectral analysis and artificial neural networks for wideband cognitive radios. A wideband spectrum is considered that is composed of multiple narrowband signals. Narrowband signals can be legitimate or jamming signals. Compressed sensing is used to reduce the overhead of the analog-to-digital conversion and it allows one to estimate a wideband spectrum with sub-Nyquist rate sampling. After the signal has been estimated, the second-order statistics, namely, spectral correlation function, is computed to extract cyclic features of the wideband signal. Finally, a pre-trained artificial neural network is proposed to classify each narrowband signal as a legitimate or jamming signal. Performances of proposed algorithm are shown with Monte-Carlo simulations under different empirical setups.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a methodology that aims at the incremental representation of areas inside environments in terms of attractive forces. It is proposed a parametric representation of velocity fields ruling the dynamics of moving agents. It is assumed that attractive spots in the environment are responsible for modifying the motion of agents. A switching model is used to describe near and far velocity fields, which in turn are used to learn attractive characteristics of environments. The effect of such areas is considered radial over all the scene. Based on the estimation of attractive areas, a map that describes their effects in terms of their localizations, ranges of action, and intensities is derived in an online way. Information of static attractive areas is added dynamically into a set of filters that describes possible interactions between moving agents and an environment. The proposed approach is first evaluated on synthetic data; posteriorly, the method is applied on real trajectories coming from moving pedestrians in an indoor environment.",

      "abstract": "The introduction of cognitive radio enables dynamic spectrum access for higher spectrum utilization, due to its ability of awareness of their environment. However, the introduction of cognitive radio technology brings new challenges to wireless networks security. Due to intelligent nature of the attackers, many of the radio frequency jamming attacks can be stealthy by nature. The stealthy jamming attacks can significantly impact the performance of the wireless communication system and can lead to significant overhead in terms of retransmission and increment of power consumption. This paper presents a new physical layer approach for stealthy jammer detection in wide-band (WB) cognitive radio networks. The proposed algorithm consider a WB consists of multiple narrow-band sub-bands (SB), which can be occupied by licit or jamming signals. The cyclostationary spectral analysis is performed on this WB signal to compute spectral correlation function (SCF). The alpha profile is extracted from the SCF and used as input features to artificial neural network (ANN), which classify each NB signal as a licit signal or a jamming signal. In the end, the performance of the proposed approach is shown with the help of Monte-Carlo simulations under different empirical setups.",

      "abstract": "To understand the behavior of moving entities in a given environment, one should be capable of predicting their motion, that is, to model their dynamics. In a setting where different behaviors can arise, one can assume that each of them corresponds to different motivational states of observed entities. Here, those motivations are understood as goal positions or spots where entities seek to arrive. To build prediction models based on that idea, we present an unsupervised method to estimate motivational spots actively. Additionally, we use the output of such process to refine an adaptive system modeling the dynamics of inferred hidden causes of observed data. The whole method uses deep variational methods, and particularly, the network estimating motivations is trained through dynamic programming. Results show that modeling the dynamics of entities can be better achieved by integrating information about motivational spots. Notably, a network modeling the dynamics converges faster through the incorporation of information about motivations.",

A formalism based on deep learning implementations of variational methods and Bayesian filtering theory is presented. It is explained how the proposed method is capable of modeling the environment to mimic behaviors in an observed interaction by building internal representations and discovering temporal and causal relations. The method is evaluated in a typical surveillance scenario, i.e., perimeter monitoring. It is shown that the vehicle learns how to drive itself by simultaneously observing its surroundings and the actions taken by a human driver for a given task. That is achieved by embedding knowledge regarding perception-action couplings in dynamic representational states used to produce action flows. Thereby, representations link sensory data to control signals. In particular, the representational states associate visual features to stable action concepts such as turning or going straight.",

      "abstract": "In this work, the problems of knowledge acquisition and information processing are explored in relation to the definitions of concepts and conceptual processing, and their implications for artificial agents. The discussion focuses on views of cognition as a dynamic property in which the world is actively represented in grounded mental states which only have meaning in the action context. Reasoning is understood as an emerging property consequence of actions-environment couplings achieved through experience, and concepts as situated and dynamic phenomena enabling behaviours. Re-framing the characteristics of concepts is considered crucial to overcoming settled beliefs and reinterpreting new understandings in artificial systems. The first part presents a review of concepts from cognitive sciences. Support is found for views on grounded and embodied cognition, describing concepts as dynamic, flexible, context-dependent, and distributedly coded. That is argued to contrast with many technical implementations assuming concepts as categories, whilst explains limitations when grounding amodal symbols, or in unifying learning, perception and reasoning. The characteristics of concepts are linked to methods of active inference, self-organization, and deep learning to address challenges posed and to reinterpret emerging techniques. In a second part, an architecture based on deep generative models is presented to illustrate arguments elaborated. It is evaluated in a navigation task, showing that sufficient representations are created regarding situated behaviours with no semantics imposed on data. Moreover, adequate behaviours are achieved through a dynamic integration of perception and action in a single representational domain and process.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive radio (CR) is an enabling technology for future wireless spectrum allocation to improve the use of licensed spectrum by enabling unlicensed users equipped with CRs to coexist with incumbent users in licensed spectrum bands while causing no interference to incumbent communication. However, security challenges faced by CR technology are still a research topic. One of the prevailing challenges, is the radio frequency jamming attack, where adversaries are able to exploit on-the-fly reconfigurability potentials and learning mechanism of cognitive radios in order to devise and deploy advanced jamming tactics. These attacks can significantly impact the performance of wireless communication systems and lead to significant overheads in terms of retransmission and increment of power consumption. In this work, a new jammer detection algorithm is proposed for wide-band (WB) radios. The proposed approach assumes a WB spectrum occupied by various narrow-band (NB) signals, which can be either legitimate or jamming signals. First, the received WB signal is recovered from sub-Nyquist rate samples using compressed sensing. Compressed sensing is used to alleviate Nyquist rate sampling requirements at the receiver A/D converter. After the Nyquist rate signal has been recoverd, a cyclostationary spectral analysis is performed on this estimated WB signal to compute spectral correlation function (SCF). The alpha profile is then extracted from SCF and used to classify each NB signal as a licit signal or illicit signal. In the end, the performance of the algorithm is shown with the help of Monte-Carlo simulations under different empirical setups.",

Since our GANs are trained with only normal data, they are not able to generate abnormal events. At testing time the real data are compared with both the appearance and the motion representations reconstructed by our GANs and abnormal areas are detected by computing local differences.

      "abstract": "In this work, we present a method for building grounded representations by structuring the sensorimotor data of an agent. The aim is to encode sensory inputs into internal states that describe action-environment couplings, or relations that connect elements in a scene to action concepts. Thus, the environment is represented regarding the sensorimotor integrations required to interact with elements in it. Such representations are acquired for a particular task in which they serve to infer important states and generate control commands accordingly. Representations are learned in an unsupervised process and are assembled into probability distributions to capture uncertainty. That is achieved through variational methods using deep learning and dynamic programming, and an architecture partially inspired by active inference. During an interaction, future representational states and sensorimotor data are actively predicted, while the incoming sensory information is incorporated through prediction error. Results in a navigation task show that situated representations emerge as sensorimotor relations that are interpretable as action concepts, and which allow interpreting important elements in the environment to generate satisfactory actions. We argue that the acquisition of such capabilities relates to the prediction processes enabled by two mechanisms; first, state-transition models explicitly dependent on the generation of control commands, and secondly, a system trained through dynamic programming, which generates further predictions that relate sensory data to expected state changes.",

In this work we propose a graph-based representation of hands seen from the point of view of the user, obtained through the shape-fitting capability of a modified Instantaneous Topological Map. Spectral analysis of the graph Laplacian allows to arrange eigenvalues in vectors of features, which prove to be discriminative in classifying the considered hand poses.",

Unlike traditional sensor networks, video processing may generate significant delays that also vary from camera to camera. Moreover, the continuous and rapid change of the dynamics of the consensus variable (the target state) makes tracking even more challenging under these conditions. To address this problem, we propose a consensus approach that enables each camera to predict information of other cameras with respect to its own capturing time-stamp based on the received information. This prediction is key to compensate for asynchronous data exchanges.

A bidimensional neural gas network is implemented to learn the topology of the physical environment in an unsupervised fashion, then a self-organizing map and a Bayesian network are used to describe the behavior of the crowd as a single entity. Experiments were conducted using footage from New York Grand Central Station to test the accuracy of our model to learn and identify different behaviors of the crowd.

      "abstract": "Approximately, one-third to half of all food produced globally is wasted. In developed countries, roughly up to half of this food waste comes from consumers. In response to this, the UN has set goals to raise consumer awareness and reduce food waste by 50% before 2030. Our objective is to evaluate how emerging technologies could improve awareness in households. Inspired by future sensing possibilities, we envision a community-based social system that captures in-home food availability and waste patterns and uses this information to support awareness and sustainability. In this work, we describe an evaluation of a component that could be part of such a system. This component or concept, called Social Recipes, aims at encouraging food sharing by suggesting groups of related consumers recipes that are based on ingredients from different individuals or households. To evaluate Social Recipes, we conducted 3 user studies to see how it could raise awareness and reduce food waste and to suggest implications for its design. In the first two studies, we evaluated expected impacts of the concept. The third study was a home deployment, where Social Recipes were sent using technological probes for a more realistic experience. Here, we also evaluated it against the more common method of influence strategy in sustainability research that is restricted to feedback (i.e., eco-feedback). Our main findings showed that Social Recipes has raised awareness of in-home food availability and triggered food-related conversations among participants resulting in knowledge gain. However, Social Recipes alone was not perceived as effective in directly reducing food waste. And therefore, for the design of a community-based social system, we suggest another component to be added to the system that provides eco-feedback. This component was perceived as more effective in reducing food waste with impacts on awareness of waste generation and social surveillance. Overall, the aim of this work is to contribute to an understanding of how Social Recipes could impact consumers and how to design a community-based social (recipe) system that can be integrated in consumers daily activities for effective but pleasurable food waste prevention.",

      "abstract": "Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) applications leverage pervasive sensing and ambient intelligence technologies to enable older people to live independently and to support their social inclusion and connectedness. Wearable sensors can be used to gather the elderly's activities of daily living (ADLs) data, thus enabling remote monitoring. Lately, ambient displays have been deployed to relay activity information in the periphery of the caregivers' attention in order to increase awareness of the activities of the elderly and to create a sense of connectedness. Moreover, there is accumulated evidence demonstrating the ability of ambient displays to influence and promote social connectedness between the elderly and their caregivers. In recent years, intelligent ambient lighting, a subclass of ambient displays, is emerging as an effective tool for conveying physical activity information. Existing literature suggests lighting encodings or configurations combining color, rate of change, position and brightness to communicate such information. Within AAL, there is little empirical evidence surrounding ambient lighting encodings that support this cause effectively. In this paper, we present an exploratory study investigating how potential caregivers perceive and interpret ambient lighting configurations for presenting activity information of the elderly. User preference, change noticeability and accuracy of the interpretation of three ambient lighting configurations were evaluated.",

      "abstract": "The emergence of ubiquitous sensing and the Internet of Things (IoT) have inspired the development of 'smart' everyday objects, which offer tremendous opportunities for maintaining the quality of life in ambient assisted living (AAL) environments. Inspired by the future possibilities of connected everyday devices, we envision a peripheral activity-based awareness system that captures human activity information and renders this information to enhance context awareness and support social connectedness between the elderly and their caregivers. Leveraging ambient intelligence and IoT technologies, ambient displays can convey activity information in the periphery of our attention. In particular, light has been used as a means to display ambient information and there is scientific evidence that it can enhance well-being, interconnectedness, and improve productivity. In this paper, we undertake two studies, first through an exploratory study we investigate the features of light suitable for conveying subtle activity information within the periphery of the users' attention for promoting context awareness. Also, we examine the preferences, perceptions, and interpretations of ambient lighting configurations of prospective caregiver's for conveying the activity information of older adults. In a second study, we assess the implications of activity awareness through lighting on cognitive performance, moods, and social connectedness. The set-up and design decisions of the second study were partly informed by previous research and by the outcomes of the first experiment. Together, these studies provide additional design guidelines for representing activity information with ambient lighting and highlight potential benefits and usage possibilities for lighting displays within the AAL domain. Furthermore, the results indicate a significant effect of activity awareness on cognitive performance. However, there were no significant effects of activity awareness through lighting on moods and social connectedness. Finally, we discuss the design guidelines and implications of these findings for designing activity-based ambient lighting displays for AAL environments.",

      "abstract": "New research on ambient displays within ambient assisted living (AAL) environments, demonstrates solid potential for the application of bidirectional activity-based context aware systems for promoting social connectedness between the elderly and their caregivers. Using visual, auditory or tactile modalities, such systems can reveal subtle information concerning health and well-being and stimulate co-presence between the pair. In this paper, we present the design and development of an activity-based framework aimed at enabling the real-time viewing of bidirectional activity states between the elderly and their caregivers. This framework seeks to overcome the limitations of existing ambient displays deployed in AAL settings, which are in most cases unidirectional and confined to the homes of its users. Our bidirectional activity-based framework, is based on an extensive literature review, expert advice and user feedback, which informed the design decisions about the product features and functionality. The system exploits a highly accurate activity recognition model to facilitate real-time activity awareness and an “always connected” service through portable interactive devices for stimulating social connectedness within the AAL domain.",

      "abstract": "Wearable cameras allow people to record their daily activities from a user-centered (First Person Vision) perspective. Due to their favorable location, wearable cameras frequently capture the hands of the user, and may thus represent a promising user-machine interaction tool for different applications. Existent First Person Vision methods handle hand segmentation as a background-foreground problem, ignoring two important facts: i) hands are not a single “skin-like” moving element, but a pair of interacting cooperative entities, ii) close hand interactions may lead to hand-to-hand occlusions and, as a consequence, create a single hand-like segment. These facts complicate a proper understanding of hand movements and interactions. Our approach extends traditional background-foreground strategies, by including a hand-identification step (left-right) based on a Maxwell distribution of angle and position. Hand-to-hand occlusions are addressed by exploiting temporal superpixels. The experimental results show that, in addition to a reliable left/right hand-segmentation, our approach considerably improves the traditional background-foreground hand-segmentation.",

      "abstract": "In this work, we propose a multi-camera object tracking method with surprisal observations based on the cubature information filter in visual sensor networks. In multi-camera object tracking approaches, multiple cameras observe an object and exchange the object’s local information with each other to compute the global state of the object. The information exchange among the cameras suffers from certain bandwidth and energy constraints. Thus, allowing only a desired number of cameras with the most informative observations to participate in the information exchange is an efficient way to meet the stringent requirements of bandwidth and energy. In this paper, the concept of surprisal is used to calculate the amount of information associated with the observations of each camera. Furthermore, a surprisal selection mechanism is proposed to facilitate the cameras to take independent decision on whether their observations are informative or not. If the observations are informative, the cameras calculate the local information vector and matrix based on the cubature information filter and transmit them to the fusion center. These cameras are called as surprisal cameras. The fusion center computes the global state of the object by fusing the local information from the surprisal cameras. Moreover, the proposed scheme also ensures that on average, only a desired number of cameras participate in the information exchange. The proposed method shows a significant improvement in tracking accuracy over the multi-camera object tracking with randomly selected or fixed cameras for the same number of average transmissions to the fusion center.",

These binary codes are very robust against noise and non-semantic changes in the image. These binary encoding can be embedded into the CNN as an extra layer at the end of the network. This results in real-time segmentation. To the best of our knowledge our method is the first attempt on general semantic image segmentation using CNN. All the previous papers were limited to few number of category of the images (e.g. PASCAL VOC).

      "abstract": "Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) aims to create innovative technical solutions and services to support independent living among older adults, improve their quality of life and reduce the costs associated with health and social care. AAL systems provide health monitoring through sensor based technologies to preserve health and functional ability and facilitate social support for the ageing population. Human activity recognition (HAR) is an enabler for the development of robust AAL solutions, especially in safety critical environments. Therefore, HAR models applied within this domain (e.g. for fall detection or for providing contextual information to caregivers) need to be accurate to assist in developing reliable support systems. In this paper, we evaluate three machine learning algorithms, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM), a hybrid of Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and SVM (SVM-HMM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) applied on a dataset collected between the elderly and their caregiver counterparts. Detected activities will later serve as inputs to a bidirectional activity awareness system for increasing social connectedness. Results show high classification performances for all three algorithms. Specifically, the SVM-HMM hybrid demonstrates the best classification performance. In addition to this, we make our dataset publicly available for use by the machine learning community.",

The proposed method is able to incrementally learn the velocity fields due to external static objects within the monitored environment. It determines whether an object has a repulsive or an attractive influence and provides an estimation of its position and size.

However, emotion estimation in crowds remains a challenging problem due to the complexity in which human emotions are manifested and the capability of a system to perceive them in such conditions. This paper proposes a hierarchical Bayesian model to learn in unsupervised manner the behavior of individuals and of the crowd as a single entity, and explore the relation between behavior and emotions to infer emotional states. Information about the motion patterns of individuals are described using a self-organizing map, and a hierarchical Bayesian network builds probabilistic models to identify behaviors and infer the emotional state of individuals and the crowd. This model is trained and tested using data produced from simulated scenarios that resemble real-life environments. The conducted experiments tested the efficiency of our method to learn, detect and associate behaviors with emotional states yielding accuracy levels of 74% for individuals and 81% for the crowd, similar in performance with existing methods for pedestrian behavior detection but with novel concepts regarding the analysis of crowds.",

      "abstract": "Under a tracking framework, the definition of the target state is the basic step for automatic understanding of dynamic scenes. More specifically, far object tracking raises challenges related to the potentially abrupt size changes of the targets as they approach the sensor. If not handled, size changes can introduce heavy issues in data association and position estimation. This is why adaptability and self-awareness of a tracking module are desirable features. The paradigm of cognitive dynamic systems (CDSs) can provide a framework under which a continuously learning cognitive module can be designed. In particular, CDS theory describes a basic vocabulary of components that can be used as the founding blocks of a module capable to learn behavioral rules from continuous active interactions with the environment. This quality is the fundamental to deal with dynamic situations. In this paper we propose a general CDS-based approach to tracking. We show that such a CDS-inspired design can lead to the self-adaptability of a Bayesian tracker in fusing heterogeneous object features, overcoming size change issues. The experimental results on infrared sequences show how the proposed framework is able to outperform other existing far object tracking methods.",

      "abstract": "A method for online incremental mining of activity patterns from the surveillance video stream is presented in this paper. The framework consists of a learning block in which Dirichlet process mixture model is employed for the incremental clustering of trajectories. Stochastic trajectory pattern models are formed using the Gaussian process regression of the corresponding flow functions. Moreover, a sequential Monte Carlo method based on Rao-Blackwellized particle filter is proposed for tracking and online classification as well as the detection of abnormality during the observation of an object. Experimental results on real surveillance video data are provided to show the performance of the proposed algorithm in different tasks of trajectory clustering, classification, and abnormality detection.",

      "abstract": "Throughout the 1990s, Software Defined Radio (SDR) technology was viewed almost exclusively as a solution for interoperability problems between various military standards, waveforms and devices. In the meantime, Cognitive Radio (CR) – a novel communication paradigm which embodies SDR with intelligence and self-reconfigurability properties – has emerged. Intelligence and on-the-fly self-reconfiguration abilities of CRs constitute an important next step in the Communications Electronic Warfare, as they may enable the jamming entities with the capabilities of devising and deploying advanced jamming tactics. Similarly, they may also aid the development of the advanced intelligent self-reconfigurable systems for jamming mitigation. This work outlines the development and implementation of the Spectrum Intelligence algorithm for Radio Frequency (RF) interference mitigation. The developed system is built upon the ideas of obtaining relevant spectrum-related data by using wideband energy detectors, performing narrowband waveform identification, extracting the waveforms’ parameters and properly classifying the waveforms. All relevant spectrum activities are continuously monitored and stored. Coupled with the self-reconfigurability of various transmission-related parameters, Spectrum Intelligence is the facilitator for the advanced interference mitigation strategies. The implementation is done on the Cognitive Radio test bed architecture which consists of two military Software Defined Radio terminals, each interconnected with the computationally powerful System-on-Module.",

      "abstract": "A new algorithm for jammer detection is proposed in this work for wide-band (WB) cognitive radio networks. First, the received WB signal, which is comprised of multiple narrow-band (NB) signals, is recovered from sub-Nyquist rate samples using compressed sensing. Compressed sensing allows us to alleviate Nyquist rate sampling requirements at the receiver A/D converter. After the Nyquist rate signal has been recovered, a cyclostationary feature detector is employed on this estimated signal to compute the cyclic features. Finally, the proposed algorithm uses the second order statistics, namely, the spectral correlation function (SCF), to classify each NB signal as a legitimate signal or a jamming signal. In the end, performance of the proposed algorithm is shown with the help of Monte-Carlo simulations under different empirical setups.",

      "abstract": "In large and crowded transportation sites such as ports, parking lots, or busy streets, the unsafe actions of a moving object (such as a pedestrian, a ship, or a car) may compromise the safety and security of the entire infrastructure. It follows that a full comprehension of the situations taking place in the area could significantly decrease the amount of work performed by human administrators and operators in charge of the zone, reducing also the impact of human errors. The idea behind this paper is to use trajectory data to analyze behaviors (atomic actions without any external influence) and interactions (actions inducted by the presence of another entity) of each target in the scene. Probabilistic techniques applied on a topological map of the scene allow tackling the problem in a robust way, handling the uncertainties arising in such environments. The system is tested in a real maritime scenario, where trajectory data of ships and vessels are used to determine normal and abnormal situations occurring in a canal.",

Due to their favourable location, they frequently capture the hands of the user, and may thus represent a promising user-machine interaction tool for different applications. Existent First Person Vision, methods understand the hands as a background/foreground segmentation problem that ignores two important issues: (i) Each pixel is sequentially classified creating a long processing queue, (ii) Hands are not a single “skin-like” moving element but a pair of interacting entities (left-right hand). This paper proposes a GPU-accelerated implementation of a left right-hand segmentation algorithm. The GPU implementation exploits the nature of the pixel-by-pixel classification strategy. The left-right identification is carried out by following a competitive likelihood test based the position and the angle of the segmented pixels.",

      "abstract": "Classifying frames, or parts of them, is a common way of carrying out detection tasks in computer vision. However, frame by frame classification suffers from sudden significant variations in image texture, colour and luminosity, resulting in noise in the extracted features and consequently in the decisions taken. Support Vector Machines have been widely validated as powerful tools for frame by frame detection of non-separable datasets, but are extremely sensitive to these variations between adjacent frames, creating as consequence sudden flickering in the classification results. This work proposes a Dynamic Bayesian Network to smooth the classification results of Support Vector Machines (SVM) in detection tasks. The method is evaluated in First Person Vision (FPV) videos, where a SVM is used to decide whether or not the user's hands are in his field of view.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes a new algorithm for jammer detection in wide-band (WB) cognitive radio networks. We consider a WB which comprises of multiple fixed length narrow-band sub-bands (SB). These SBs are occupied by narrow-band signals which can be legitimate users or a jammer. To reduce the overhead of the analog-to-digital conversion (ADC), compressed sensing (CS) is performed first. CS allows us to estimate a WB spectrum with sub-Nyquist rate sampling. After that, energy detection is applied to identify the occupied sub-bands (SB). Then, for each occupied SB, some waveform parameters such as signal bandwidth and power spectral density (PSD) levels are compared with licit user database to classify the observed signal as a licit user or a jammer. In the end, performance of the proposed algorithm is shown with the help of monte carlo simulations under different empirical setups.",

      "abstract": "Simulation of crowd behaviors is a widely discussed topic for over a decade for computer games, architecture and entertainment. The most important thing is that agents should execute the human like behaviors in real life scenarios. This situation becomes very complex with dense crowds. Our proposed Realistic Behavior Agent Simulation (RBAS) model simulates the agents from the knowledge of empirical findings of crowd physical behaviors and crowd psychology. This paper presents a novel technique to design the agents to with following modules 1) Path planning behavior for collision avoidance 2) Situation awareness during herding behavior and turbulent flow in high density crowds. 3) Personal Reaction bubble (PRB) based response and perceptions. The evaluation with real life situations is performed to validate the RBAS model. The RBAS model allows the agents to use cognitive understandings to plan ahead their path using the visual perception information. This model encapsulates the emergent crowd behaviors such as self-organization behavior in herding situation. During turbulent high density flows, most of the existing models fail to predict the behavior of agents, the evaluations show the RBAS model mimics the same behavior of the crowd in different situations.",

This paper introduces the evolution of methods for crowd emotion perception based on bio-inspired probabilistic models. The emotions have been perceived both in an offline and online manner from the crowd. We focus on the perception of emotion from crowd behavior and dynamics. The paper explains few probabilistic algorithms and compares these for detection of emotion of crowds and proposes a probabilistic modelling approach which is trained on data to perceive the emotions of the crowd in an area under surveillance. Emotions are defined as evolving dynamic patterns arising due to interaction of people in an environment with their relationships to the past interaction patterns. Camera sensors are used to track the motion of the individuals within a crowd scenario under observation. The data mining techniques are used to distinguish between different behaviors and events into positive and negative emotions. The results have been evaluated using simulated data from a proposed office environment.",

The main novelty consists in the study of the dynamic aspects of the moving objects by analysing the trajectories of the features followed in the HOG-PCA feature space, instead of the classical trajectory study based on the frame coordinates. The complete hybrid system was tested on the VIRAT database and worked in real time, yielding up to 100% peak accuracy rate in the tested video sequences.",

      "abstract": "The emergence of new wearable technologies, such as action cameras and smart glasses, has increased the interest of computer vision scientists in the first person perspective. Nowadays, this field is attracting attention and investments of companies aiming to develop commercial devices with first person vision (FPV) recording capabilities. Due to this interest, an increasing demand of methods to process these videos, possibly in real time, is expected. The current approaches present a particular combinations of different image features and quantitative methods to accomplish specific objectives like object detection, activity recognition, user-machine interaction, and so on. This paper summarizes the evolution of the state of the art in FPV video analysis between 1997 and 2014, highlighting, among others, the most commonly used features, methods, challenges, and opportunities within the field.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive algorithms, integrated in intelligent systems, represent an important innovation in designing interactive smart environments. More in details, Cognitive Systems have important applications in anomaly detection and management in advanced video surveillance. These algorithms mainly address the problem of modelling interactions and behaviours among the main entities in a scene. A bio-inspired structure is here proposed, which is able to encode and synthesize signals, not only for the description of single entities behaviours, but also for modelling cause–effect relationships between user actions and changes in environment configurations. Such models are stored within a memory (Autobiographical Memory) during a learning phase. Here the system operates an effective knowledge transfer from a human operator towards an automatic systems called Cognitive Surveillance Node (CSN), which is part of a complex cognitive JDL-based and bio-inspired architecture. After such a knowledge-transfer phase, learned representations can be used, at different levels, either to support human decisions, by detecting anomalous interaction models and thus compensating for human shortcomings, or, in an automatic decision scenario, to identify anomalous patterns and choose the best strategy to preserve stability of the entire system. Results are presented in a video surveillance scenario, where the CSN can observe two interacting entities consisting in a simulated crowd and a human operator. These can interact within a visual 3D simulator, where crowd behaviour is modelled by means of Social Forces. The way anomalies are detected and consequently handled is demonstrated, on synthetic and also on real video sequences, in both the user-support and automatic modes.",

Instead of applying the algorithm frame by frame, we propose a technique inspired to Bayesian filtering and to video coding which allows to re-initialize superpixels using the information from the previous frame. This results in faster convergence and demonstrates how performances improve with respect to the standard application of the algorithm from scratch at each frame.",

The framework combines the tracker with an on-line performance measure and a correction technique. We correlate model point trajectories to improve on-line the accuracy of a failed or an uncertain tracker. A model point tracker gets assistance from neighboring trackers whenever a degradation in its performance is detected using the on-line performance measure. The correction of the model point state is based on correlation information from the state of other trackers. Partial Least Square (PLS) regression is used to model the correlation of point tracker states from short windowed trajectories adaptively. Experimental results on data obtained from optical motion capture systems show the improvement in tracking performance of the proposed framework compared to the baseline tracker and other state-of-the-art trackers.",

In this paper we discuss the relevance and desirability of such a system and how it should be designed based on user studies. We identified the relevance of targeting ingredients and found positive expected experiences with the system such as to prevent habitual waste-related behavior, awareness of in-home food availability, creativity in cooking, moments for surprises and spontaneity, coordination among a group of friends, education and connectedness. Possible reasons of not using the system are trust and the inconvenience of distance among users in a group that are suggested with a social recipe. From our findings, we specify design implications for the system and optimization functions aiming at the prevention of food waste at a collective level.",

      "abstract": "Wideband spectrum sensing is a challenging task due to the constraints of digital signal processing (DSP) unit using in extant wireless systems. Compressive sensing (CS) is a new paradigm in signal processing, chosen for sparse wideband spectrum estimation with compressive measurements, thus provides relief of high-speed DSP requirements of cognitive radio (CR) receivers. In CS, whole wideband spectrum is estimated to find an opportunity for a CR usage requiring significant computation as well as sensing time, hence shrinkage the achievable throughput of CRs. In this paper, a novel model based CR receiver wideband sensing unit is addressed where a significant portion of the wideband spectrum is approximated through compressive sensing rather than recovering the total wideband spectrum. This model necessitates lesser sensing time and lower computational burden to detect a signal and as a result a level up of throughput is obtained. As a result, the sensing time gain improves the achievable throughput of the CRs which reflects on the simulation results and testifies the effectiveness of the proposed model. Therefore, a reduction of computational complexity is addressed without interfering with the detection performances, evaluated after spectrum estimation of a preferred band of interest by means of a well-known energy detector.",

      "abstract": "Hand detection and segmentation methods stand as two of the most most prominent objectives in First Person Vision. Their popularity is mainly explained by the importance of a reliable detection and location of the hands to develop human-machine interfaces for emergent wearable cameras. Current developments have been focused on hand segmentation problems, implicitly assuming that hands are always in the field of view of the user. Existing methods are commonly presented with new datasets. However, given their implicit assumption, none of them ensure a proper composition of frames with and without hands, as the hand-detection problem requires. This paper presents a new dataset for hand-detection, carefully designed to guarantee a good balance between positive and negative frames, as well as challenging conditions such as illumination changes, hand occlusions and realistic locations. Additionally, this paper extends a state-of-the-art method using a dynamic filter to improve its detection rate. The improved performance is proposed as a baseline to be used with the dataset.",

Sensing technologies can enable real-time monitoring to provide activity recognition in order to support health and safety among the elderly who are living independently. However, most existing activity recognition systems are focused on using sensors for unidirectional monitoring of emergency cases in particular, fall detection. Motivated by the desire to utilize bidirectional activity recognition to improve connectedness between an ageing population and their caregivers, we describe our planned approach to investigate how the perception of a caregiver's activities by a senior citizen and vice versa can aid in improving social connectedness. To investigate this perception, activity states will be transformed into an information visualization into the caregiver's home and vice versa without overt communication from participants. Findings are expected to provide further insight on the extent to which perception of human activities increase social connectedness.",

Nevertheless, the understanding of the environment surrounding the wearer is a difficult task with many elements involved.

Features extracted at the crowd level are used for building a robust representation that can handle the variations and occlusion of people’s visual characteristics inside a crowd. To this aim, convolutional neural networks have been exploited.

The dimensional reduction of the state space is pursued with Topology Representing Networks (TRNs), yielding the partitioning of the port area in zones of different size and shape. In the training phase, the zone changes of interacting moving vessels trigger different events, the occurrence of which is stored in Event-based DBNs. The interactions are modeled as deviation from the common behavior prescribed by a single-ship normality model, in order to reduce the number of conditional probabilities to calculate and store in the DBNs. Inference on the networks is then carried on to analyze the behavior of various ships and vessels maneuvering in the harbor. The results of the algorithm are showed by using simulated data relative to a real port.",

      "abstract": "In the sprouting paradigm of interoperable radio networks, wideband spectrum sensing is a challenging task for analog-to-digital converters (ADC) incorporated at the prevailing wireless radio systems because of the necessities of high sampling rates functioning at or above Nyquist frequencies. In order to cope with current ADCs, compressive sampling (CS), a promising scheme in signal processing arena, can be employed to search for the spectrum holes in the sparse wideband signals which are then opportunistically used by the cognitive radios (CR). In CS, transform coding as well as measurement matrix selection is an essential tool and it plays a vital role in the acquisition of wideband signals which comes out with a few number of random measurements. In this paper, two types of transform coding (Discrete Cosine Transform, DCT and Discrete Walsh-Hadamard Transform, WHT) is analyzed in the context of sparse wideband estimation via a well-known CS approach e.g., l<inf>1</inf>-norm optimization problem which could be used for spectrum sensing in wideband CR. Through the engagement of those measurement matrices, detection performance, execution time to sense PU bands and achievable capacity are investigated and analyzed at a single CR node. Finally, WHT coded CS scheme has been proposed for the wideband CR spectrum sensing as the simulation results arrange for the validation of our choice.",

      "abstract": "Several non-linear state estimation methods such as extended Kalman filter, cubature Kalman filter, and unscented Kalman filter are used to track objects in visual sensor networks. These conventional non-linear state estimation methods require the accurate knowledge of the object's initial conditions, process and measurement models, and corresponding noise characteristics. Often, the object trackers used in a visual sensor networks may not be provided with this knowledge. In this work, we propose a square root cubature H- information Kalman filter (SCHIF) based distributed object tracking algorithm. The H- method requires neither the exact knowledge of noise characteristic nor accurate process model. The information filters can be used without the knowledge of accurate initial conditions and it also makes the measurement update step computationally less complex in the distributed process. Finally, the square root version makes the filter numerically stable. Furthermore, the cameras in the network exchange their local estimates with other cameras. In the last step, the cameras fuse the received local estimates to obtain a global estimate of the object. Hence, the proposed method constitutes a more robust and efficient solution for the targeted application compared to the traditional methods.",

      "abstract": "Motion and depth perceptions allow, to the human visual system, of interpreting the object movements by surrounding environmental information processing. The cognitive science applied to computer vision field can be considered an important innovation in order to increase the detection and tracking performances. These tasks play a fundamental role for detecting and tracking of dim moving point targets in Infra-Red (IR) images, which are characterized by low levels of SNR. In such cases, by means of the paradigm of Track-Before-Detect (TBD) based detection algorithm, it is possible to distinguish the target from image background. This paper presents an innovative TBD based approach relies on interacting multiple target models, which is called Fusion Filters (FFs), for far objects in IR sequences. Specifically, through two different Kalman filters it is possible to estimate separately position and dimension of the target. By means of switching probabilistic models, the proposed framework infers on the different target motion percepts. Such a process permits to obtain the global state of the object by merging position with size estimates. The experimental results on real and simulated sequences demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

Key point in competitive learning is the definition of a suitable distance function, which we analyse in depth in this work.

      "abstract": "Hand detection is one of the most explored areas in Egocentric Vision Video Analysis for wearable devices. Current methods are focused on pixel-by-pixel hand segmentation, with the implicit assumption of hand presence in almost all activities. However, this assumption is false in many applications for wearable cameras. Ignoring this fact could affect the whole performance of the device since hand measurements are usually the starting point for higher level inference, or could lead to inefficient use of computational resources and battery power. In this paper we propose a two-level sequential classifier, in which the first level, a hand-detector, deals with the possible presence of hands from a global perspective, and the second level, a hand-segmentator, delineates the hand regions at pixel level in the cases indicated by the first block. The performance of the sequential classifier is stated in probabilistic notation as a combination of both, classifiers allowing to test new hand-detectors independently of the type of segmentation and the dataset used in the training stage. Experimental results show a considerable improvement in the detection of true negatives, without compromising the performance of the true positives.",

A bio-inspired model for representation of emotional patterns in crowds has been demonstrated. Emotions have been defined as evolving patterns as part of a dynamic pattern of events. This model has been developed to detect emotions of a crowd based on the knowledge from a learned context, psychology and experience of people in crowd management. The emotions of multiple people making a crowd in any surveillance environment are estimated by sensors signals such as a camera and are being tracked and their behavior is modeled using bio-inspired dynamic model. The behavior changes correspond to changes in emotions. The proposed algorithm involves the probabilistic signal processing modelling techniques for analysis of different types of behavior, interaction detection and estimation of emotions. The emotions are recognized by the expectation of temporal occurrences of causal events modeled by Gaussian mixture model. The model has been evaluated using the simulated behavioral model of a crowd.",

      "abstract": "This work presents a study of detection performance of energy detector in relay-based multihop cooperative diversity networks operating over independent Rayleigh fading channels. In particular, upper bound average detection probability expressions are obtained for three scenarios: (i) multihop cooperative relay communication; (ii) multi-hop cooperative relay communication with direct link and maximum ratio combiner (MRC) at destination; and (iii) multi-hop cooperative relay communication with direct link and selection combiner (SC) at destination. Classical method of performance evaluation based on probability density function (PDF) of received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is used. Furthermore, an alternative series form representation of generalized Marcum-Q function is employed in order to simplify the ensuing mathematical derivations. Because the obtained detection probability expressions are in the form of infinite summation series, their respective truncation error bounds are also derived. In the end, analyses are validated with the help of simulations and several observations regarding the impact of different parameters on detector's performance are outlined. © 2014 M. O.

      "abstract": "Detection of dim moving point targets in cluttered background can have a great impact on the tracking performances. This may become a crucial problem, especially in low-SNR environments, where target characteristics are highly susceptible to corruption. In this paper, an extended target model, namely Interacting Multiple Model (IMM), applied to Track-Before-Detect (TBD) based detection algorithm, for far objects, in infrared (IR) sequences is presented. The approach can automatically adapts the kinematic parameter estimations, such as position and velocity, in accordance with the predictions as dimensions of the target change. A sub-par sensor can cause tracking problems. In particular, for a single object, noisy observations (i.e. fragmented measures) could be associated to different tracks. In order to avoid this problem, presented framework introduces a cooperative mechanism between Joint Probabilistic Data Association Filter (JPDAF) and IMM. The experimental results on real and simulated sequences demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

      "abstract": "Detecting emotions of a crowd to control the situation is an area of emerging interest. The purpose of this paper is to present a novel idea to detect the emotions of the crowd. Emotions are defined as evolving quantities arising from the reaction to contextual situations in a set of dynamic pattern of events. These events depend on internal and external interaction states in an already mapped space. The emotions of multiple people constituting a crowd in any surveillance environment are estimated by their social and collective behaviors using sensor signals e.g., a camera, which captures and tracks their motion. The feature space is constructed based on local features to model the contextual situations and the different interactions corresponding to different emergent behaviors are modeled using bio-inspired dynamic model. The changes in emotions correspond to behavioral changes which are produced to regulate behaviors under different encountered situations. Proposed algorithm involves the probabilistic signal processing modelling techniques for analysis of different types of collective behaviors based on interactions among people and classification models to estimate emotions as positive or negative. The evaluations are performed on simulated data show the proposed algorithm effectively recognizes the emotions of the crowd under specific situations. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive radio (CR) promises to be a solution for the spectrum underutilization problems. However, security issues pertaining to cognitive radio technology are still an understudied topic. One of the prevailing such issues are intelligent radio frequency (RF) jamming attacks, where adversaries are able to exploit on-the-fly reconfigurability potentials and learning mechanisms of cognitive radios in order to devise and deploy advanced jamming tactics. In this paper, we use a game-theoretical approach to analyze jamming/anti-jamming behavior between cognitive radio systems. A non-zero-sum game with incomplete information on an opponent’s strategy and payoff is modelled as an extension of Markov decision process (MDP). Learning algorithms based on adaptive payoff play and fictitious play are considered. A combination of frequency hopping and power alteration is deployed as an anti-jamming scheme. A real-life software-defined radio (SDR) platform is used in order to perform measurements useful for quantifying the jamming impacts, as well as to infer relevant hardware-related properties. Results of these measurements are then used as parameters for the modelled jamming/anti-jamming game and are compared to the Nash equilibrium of the game. Simulation results indicate, among other, the benefit provided to the jammer when it is employed with the spectrum sensing algorithm in proactive frequency hopping and power alteration schemes.",

Recently, there is a lot of work being done to analyze the energy detectors in both diversity and cooperative relay networks. In this work, detection performance of energy detector is analyzed in a fixed-gain cooperative relay network with maximum-ratio combiner (MRC) at the destination. Upper and lower bounds on instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the relay path are used in this work to mathematically tract the analyses. Probability density function (PDF) is derived for these asymptotic instantaneous SNR bounds to obtain upper and lower bound expressions of average detection probability (P<inf>d</inf>) for the relay path transmission. Similarly, PDF is derived for the combined signal from direct and relay path at destination with MRC, which is then used to derive asymptotic bounds on average P<inf>d</inf> of the cooperative system. The derived upper and lower bounds are tight approximations of the exact average P<inf>d</inf> which is also validated through simulations. © 2014 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive Radio as a technological breakthrough and enabler for concepts such as Opportunistic Spectrum Access and Dynamic Spectrum Access has so far received significant attention from the research community from a theoretical standpoint. In this work, we build upon the theoretical foundation and present an implementation of a Software Defined Radio/Cognitive Radio platform, with the feature under particular interest being the so-called Smart Transmission Layer. Smart Transmission Layer is a feature developed within the currently ongoing nSHIELD project, whose goal is establishing new paradigms for Security, Privacy and Dependability (SPD) of the future embedded systems. The role of the SPD-driven Smart Transmission Layer is providing reliable and efficient communications in critical channel conditions by using adaptive and flexible algorithms for dynamically configuring and adapting various transmission-related parameters. The implementation was done on the test bed consisting of two Secure Wideband Multi-role - Single-Channel Handheld Radios (SWAVE HH) coupled with the powerful proprietary multi-processor embedded platforms, and the corresponding auxiliaries. Several case studies were performed, namely: remote control of the radios, analysis of the installed waveforms, interference detection, and spectrum sensing using a quasi-real-time energy detector. A roadmap towards the future implementation aspects using the test bed was set.",

      "abstract": "Extraction and representation of relevant information from large-scale surveillance systems constitute fundamental processes for allowing automatic interpretation of complex scenes. In particular, when the amount of information increases (i.e., due to a larger number of monitored areas), attention focusing techniques are needed to highlight most relevant parts within the overall acquired data. When wide area surveillance systems are considered, one of the major problems in event detections is the reconstruction of the scene as a whole, from spatially limited observations. In this paper, a novel representation technique for sparse information, based on information theory, is presented. Self Organizing Maps (SOMs) have been used for classifying and correlating observed sparse data time series. By means of Information Bottleneck theory, it is possible to determine the optimal data representation in the SOM-space as a tradeoff between the signal reconstruction capabilities and the original data statistical similarities preservation. Proposed experiments show how the so called information bottleneck-based SOM selection for knowledge modelling, can be applied to the field of crowd monitoring for people density map estimation and event detection.

      "abstract": "Recently, a Bayesian estimator with a hybrid update was developed [1], based on a mathematical formulation of sampling. Such an Event Based State Estimator (EBSE) allows for a stable synchronous state estimate, relying on asynchronous measurements. Usefulness of such a filter comes with its approximate analytic formulation, which is attainable given a send-on-delta sampling strategy. We argue that such a formulation can be extended to cope with a failing detector in case the filter is used for tracking. The basic idea is to approach the issue as a package loss problem, where a missed target is assimilated to a lost package. More in detail, we propose that this approach can be exploited in video tracking, where faulty detectors are commonplace. We show how tracking performance with a poor pedestrian detector, failing to recognize its target, can improve with respect to standard Kalman filter. © 2014 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The emergence of new pervasive wearable technologies (e.g. action cameras and smart glasses) calls attention to the so called First Person Vision (FPV). In the future, more and more everyday-life videos will be shot from a first-person point of view, overturning the classical fixed-camera understanding of Vision, specializing the existing knowledge of moving cameras and bringing new challenges in the field of video processing. The trend in research is going to be oriented towards a new type of computer vision, centred on moving sensors and driven by the need for new applications for wearable devices. We identify hand tracking and gesture recognition as an essential topic in this field, motivated by the simple realization that we often look at our hand, even while performing the simplest tasks in everyday life. In addition, the next frontier in user interfaces are hands-free devices. In this work we argue that applications based on FPV may involve information fusion at various complexity and abstraction levels, ranging from pure image processing to inference over patterns. We address the lowest, by proposing a first investigation on hand detection from a first-person point of view sensor and some preliminary results obtained fusing colour and optic flow information. © 2013 ISIF ( Intl Society of Information Fusi.",

      "abstract": "In most recent Intelligent Video Surveillance systems, mechanisms to support human decisions are integrated in cognitive artificial processes. These algorithms mainly address the problem of extraction and modelling of relevant information from a sensor network. In crowd monitoring the main problem is to individuate specific events as for example different behaviours among interacting entities. A bio-inspired structure for modelling cause-effect relationships between events was lately proposed by the authors and applied to the field of automatic crowd monitoring. Such cause-effect relationships are modelled by means of coupled Event-based Dynamic Bayesian Networks and stored within an Autobiographical Memory during a learning phase, in order to supply appropriate knowledge to the automatic system in the on-line phase. However, the definition of causality relies on the selection of relevant events, which is performed by means of Self Organizing Maps and on a temporal scale defined by a newly introduced temporal parameter. Performances of the proposed multi-camera video surveillance system are studied on tuning such causality parameters. © 2013 IEEE.",

To support this spectrum sharing functionality, the cognitive users dynamically sense the radio frequency environment for being aware of the high-priority licensed users. Spectrum sensing becomes challenging in the wideband regime due to high sampling frequency functioning at or above Nyquist rates. Based on the sparseness of the wideband signal, the spectrum can be recovered with only few compressive measurements, thus employs relief of high-speed signal processing units. This paper proposes an efficient way for wideband cognitive receiver sensing unit that estimate the highly sparse segment of wideband through compressed sensing rather than entire wideband spectrum and then discover spectral opportunity for a cognitive user. The proposed model deals with the highly-sparse signal segment which provides better spectral estimation and hence improves the detection performance, demonstrated by the simulation.

      "abstract": "Radio spectrum is an expensive resource and only licensed users have the right to use it. In the emerging paradigm of interoperable radio networks, the unlicensed users are allowed to use the radio frequency that is unoccupied by the licensed users in temporal and spatial manner. To support this spectrum optimization functionality, the unlicensed users are required to sense the radio environment periodically for being aware of the high-priority licensed users. Wideband spectrum sensing is a challenging task for the present analog-to-digital converters used in wireless systems due to the constraints of digital signal processing unit. Exploiting on the sparseness of the wideband signal, the spectrum can be recovered with only few compressive measurements, consequently employs relief of high-speed signal processing units. This paper presents a novel wideband sensing approach where a significant portion of wideband spectrum is approximated via compressive sensing rather than entire wideband spectrum estimation, thus reducing computational complexity for the cognitive radios. Detection performances are evaluated through spectrum estimation of the desired frequency band by means of a well-known energy detection method. Finally, reduction of computational burden and memory spaces obligation are described compared to the conventional compressive sensing preceded over a single RF chain, without interfering with the detection performances. © 2013 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, performance of the energy detector is analyzed in blind cooperative relay networks operating over independent and identically distributed (IID) Rayleigh fading channels. First, utilizing the closed-form expression of the probability density function (PDF) of the dual-hop relay link along with an alternative series form representation of the generalized marcum-Q function, exact average detection probability expression is obtained for the dual-hop blind relay link. After that, a closed-form PDF expression is derived for the total received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the combined received signal, received via the relay path and direct path, at the destination, which is assumed to be equipped with selection combiner (SC) and energy detector. Finally, within the same analytical framework, as established for the analysis of the relay link, an exact average detection probability expression for the cooperative system is derived. Since the obtained expressions are in the form of infinite summation series, therefore, respective series truncation error bounds are also calculated, which can be used to compute the number of terms required to achieve a given figure of accuracy. In the end, analytical expressions are validated with the help of computer simulations. It is expected that these analysis will be helpful in quantifying the future communication networks such as cognitive radio networks. © 2013 IEEE.",

In most recent systems addressed by research, automatic support to human decisions based on object detection, tracking and situation assessment tools is integrated as a part of a complete cognitive artificial process. In such cases a CSS needs to represent complex situations that describe alternative possible real time interactions between the dynamic observed situation and operators' actions. To obtain such knowledge, particular types of Event based Dynamic Bayesian Networks E-DBNs are here proposed. In this paper it is shown how, by means of Run Length Encoding (RLE) of off line acquired information, the cognitive system is able to represent and anticipate possible operators' actions within the CSS. Results are shown by considering a crowd monitoring application in a critical infrastructure. A system is presented where a CSS embedding in a structured way RLE E-DBN knowledge can interact with an active visual simulator of crowd situations.

      "abstract": "Visual tracking represents a fundamental processing step for most of the video analytics for surveillance applications where the aim is to automatically understand the action performed by the objects present in the monitored scene [1-3]. The basic tracking task consists in following a target frame by frame, labeling it, and estimating its trajectory. Although this problem has been widely investigated in the last decades, a solution is still to be found that is valid in general situations without defining tight constraints and assumptions mainly related to the complexity of the guarded scene in terms of number of moving objects and overlapping percentage between objects themselves with environmental obstacles. Crowded scenes in public unconstrained assets such as roads, railway stations, and airports represent a challenging scenario where state-of-the-art tracking algorithms are unable to correctly track each detected target. Therefore, more effective approaches (in terms of target detection and trajectory evaluation precision, object identity preservation, improved robustness to highly cluttered environments) are necessary to correctly perform the tracking task in these scenarios under different environmental conditions (e.g., light changes and nonstatic background). Moreover, research is also focusing on the development of trackers [4] able to enrich available track by including other features such as scale, pose, and shape in the object description with the aim of accomplishing advanced scene interpretation tasks. Furthermore, observation from trackers at different resolution levels can be useful to increase system performances and have a better understanding of the monitored scene.",

      "abstract": "Online evaluation of tracking algorithms has received attentions in computer vision community to detect failures and apply correction methods for achieving better performances. In this paper, a novel online evaluation framework is proposed for a multitarget feature points based object tracking. An online partial least square regression and correlation model is constructed from short trajectory histories for the tracks. The model allows to estimate the state of one track from the other track states. The core idea for the method is creating a virtual reference data for evaluation from the learned model. The proposed self-evaluation mechanism is presented as a Dynamic Bayesian Network. The method is evaluated on a simulation data for tracking feature points from a pedestrian. © 2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) consists of small sensor devices with sensing, processing and communication capabilities. Sensor nodes are operated by batteries. As the replacement of these batteries are not practical, this network is very much energy sensitive. Resource coordination is an important issue to make this system energy efficient. Sensor nodes can be applied in various applications. Object tracking, routing, event detection are some common applications in WSN. These application needs to perform some tasks like sensing, transmitting, sleeping, receiving etc. At each time step, the sensor nodes need to perform one task based on its application demand. Scheduling of these tasks is very important aspect for WSN in order to coordinate the resources. In this paper, an effective market based method is proposed for resource coordination in WSN. At first the description of the problem is presented then the combinatorial auction based method is proposed. The simulation results show the efficiency of the proposed method comparing with other existing methods. © 2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Radio tactical scenarios are rapidly evolving and MANETs (Mobile Ad-hoc NETworks) are more and more frequently adopted because of their recognized advantages (absence of infrastructure, mobility management, traffic forwarding, etc.), also pushed by the rapid evolution of Software Defined Radio (SDR). The impact over network performances of fast and continuous topology changes due to nodes' mobility, together with other constrains (such as adverse e.m. propagation environment, available bandwidth, nodes' computational capacity and power consumption) is anyhow still one of the major issues to be faced in MANETs. Traditional routing protocols have been adapted in recent times to cope with the above mentioned constraints and in particular our attention was focused on the well-known and widely adopted Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol. This paper presents an improvement of the Quality of Service (QoS) features of the 'standard' OLSR protocol, in terms of packet loss and delay. The so-called 'Location Aware' OLSR protocol is based on the introduction of two concepts: the 'Perceived Coverage Radius' and 'Perceived Coverage Area'. In simple terms, the basic idea behind those concepts is to 'judiciously' exclude from the one-hop neighbor set of a node, those nodes which will presumably move out in a little time of the e.m. coverage area of the node. Benefits of the innovative method has been demonstrated and validated through simulations of typical tactical applications. © 2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The employment of sophisticated tools for data analysis in distributed or structurally complex systems requires the development of specific architectures and data fusion strategies in order to integrate heterogeneous information coming from the environmental sensors. Recently, intelligent sensor networks have been widely deployed for various purposes concerning both security- and safety-oriented systems. Military and civil applications ranging from border surveillance and public spaces monitoring to ambient intelligence and road safety are examples of such various applications. The architecture presented in this article is based on the Cognitive Node (CN) - a module able to receive data from the sensors, process it in order to find potentially harmful or anomalous events and situations and, in some cases, to interact with the environment itself or contact the human operator. The cognitive model was studied and exploited, focusing on the analysis and decision blocks which represent the crucial phases for assessing potentially unsecure/unsafe events and/or situations. The scalability of the model with regards to different application domains was investigated during the research activity. Proposed results show the capability of the given architecture for analysis and assessment of the occurring interactions, with the goal of maintaining proper security/safety levels in the monitored environment. © 2012 IEEE.",

Moreover, the challenges are analyzed that are associated with spectrum sensing and dynamic spectrum access techniques.

      "abstract": "Online evaluation of tracking algorithms is an important task in real time tracking systems to detect failures. In visual object tracking based on sparse features, detecting the failure of one of the feature points (corners) and correcting it will improve the performance of the tracker as a whole. In this paper a time reversed Markov chain is applied as evaluation technique to identify the failed trackers and Partial Least Square regression is used for learning the correlation between feature points from training data set. The detected feature point trackers are recovered from the knowledge of the learned correlation model. The results are explained on a Bayesian algorithm for rigid/nonrigid 2D visual object tracking.

      "abstract": "This paper describes a Bayesian algorithm for rigid/non-rigid 2D visual object tracking based on sparse image features. The algorithm is inspired by the way human visual cortex segments and tracks different moving objects within its FOV by constructing dynamical nonretinotopic layers. The method is explained as a recursive algorithm between time slices (intra-slice) and as a forward-backward message passing within every time slice (inter-slice) under the Probabilistic Graphical Model (PGM) framework. Finally, an observation model function that resembles the Generalized Hough Transform and allows exploiting internal structure of the problem is employed in order to increase the robustness and accuracy of the algorithm against clutter and missed detections. © 2011 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Advances in computer vision and pattern recognition research are leading to video surveillance systems with improved scene analysis capabilities. However, up to now few works have handled the problem of how the system, along with a human operator, can actively cope with detected anomalous events. In this paper, on the basis of recent studies on artificial cognitive systems, a general framework is proposed for designing interactive, adaptable and intelligent surveillance systems. The aim of the system is to react to situations in a preventive way using actuators installed in the monitored environment. An application of the proposed system is introduced where a guard is supported in pursuing an intruder. The operator is first localized and tracked and then multi-modal guidance messages are communicated to him on a mobile device. Previous experience on the interaction dynamics between the two players is provided by a simulator, modeling guard and intruder behaviors, to predict near future events and decide the appropriate messages to be sent. Results on real world video sequences show the reliability of the simulated data to build up interaction models and predict near future events. Moreover, the system capability of learning relationships with the operator to establish efficient and personalized communications is verified. © 2011 - IOS Press and the authors.

      "abstract": "Recently, the growing success of new wireless applications and services has led to overcrowded licensed bands, inducing the governmental regulatory agencies to consider more flexible strategies to improve the utilization of the radio spectrum. To this end, cognitive radio represents a promising technology since it allows to exploit the unused radio resources. In this context, the spectrum sensing task is one of the most challenging issues faced by a cognitive radio. It consists of an analysis of the radio environment to detect unused resources which can be exploited by cognitive radios. In this paper, three different cognitive radio architectures, namely, stand-alone single antenna, cooperative and multiple antennas, are proposed for spectrum sensing purposes. These architectures implement a relatively fast and reliable signal processing algorithm, based on a feature detection technique and support vector machines, for identifying the transmissions in a given environment. Such architectures are compared in terms of detection and classification performances for two transmission standards, IEEE 802.11a and IEEE 802.16e. A set of numerical simulations have been carried out in a challenging scenario, and the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed architectures are discussed. © 2011 Luca Bixio et al.",

      "abstract": "In the last few years, the decrease of hardware costs and the contemporary increase of processing capabilities make possible the development of more and more complex surveillance systems with hundreds of sensors deployed in large areas. New functionalities are now available such as scene understanding, context-dependent processing and real-time user-driven functionality selection. The efficient use of these tools in architecturally complex systems for advanced scene analysis needs the development of specific data fusion algorithms able to merge multi-source information provided by a large number of homogeneous or heterogeneous sensors. In this context, the possibility of distributing the intelligence is one of the more innovative and interesting research fields for such systems. Therefore, several studies are focused on how the logical tasks can be partitioned between smart sensors, intermediate processing nodes and control centers. Typical tasks of surveillance systems (context analysis, object detection, tracking...) are organized into hierarchical chains, where lower levels in the architectures provide input data for higher level tasks. Each element of the architecture is capable of autonomous data processing. The complexity of such systems remarks the importance of good design choices for both logical and physical architecture. The main objective of this book chapter is to present possible solutions to evaluate the overall performance and technical feasibility as well as the interactions of the subparts of distributed multi-sensor surveillance systems. Performance evaluation of a multi-level hierarchical architecture does not pertain only to the accuracy of involved algorithms but several other aspects must be considered as the data communication between smart sensors and higher level nodes, the computational complexity and the memory used. Then, in order to define a procedure to assess the performances of this kind of systems a general model of smart sensors, intermediate processing nodes and control centers has been studied taking into account the elements involved in a multi-sensor distributed surveillance tasks. The advantage of the proposed architecture analysis method are: 1) to allow quantitative comparison of different surveillance structures through the evaluation of performance metrics and 2) to validate the algorithm choice with respect to the physical structure (communication links, computational load...) available. Finally example structures are compared in order to find the best solution to some benchmark problems. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

For this purpose, a Bayesian tracking algorithm is coupled with a bio-inspired interaction analysis framework. The motion patterns of moving entities provided by the tracker are analyzed in order to recognize the current situation; causal relationships between interacting individuals in the environment are formulated in terms of probabilistic distributions that are used to cue the tracker in closed loop.

In this paper, we investigate the study and implementation of algorithms for the extraction of context data from on-board cameras mounted on vehicles. A camera is oriented so as to frame the portion of road in front of the vehicle while the other one is positioned inside the vehicle and pointed on the driver. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",

This motion descriptor is by design invariant to scale, camera motion and is not affected by non stationary background.

Evaluating a multi-objective fitness function in a discrete voting space, partial similarities between deformable objects can be found and a correct data association can be performed. A genomic encoding of corner-based shapes is introduced and, taking advantage of a robust genetic-based search algorithm, sets of corners pertaining to objects of interest are mapped into common models.

      "abstract": "In Smart Spaces (SSs), the capability of learning from experience is fundamental for autonomous adaptation to environmental changes and for proactive interaction with users. New research trends for reaching this goal are based on neurophysiological observations of human brain structure and functioning. A learning technique that is used to provide the SS with the so-called Autobiographical Memory is presented here by drawing inspiration from a bio-inspired model of the interactions occurring between the system and the user. Starting from the hypothesis that user's actions have a direct influence on the internal system state variables and vice versa, a statistical voting algorithm is proposed for inferring the cause/effect relationships among users and the system. The main contribution of this paper lies in proposing a general framework that is able to allow the SS to be aware of its present state as well as of the behavior of its users and to be able to predict the expected consequences of user actions. © 2006 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Visual tracking represents the basic processing step for most video analytics applications where the aim is to automatically understand the actions occurring in a monitored scene. Consequently, the performances of these applications are significantly dependent on the accuracy and robustness of the tracking algorithm. Bayesian state estimation and probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) have proved to be very powerful and appropriate mathematical tools to efficiently solve the inference problem of motion estimation by combining object dynamics and observations. In this article, the impact of these signal processing techniques on the development of recent tracking algorithms is shown and a categorization of the most common approaches is proposed. This categorization intends to logically organize different concepts related to Bayesian visual tracking to give a global overview to the reader. Finally, general considerations on the design of visual trackers for video analytics systems are discussed, focusing on the tradeoff that is usually performed between the accuracy of the target motion assumptions and the robustness of the object appearance representation. © 2010 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Real-time automatic human behavior recognition is one of the most challenging tasks for intelligent surveillance systems. Its importance lies in the possibility of robust detection of suspicious behaviors in order to prevent possible threats. The widespread integration of tracking algorithms into modern surveillance systems makes it possible to acquire descriptive motion patterns of different human activities. In this work, a statistical framework for human interaction recognition based on Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) is presented: the environment is partitioned by a topological algorithm into a set of zones that are used to define the state of the DBNs. Interactive and non-interactive behaviors are described in terms of sequences of significant motion events in the topological map of the environment. Finally, by means of an incremental classification measure, a scenario can be classified while it is currently evolving. In this way an autonomous surveillance system can detect and cope with potential threats in real-time. © 2010 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Automatic understanding of human behavior is an important and challenging objective in several surveillance applications. One of the main problems of this task consists in accurately defining models able to characterize in a discriminative but, at the same time, enough general way people actions. In this work a bio-inspired model is proposed to represent people interactions in a Bayesian framework using their patterns of movement. Couples of observed interacting trajectories are encoded into a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) model where states and conditional probability densities are learned in an online manner in order to statistically describe interactions. Observed trajectories are processed by the Instantaneous Topological Map (ITM) algorithm that automatically creates a topological map used to define the states of the DBN. The transition probabilities are estimated by combining states frequency of occurrence, evaluated by a voting-based approach, and their temporal occurrence represented by Gaussian Mixture Models. The discriminative capabilities of this model to detect interactions are shown both in a simulated and in a real-world environment. © 2009 IEEE.",

Moreover, the evolution of technologies at the disposal of criminal activities is leading to an increasing need for a technological basis and relevant knowledge to improve security capabilities. Especially, more work has to be done in defining a security architecture that takes into account cascading effects, inter and intra dependencies, distributes the intelligence in the infrastructure to increase its robustness, trustworthiness and resilience. According to this statement, an innovative situation awareness and assessment based approach for the monitoring of Critical Infrastructures is proposed. In particular, based on recent studies on artificial cognitive systems, we explore the concepts for designing interactive, adaptable and intelligent multi sensor surveillance systems able to react to situations in a preventive and manageable way. To reach this goal, in this paper we emphasize that innovative strategies could be based on the integration of heterogeneous sensing devices, such as distributed cognitive radio sensors for communication and monitoring and a network of smart cameras for the interpretation of interactions and events. © 2009 WIT Press.",

However, ADSA requires a higher level of reconfigurability with respect totraditional wireless systems. In this context, one of the technologies thatcan provide such flexibility is the promising cognitive radio (CR).In an ADSA scenario, CR should sense the spectrum to find the resources unused byprimary (licensed) users, which could then be exploited by secondary(unlicensed) CR users to increase the overall system efficiency.In this chapter, a comprehensive overview of CR applications to ADSA is carried out;in particular, attention is paid to the potentialities of autonomic bio-inspiredapproaches, and on their advantages in the solution of the challenges ofADSA systems. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a multitarget tracking algorithm based on a particle filter framework that exploits a sparse distributed shape model to handle partial occlusions. The state vector is composed by a set of points of interest (i.e. corners) and it enables to jointly describe position and shape of the target. An efficient importance sampling strategy is developed to limit the number of used particles and it is based on multiple Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi (KLT) feature trackers used to estimate local motion. The importance sampling strategy adaptively handles KLT failures and partial occlusions. Particles weights are computed exploiting a shape matching technique combined with object local appearance encoded in color histograms of patches centered on the points of interest constituting the state. The proposed approach does not require background subtraction techniques and overcomes several common difficulties in the tracking domain as partial occlusions, object deformations, scale changes, abrupt motion and non-static background. Extensive experimental results are provided on challenging sequences to demonstrate the robustness of the algorithm. ©2009 IEEE.",

The state vector is composed by a set of corners and it enables to jointly describe position and shape of the target. Mean Shift trackers, applied to color cues associated to state subspaces, are employed to predict the target global motion. An adaptive system noise is defined based on this information to cope with local deformations. The updating procedure is accomplished by a shape matching technique.

Evolutionary algorithms can be used for various tasks, such as connection weights training, structure design, learning rule adaptation, input feature selection, and rule extraction from neural networks. In this paper we study the effect of genetic operators crossover and mutation on the diversity of a population of evolvable neural networks. Diversity is an important aspect of evolvable neural networks. The lack of diversity leads to premature convergence problem and stagnation in local minima. The correlation between population diversity and fitness is also studied and the overall effect of diversity on the evolution of neural networks is investigated. Experimental results show that mutation operator has promoting effect on the diversity more than crossover and there is strong correlation between diversity generated by mutation operator and maximum fitness of population. But the change of maximum fitness associated with crossover operator is greater than one associated with mutation operator. © 2008 IADIS.",

By using this method, it will be shown that it is possible to improve the global correctness of the tracking and targets model estimation by fusing the information owned locally by each tracker in a collaborative way. The reported experimental results indicate good performances of the algorithm in crowded scenes.",

      "abstract": "A new collaborative tracking approach is introduced which takes advantage of classified features. The core of this tracker is a single tracker that is able to detect occlusions and classify features contributing in localizing the object. Features are classified in four classes: good, suspicious, malicious, and neutral. Good features are estimated to be parts of the object with a high degree of confidence. Suspicious ones have a lower, yet significantly high, degree of confidence to be a part of the object. Malicious features are estimated to be generated by clutter, while neutral features are characterized with not a sufficient level of uncertainty to be assigned to the tracked object. When there is no occlusion, the single tracker acts alone, and the feature classification module helps it to overcome distracters such as still objects or little clutter in the scene. When more than one desired moving objects bounding boxes are close enough, the collaborative tracker is activated and it exploits the advantages of the classified features to localize each object precisely as well as updating the objects shape models more precisely by assigning again the classified features to the objects. The experimental results show successful tracking compared with the collaborative tracker that does not use the classified features. Moreover, more precise updated object shape models will be shown.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a Bayesian framework for a new model-based learning method, which is able to track nonrigid objects in the presence of occlusions, based on a dynamic shape description in terms of a set of corners. Tracking is done by estimating the new position of the target in a multimodal voting space. However, occlusion events and clutter may affect the model learning, leading to a distraction in the estimation of the new position of the target as well as incorrect updating of the shape model. This method takes advantage of automatic decisions regarding how to learn the model in different environments, by estimating the possible presence of distracters and regulating corner updating on the basis of these estimations. Moreover, by introducing the corner feature vector classification, the method is able to continue learning the model dynamically, even in such situations. Experimental results show a successful tracking along with a more precise estimation of shape and motion during occlusion events.",

      "abstract": "One of the main issues for Ambient Intelligence (Ami) systems is to continuously localize the user and to detect his/her identity in order to provide dedicated services. A video-radio fusion methodology, relying on the Particle Filter algorithm, is here proposed to track objects in a complex extensive environment, exploiting the complementary benefits provided by both systems. Visual tracking commonly outperforms radio localization in terms of precision but it is inefficient because of occlusions and illumination changes. Instead, radio measurements, gathered by a user's radio device, are unambiguously associated to the respective target through the \"virtual\" identity (i.e. MAC/IP addresses). The joint usage of the two data typologies allows a more robust tracking and a major flexibility in the architectural setting up of the Ami system. The method has been extensively tested in a simulated and off-line framework and on real world data proving its effectiveness. © 2007 IEEE.",

A voting mechanism followed by a probability density analysis of the voting space histogram is used to estimate new position of the target. The model is updated at any frame. The problem rises in the occlusion events where the occluder corners affect the model and the tracker may follow the occluder. The key point of the method toward success is automatically deciding on the corners to classify them into two classes, good and malicious corners. Good corners are used to update the model in a conservative way removing the corners that are voting to the highly voted wrong positions due to the occluder. This leads to a continuous model learning during occlusion. Experimental results show a successful tracking along with a more precise estimation of shape and motion during occlusion events. © 2007 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Learning from experience is a basic task of human brain that is not yet fulfilled satisfactorily by computers. Therefore, in recent years to cope with this issue, bio-inspired approaches has gathered the attention of several researchers. In this work a learning method is proposed based on a model derived from neurophysiological observations of the generation of the sense of self which is connected to the memorization of the interaction with external entity. The domain of application where this algorithm is employed, is a Cognitive Surveillance system which aims at detecting intruders and communicate guidance messages to a user (a guard) provided with a mobile device in order to chase him. The proposed method intends to allow the system to establish an efficient interaction with the user by sending messages only when necessary. To this end the zones of the monitored area are classified according to the probability that a change in pursuit strategy will occur by learning online the motion of the user and the intruder. The proposed algorithm has been tested on real world data demonstrating the capacity of learning this information to be used to tag the zones of the area under exam. © 2007 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The Bayesian filtering for recursive state estimation and the shape-based matching methods are two of the most commonly used approaches for target tracking. The Multiple Hypothesis Shape-based Tracking (MHST) algorithm, proposed by the authors in a previous work, combines these two techniques using the Particle Filter algorithm. The state of the object is represented by a vector of the target corners (i.e. points in the image with high curvature) and the multiple state configurations (particles) are propagated in time with a weight associated to their probability. In this paper we demonstrate that, in the MHST, the likelihood probability used to update the weights is equivalent to the voting mechanism for Generalized Hough Transform (GHT)-based tracking. This statement gives an evident explanation about the suitability of a MAP (Maximum a Posteriori) estimate from the posterior probability obtained using MHST. The validity of the assertion is verified on real sequences showing the differences between the MAP and the MMSE estimate. © 2007 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "In the last years, the Particle Filter algorithm has been extensively proposed and employed for handling the problem of visual tracking of multiple moving objects under different assumptions. This wide usage is due to the capability of performing a recursive multiple hypothesis state estimation for non-linear non-Gaussian motion and observation models. In this paper a method, based on the Particle Filter framework, is proposed for multiple objects tracking, exploiting a target representation consisting of position and shape described as a fixed dimensionality vector composed by a fixed number of grouped target corners. However, usually, application domains of visual tracking algorithms are characterized by non-rigid objects and high occlusions rate entailing new corners to appear and others to disappear at each frame. In order to cope with this problem, a voting method (i.e. the Generalized Hough Transform) is employed to estimate the likelihood function to weight different propagated particles (i.e. multiple corners configurations describing shapes) by means of the corners extracted from the currently observed image. This method, in addition to the high dimensionality of the state representation, depicts the two main particularities of the presented Particle Filter. The proposed algorithm has been tested in a real-world domain and experiments indicate good results in tracking both rigid and non-rigid objects. © 2007 SPIE-IS&T.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a method based on skin color-model face detection and human body proportion constraints to estimate the number and position of people entering the monitored scene as a compact group. This helps to split the group into individual persons and solve a common lack in traditional background subtraction based detection and tracking methods: despite common systems, this algorithm can recognize the number and position of the people in a single change detection blob. The hypotheses are: standing subjects, face visibility from the point of view of the camera, a calibrated map to estimate objects' distance from the sensor and to estimate expected people's height on the image plane. These estimations allow dynamic thresholding of several shape parameters and lead to very interesting results. © 2006 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, an analysis of a new synchronization technique for Binary Offset Carrier (BOC) modulated signals will be presented. Goal of the proposed method is to improve the synchronization performances by reducing the synchronization errors due to the characteristic BOC cross-correlation function. The synchronization is generally based on the envelope of the cross-correlation between the received signal and the local replicas. In a classical NRZ modulation this envelope is approximately a triangle whose peak corresponds to the perfect synchronization between the incoming signal and local replicas. In the BOC case, instead, the cross-correlation is given by a set of triangles with positive and negative peaks in which only the central one corresponds to the perfect synchronization. This paper will describe a novel technique characterized by a different choice of the local replica. In this manner the cross-correlation envelope is composed by different triangles with positive and negative peaks; this envelope has one and only one zero-crossing that corresponds to the perfect synchronization. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, a theoretical analysis has been carried on together with computer simulations. In particular, the main properties of the technique, compared with the classical situation, will be presented.",

      "abstract": "The problem faced in this work is related to tracking and recognition of rigid and non-rigid interacting objects in complex scenes from a static camera. The processing steps leading to the description of the behavior of objects in terms of trajectories and typology will be illustrated in details and the performances of the system will be discussed. The proposed approach uses an empty reference image for object extraction through image difference; the reference frame is updated continuously by a high level background updating module taking into account the detected objects and their classification tag. The tracking module is responsible for objects labelling being able to preserve objects identity even when an occlusion occurs on the image plane between different objects. A novel approach is considered for tracking and recognition, which is based on different features selection strategies applied to an initially redundant set of shape points (i.e. corners). Short-term and long-term memory models are used in a cooperative scheme. The two level feature selection strategy used by long-term shape models is described: at lower level a spatial-temporal voting method is used to assess temporal stability of spatial groups of corners; at the higher level, a supervised self-organizing scheme is used for objects classification. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

      "abstract": "In this paper a novel method to solve the fine synchronization problem in GNSS receivers is presented, The GPS system modernization phase and the Galileo system development will increase signal availability and hence GNSS system-based applications. This variety of uses pervades almost every aspect of GNSS activity and provides the stimulus for its future improvement. For all these causes, in the past few years, there has been a growing interest in the research on the development of techniques and methods for improving the signal reception. Unfortunately, the receiver measurement is usually affected by errors. As already said, in an urban environment the major error source is given by muttipath fading. The proposed method is based on frequency diversity, i.e. the distortions introduced by the channel can be considered different and uncorrelated for sufficiently spaced frequencies. For this reason it is possible to design receivers that, through the usage of multiple frequencies, can improve the reception of SIS, minimizing the distortion effects of the multipath channel. In the proposed system two frequencies in E band, i.e. E5A and E5B, have been considered, and the derived information is fused by using a Neural Network (NN). The NN bases its adaptive fusion on parameters which represent the amount of noise in each of the considered frequencies. Considering the receiver from an higher level, it would be more accurate and efficient if it would be provided by an artificial intelligence that can be developed within the framework of Cognitive Radio devices, the future paradigm for mobile navigation and communication terminals.",

      "abstract": "Thanks to advances in a range of heterogeneous fields, from video analysis and understanding to software agents, from multi-sensor context assessment to pervasive communications, research on Ambient Intelligence systems is making significant progress towards the implementation of Smart Spaces (SS) where users are provided with an ensemble of ubiquitous virtual services [1][2][3][4]. ISTAG (Information Society Technology Advisory Group) gives a more formal definition of Ambient Intelligence (AmI) that points out how it should provide technologies to surround users with intelligent sensors and interfaces and to support human interactions [5]. While the specific services being provided can vary significantly according to the application domain, a common requirement for many AmI systems is that of supporting their users with guidance on available services, safety warnings and navigation aids. Providing effective assistance to users complex scenarios requires giving to the system a certain degree of awareness of the user's general preferences, current activities and real time condition [2]. In a word the system needs knowledge about the context in which user and system itself are acting. Context perception and understanding involves all the issues related to intelligent sensors and the management of heterogeneous information sources. As a human being perceives through his senses a huge amount of information and exploits them to decide for his actions, an artificial intelligent system based on contextual sensing must be provided with the appropriate sensors set and with the not easily achievable ability to extract interesting data at a higher abstraction level [6]. The central concept of context awareness represents the possibility for the system of biasing itself and its reactions to the environment [7][8]. A key role among many useful features is represented by the detection of the user position inside the monitored environment because many applications are location dependent. The successful location of objects of potential interest and their identification are still open issues in the state of the art; anyhow different positioning approaches are available based on: Video [9] and Radio Signals [10]. The wide diffusion of radio devices on the market has given the opportunity to improve the functionality of SSs as most of the moving devices are equipped with such systems. The identification of users is not a problem for Radio-Based Systems (RBS) while is a challenge for Video- Based ones (VBS). The easier implementation of location tasks for RBSs has the price of less accurate localization data measurements. A tradeoff solution is then a system able to integrate heterogeneous sensors to perform localization exploiting the features of these two systems. Pursuing this aim, an architecture exploiting CCD-Video Cameras and 802.11 Wireless LAN positioning methodologies is presented; in particular the paper specifically addresses one of the first step towards fusion that is, according to a popular Data Fusion model [10], Data Alignment. It is easy to understand that the development of such a system is challenged by a large number of open problems, not last the design of an architecture assembling the fundamental functions of a Smart Space: Perception, Analysis, Decision, and Action (including Communication with the user). The aim is then the one to define a general structure able to take into account the main issues related to the management of the many different heterogeneous technologies characterizing an Ambient Intelligence environment. First of all in this work we propose a logical architecture we think has the generality and the completeness to allow the analysis of many of the possible problems raised by a Smart Space. An interesting inspiration point to deal with this kind of issue is to study the principles at the bases of the human brain working. A good inspiration can be found in [11] where a model for self consciousness is reported and motivated on neuro-physiological bases. This chapter is organized as follows: after this introduction, section 2 reports the most known ambient intelligence system implementations in the state of the art; section 3 defines the main issues and functionalities characterizing an ambient intelligence system; the proposed architecture and its inspiring model is described in section 4 while some concepts about the central topic of context awareness can be found in section 5. Some results for the location sensing task are depicted in section 6 and finally in 7 we draw some conclusions about the work. © 2005 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.",

      "abstract": "Recent efforts in satellite communication research considered the exploitation of higher frequency bands as a valuable alternative to conventional spectrum portions. An example of this can be provided by the W-band (70-110GHz). Recently, a scientific experiment carried on by the Italian Space Agency (ASI), namely the DAVID-DCE experiment, was aimed at exploring the technical feasibility of the exploitation of the W-band for broadband networking applications. Some preliminary results of DAVID research activities pointed out that phase noise and high Doppler-shift can severely compromise the efficiency of the modulation system, particularly for what concerns the aspects related to the carrier recovery. This problem becomes very critical when the use of spectrally efficient M-ary modulations is considered in order to profitably exploit the large amount of bandwidth available in the W-band. In this work <sup>12</sup>, a novel carrier recovery algorithm has been proposed for a 16-QAM modulation and tested, considering the presence of phase noise and other kinds of non-ideal behaviors of the communication devices typical of W-band satellite transmission. Simulation results demonstrated the effectiveness the proposed solution for carrier recovery and pointed out the achievable spectral efficiency of the transmission system, considering some constraints about transmitted power, data BER and receiver bandwidth. © 2005 IEEE.",

In order to solve such complex situations, different kind of techniques have been integrated but the focus of the paper is on the data association step in the fusion chain. As discussed in the text, failing in the association phase means computing wrong position during fusion process.

Starting from the hypothesis that the user actions have a direct influence on internal system state variables (e.g. work load on personal computers computation or storage devices in a University laboratory, in our current test implementation) we developed a statistical voting algorithm for inferring cause/effect relationships in these instantaneous variations.

      "abstract": "In this paper, a theoretical approach for the analysis of synchronization performances in GNSS receivers adapted to reduce errors, especially caused by multipath fading, in a urban environment is proposed. In particular, two kinds of bi-frequency receivers based on data fusion methods are analyzed. The performances have been evaluated by comparison of simulated results in a real case and theoretical values based on the dispersion of the S-curve, the characteristic curve output of the DLL. One way to cope with multipath effects is equipping receivers with software modules able to reduce multipath effects. This paper explains two different methods based on data fusion and in particular on fusion between different frequencies. It is shown that improvement is possible if and when the multipath can be considered independent for two frequencies properly spaced in the frequency domain. A theoretical analysis has been carried on together with computer simulation. The signal channel model has been developed with Galileo in mind to show how data fusion techniques can be applied exploiting the frequency diversity. The receiver modules taken into account are the Equal Gain Combining (EGC) and the Adaptive Gain Combining (AGC). Starting from the statistical model of a classical DLL code-tracking system, a theoretical model for both EGC and AGC is derived. To verify the correctness of the theoretical model, a simulation environment has been set up, with the possibility of varying different parameters. The multipath model is referred to an urban environment. Resells are shown both for EGC and AGC receivers. Correct decision probability in the considered cases has confirmed the results in the simulated cases.",

      "abstract": "The presented work describes an innovative architecture for multi-sensor distributed video surveillance applications. The aim of the system is to track moving objects in outdoor environments with a cooperative strategy exploiting two video cameras. The system also exhibits the capacity of focusing its attention on the faces of detected pedestrians collecting snapshot frames of face images, by segmenting and tracking them over time at different resolution. The system is designed to employ two video cameras in a cooperative client/server structure: the first camera monitors the entire area of interest and detects the moving objects using change detection techniques. The detected objects are tracked over time and their position is indicated on a map representing the monitored area. The objects' coordinates are sent to the server sensor in order to point its zooming optics towards the moving object. The second camera tracks the objects at high resolution. As well as the client camera, this sensor is calibrated and the position of the object detected on the image plane reference system is translated in its coordinates referred to the same area map. In the map common reference system, data fusion techniques are applied to achieve a more precise and robust estimation of the objects' track and to perform face detection and tracking. The work novelties and strength reside in the cooperative multi-sensor approach, in the high resolution long distance tracking and in the automatic collection of biometric data such as a person face clip for recognition purposes. © 2005 SPIE and IS&T.",

The system is able to analyze situations of interest in a given environment and to produce related contextual information. Experimental results show that video information plays a major role for what concerns both situation perception and personalized contex-aware communications. For this reason, the poropsed multisensor system automatically extracts information from multiple cameras as well as diverse sensors describing environment status. This information is then used to trigger personalized and context-aware video messages adaptively sent to users. A rule-based module is encharged to customize video messages in relation to the user profile, contextual situation and users's terminal. The systems outputs graphically generated video messages consisting of an animated avatar (i.e. Virtual Character) closing the loop on users. Proposed results validate the conceptual schema behind the architecture and the successful adaption to the analysis of different situations.",

In the proposed set-up, an omnidirectional imaging device is used in conjunction with a pan tilt zoom (PTZ) camera leading to an innovative kind of sensor that is able to automatically track at a higher zoom level any moving object within the guarded area. In particular, the catadioptric sensor is calibrated and used in order to track every single moving object within its 360 degree field of view. Omnidirectional image portions are eventually rectified and pan, tilt and zoom parameters of the moving camera are automatically adjusted by the system in order to track detected objects. In addition a co-operative strategy was developed for the selection of the object to be tracked by the PTZ sensor in the case of multiple targets. © IEE, 2005.",

      "abstract": "For a few years, multicarrier modulations have been proposed as valuable alternatives with respect to state-of-the-art single carrier ones due to their resilience against interference and channel distortion effects. In particular, many studies are arising about multicarrier-CDMA (MC-CDMA) techniques that provide improved robustness and flexibility with respect to single-carrier spread-spectrum techniques. Satellite communications considered the employment of MC-CDMA for multimedia transmission very recently, especially for what concerns the delivery of variable-bit-rate services over low-earth-orbit (LEO) satellite networks. To this aim, the problems to be faced are mainly related to the development of efficient methodologies for satellite channel estimation, equalization and multi-user detection, in order to exploit in an optimal way the natural diversity inherent to MC-CDMA. In this paper we compare two different neural-network-based approaches for efficient reception of MC-CDMA signals in the case of asynchronous, multi-user, and variable-bit-rate transmission over LEO satellite channels. The first approach introduces neural networks for supporting receiver decision. The second more sophisticated approach exploits neural networks for joint channel estimation and symbol detection. Simulation results will be presented that demonstrate the improved effectiveness of the proposed methodologies, with respect to state-of-the-art MC-CDMA detection techniques, both in terms of reduced BER and in terms of low computational complexity. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

      "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of indoor location estimation (LE) in a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) using received signal strength (RSS). The difficultly of the problem lies in the complexity of the indoor propagation channel at operating WLAN frequency of 2.4GHz, resulting in non-linear and non-Gaussian spatio-temporal RSS properties. The first contribution of this paper is the introduction of a non-parametric Nadaraya-Watson estimator for LE using location fingerprints to capture the spatial distribution of RSS. Secondly, a novel method is proposed based on fusion of multiple location fingerprints at each survey location to cope with multimodal temporal probability distributions of RSS. Experimental results using real data collected in an office environment indicate that the proposed multiple-map method outperforms the KNN-based LE methods in terms of root mean square error. © 2005 IEEE.",

A logical structure for this kind of system, inspired by a neurobiological brain model, is proposed. Through these considerations, the role and the importance of context awareness in the definition of an artificial organism showing adaptability, pervasiveness, and scalability features are described. Techniques for the definition of a multilayer context representation are explained and practically demonstrated with a test-bed. In the proposed system, a complex event classification is obtained through the fusion of heterogeneous data coming from a set of sensors thanks to the design of a self-organizing map (SOM). The SOM represents the core of the system and testing proofs show good results in the classification of the events taking place in the monitored environment. © 2005 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The GPS system improvement and the Galileo system development will increase the signal availability and therefore the GNSS system-based applications. The great evolution of GNSS based application will imply the growth of precise and fast navigation systems. The performances of GNSS systems are mostly influenced by the accuracy of the synchronization modules. In fact, loss of fine tracking means a less precise position estimation. In urban environment the receiver measurement is usually affected by errors, especially caused by multipath fading. For this cause could be useful to analyze the performances of different methodologies to solve this problem proposed in literature. In this paper, a theoretical model valid for the analysis of synchronization performances in GNSS receivers in a urban environment is proposed. The proposed model is studied under the presence of two important cause of disturbances, named gaussian noise and multipath, in the received signal. In general the S-curve is shown in the ideal case, without any source of noise. A model can permit to recognise the presence of different type of noise that act on the received signal. The validation of the method will be made comparing results derived from signals from a simulated environment with the theoretical model. Performed tests have pointed out the validity of the theoretical model in a real case.",

      "abstract": "This paper aims at focusing on the aspects concerning the physical layer design for an innovative satellite communication experiment. Such an experiment, denoted by the acronym DAVID-DCE (Data and Video Interactive Distribution - Data Collection Experiment) is based on the exploitation of the W-band (75-110 GHz) for high-bit-rate satellite transmission. The potential advantages of using of the W-band are mainly related to the great bandwidth availability, and to the absence of interference. Moreover, an expected result of the experiment is a substantive improvement in the communication system's performances in the presence of meteorological phenomena (e.g. rain) as compared with the more conventional Ka-band satellite transmission. On the other hand, problems to be faced concern the non-ideal behaviours of hardware devices employed for high-frequency digital transmission. In particular, carrier recovery and timing recovery are the most crucial signal-processing tasks to be carefully considered in the design of the physical level of the system, because they considerably suffer from hardware impairments. The purpose of this work is to illustrate the proposed solutions in terms of the most critical modulation, demodulation and synchronization design issues, together with the effects of non-ideal behaviours of hardware components on BER performances.

The system has been developed in a video surveillance context to detect, classify and track moving objects in a scene of interest. Although single camera systems could perform the tasks outlined above, they would not be able to deal with topologically complex environments such as corridor, corners and indoor locations in general. The multi-sensor approach has been used to overcome these problems, nevertheless issues arise such as data fusion, synchronization and camera calibration. The sensor fusion approach here purposed uses autonomous software agents to negotiate the combination of data and the fusion is carried out by appropriate signal processing algorithms. The system has been tested with indoor video sequences to show the system's ability to preserve identity and of correct trajectory estimation of the tracked object. © 2003 IEEE.",

Image stabilization is a necessary step to reduce the effect of camera motion when, as in this case, image sequences are acquired from a mobile platform. In this work, in order to find an efficient motion estimator, two one-dimensional characteristic curves are extracted from each video frame. Such curves are then compared in consequent frames to estimate image displacement. The proposed algorithm is suitable for real time processing and provides good performance; in order to verify its validity, it has been tested on a variety of color video-sequences taken from the point of view of trains moving along railways tracks.

The system acquires data from a set of ultrasonic sensors, a laser range finder, and several charge-coupled device cameras, and produces as output alarms that indicate potential dangerous situations, e.g., the presence of fixed or mobile obstacles in the vehicle working area. The proposed system adds to the vehicle important functionalities such as to avoid terrain holes or down slopes or to discriminate between heaps of waste to be compacted and other man-made obstacles. Data fusion allows one to increase the system's reliability and to compensate for the inaccuracies and limited operating ranges of individual sensors. Experimental results show the system's functioning both under normal operational conditions and in the presence of dangerous situations. Moreover, the performances of the system in bad environmental situations (e.g., rain, low lighting) have been evaluated.",

In particular, the use of the Shen-Nikias algorithm for multilevel signal estimation in interference-dominated communication systems is proposed. The information signal coming out from the matched filter receiver can be regarded as a multilevel signal corrupted by heavy interference due to other system users (multi-user interference) or introduced by external noise sources. In the proposed analysis we considered only the presence of multiuser interference together with AWGN noise. A heuristic, however reasonable, assumption about the autoregressive nature of the multi-user interference is considered in the paper. BER performance analysis evidences a clear improvement with respect to the conventional matched filter case, thus confirming the validity of the basic assumptions made about statistical properties of MUI and proposing HOS-based techniques as valuable alternatives to other state-of-the-art DS/CDMA detection algorithms.",

The aim of the proposed algorithm is to distinguish between changed blocks due to variations in the observed scene and noise-altered blocks that contain errors caused by channel noise. Such errors can be corrected by directly exploiting the considerable spatio-temporal redundancy of the encoded digital source without using any additional information. Experimental results, obtained through colour JPEG transmission simulations performed in the context of an actual remote video-surveillance system, compare the proposed scheme with different concealment schemes. It is proven that substantial improvements both in terms of perceptual quality and performance of the overall video-surveillance system are possible, by using the proposed algorithm as a stand-alone module or in conjunction with a relatively low-redundancy FEC coding. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

      "abstract": "This paper describes a cooperative distributed system for outdoor surveillance based on fixed and mobile cameras. In order to continuously monitor the entire scene, a fixed unidirectional sensor has been used, mounted on the roof of a building in front of the guarded area. To obtain higher resolution images of a particular region in the scene, an active pan-tilt-zoom camera has been used. The low resolution images are used to detect and locate moving objects in a scene. The estimated object position is used in order to evaluate pan-tilt movements that are necessary in order to focus the attention of the mobile-head camera on the considered object at a higher zoom level. The system is able to provide automatic change detection at multiple zoom levels. A video shot with a small zoom factor is used to monitor the entire scene from a fixed camera, while a medium and high zoom factor are used to improve interpretation of the scene. The use of a mobile camera allows one to exceed the limitations of the bounded field of view of the sensor imposed by a fixed camera. In this case it is not possible to provide a priori knowledge about the background of the scene. The proposed method for solving the non-fixed background problem for mobile cameras involves realization of a multilevel structure obtained by the acquisition of several images. The panoramic image of the whole scene is generated using a mosaicing technique. Both sensors are used to detect and estimate the precise location of a given object at different zoom levels in order to obtain a better position estimation The results presented in the paper show the validity of the proposed approach in terms ofprobabilities of false alarm and misdetection of the system and algorithms computational complexity and mean processing time. © 2002 Int.

      "abstract": "This paper presents a system for video object generation and selective encoding with applications in surveillance, mobile videophones, and automotive industry. Object tracking and MPEG-4 compression are performed in real-time. The system belongs to a new generation of intelligent vision sensors called smart cameras, which execute autonomous vision tasks and report events and data to a remote base-station. A detection module signals the object of interest presence within the camera field of view, while the tracking part follows the target to generate temporal trajectories. The compression is MPEG-4 compliant and implements the Simple Profile of the standard, capable of encoding up to four video objects. At the same time, the compression is selective, maintaining a higher quality for the foreground objects and a lower quality for the background representation. This property contributes to bandwidth reduction while preserving the essential information of foreground objects. The system performance is demonstrated in experiments that involve objects representing faces and vehicles seen from both static and moving cameras.",

      "abstract": "This paper shows a method for extending efficient algorithms for scene understanding already developed and tested for fixed cameras to a mobile camera environment. Real-time change detection methods for mobile-head cameras are introduced. The architecture of the system can be divided in two phases. During the off-line phase the system creates a panoramic multi-layer background image using a small number of static background images. In the on-line phase the system compares the acquired images with a portion of the panoramic background. Different approaches to produce the change detection images are analyzed. Experimental results are presented in order to validate the proposed methods; their evaluation is performed by using receiving operator characteristic (ROC) curves. The Neyman-Pearson statistical criterion has been used for selecting of optimal change detection threshold. The presented results, in terms of probabilities of false and correct detection rates and real-time behavior, show that one of the studied methods can be used as the basis for higher level modules of an automatic video-surveillance system. © 2002 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a system for automatic videosurveillance applications. The system has been designed to monitor outdoor environments such as car parks or streets, providing the human operator with a symbolic description of the scene. The final task of the architecture is to automatically provide alarms when specific events of interest are detected. In this way the level of automation of the system is increased as well as overall performances. One of the main drawback of traditional video surveillance systems lies in the alarm generation. This task has to be visually performed by the human operators with intrinsic limitation. The possibility of having this process automated is here described within the design of an architecture capable of acquire, process and successfully store data coming from one or more sensors.",

The tracking module is responsible for objects labeling being able to preserve objects identity even when an overlapping occurs on the image plane between different objects. A shape matching technique is used that is based on a linear Kalman filter.

      "abstract": "This Special Issue focuses on the problems of last generation surveillance systems and highlights solutions to these problems that are based on a stronger integration of techniques for multisensor data acquisition, communications and processing. This integration is possible by the common full digital perspective on which the techniques used by new systems are based. Next generation surveillance systems can be considered as an emerging application field requiring multidisciplinary expertise going from signal and image processing, to communications and computer vision. This multidisciplinary view is common to many applications in the information and communications technology (ICT) domain, such as videoconferencing and ambient intelligence.",

      "abstract": "In the past few years, the development of complex surveillance systems has captured the interest of both the research and industrial worlds. Strong and challenging requirements of modern society are involved in this problem, which aims to increase safety and security in several application domains such as transport, tourism, home and bank security, military applications, etc. At the same time, fast improvements in microelectronics, telecommunications, and computer science make it necessary to consider new perspectives in this field. The main objective of this paper is to investigate, discuss, and evaluate the impact of distributed processing and new communication techniques on multimedia surveillance systems, which represent the so-called third-generation surveillance systems (3GSSs). In particular, aspects related to the distribution of intelligence among multiple-processing and wide-bandwidth resources are discussed in detail. It is shown how distribution of intelligence can be obtained by a hierarchical architecture that partitions, in a dynamic way, the main logical processing tasks (i.e., representation, recognition, and communication) performed in a 3GSS physical architecture made up of intelligent cameras, hubs, and central control rooms. The advantages of this solution are pointed out in terms of: 1) increased flexibility and reconfigurability and 2) optimal allocation of available processing and bandwidth resources. Finally, a case study is analyzed that allows one to gain a deeper insight into a distributed surveillance system. © 2001 IEEE.",

The proposed approach is based on a novel motion-compensation method that is an adaptation of a well-known image-stabilization algorithm for visualization purposes to video-surveillance applications. In particular, the illustrated methods take into account the specificity of typical video-surveillance applications, where objects moving in a scene often cover a large part of an image thus causing the failure of classic image-stabilization techniques. In the second part of the paper, evaluation methods for image stabilization algorithms are discussed.",

      "abstract": "In the context of the Transport Finalised Project n. 2, financed by the National Research Center from 1993 to 1998, a prototype of video-surveillance system for detecting lost objects inside the remote controlled railway stations, has been developed. The interesting results showed by tests, posed the question of a possible practical implementation of the system for large-scale applications. This necessity turned into two primary research and development steps: the prototype porting on low-cost architecture (based on PC) and in the same time the feasibility study of a possible future system implementation in a remote and distributed way, in order to remote control a great number of stations. The present paper aims to illustrate the results obtained by the project operating units in both the above mentioned steps. Some technical developments originating from these results are also presented. These developments will allow to carry out systems for monitoring fixed railway infrastructure and running trains, characterised by multiple functions and high added value.",

It is known by literature that MC-CDMA techniques are much more resilient with respect to multi-user interference effects in multipath fading channels than single-carrier DS/CDMA ones. Moreover, MC-CDMA exhibits a natural capability to deliver multirate services simply by assigning to each user a variable-cardinality set of subcarriers. The achieved simulation results clearly confirmed the expected improved robustness of MC-CDMA techniques transmitting multirate data streams in frequency selective LEO satellite channels, with respect to state-of-the-art DS/CDMA transceivers.",

Different methods have been presented in literature, whose main drawback is low robustness or high computational load in analysis of cluttered scenes. In this paper a low computational algorithm for tracking non-rigid objects in cluttered scenes is presented. The proposed approach models the shape of the objects by using corners. A learning algorithm is introduced in order to automatically extract the model of the object from a short video sequence acquired immediately before merging of more objects in the scene. The adaptive model extraction mechanism strongly improves method robustness. The method is tested on an existing video-surveillance system in order to track moving objects in cluttered scenes. Results show that the proposed approach gives good performances with low-processing times. © 2000 IEEE.",

The proposed method works on the hypothesis of a fixed TV camera and it is developed in order to minimize the human intervention during the calibration process.

Other measures are simulated by using a moving object whose geometry is known and by estimating the 3D position of the object by means of an extended Kalman filter. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm, other than simplify the installation step of video-surveillance systems, considerably improves the accuracy of the calibration with respect to similar algorithms presented in the state of the art. © 2000 IEEE.",

The image sequences, acquired with a monochromatic camera placed in each guarded room, are processed by a local PC-based image-processing system, devoted to detecting the presence of abandoned objects. When an abandoned object is recognized, an alarm issue is transmitted to a remote control center, located few miles far from the guarded stations. A multimedia communication system based on direct sequence code-division multiple-access (DS/CDMA) techniques aims at ensuring secure and noise-robust wireless transmission links between the guarded stations and the remote control center, where the processing results are displayed to the human operator.

      "abstract": "In this paper, the problem of extracting and grouping image features from complex scenes is solved by a hierarchical approach based on two main processes: voting and clustering. Voting is performed for assigning a score to both global and local features. The score represents the evidential support provided by input data for the presence of a feature. Clustering aims at individuating a minimal set of significant local features by grouping together simpler correlated observations. It is based on a spatial relation between simple observations on a fixed level, i.e., the definition of a distance in an appropriate space. As the multilevel structure of the system implies that input data for an intermediate level are outputs of the lower level, voting can be seen as a functional representation of the \"part-of\" relation between features at different abstraction levels. The proposed approach has been tested on both synthetic and real images and compared with other existing feature grouping methods. © 2000 IEEE.",

The proposed method can be considered as basis for a low level image processing stage in a advanced video-surveillance system. The main feature of the algorithm is the robustness to the illumination changes in the scene: this robustness is achieved by using a background updating module working in cooperation with the change detection algorithm. The background updating method works in a different way according to speed of illumination changes. If a sudden illumination change is detected the background is heavily updated while if a slow lightning variation occurs, a continuous soft updating module is used to take into account the long-term slow illumination changes. Experimental results of an automatic people counting system including the proposed low level image processing stage indicate that the method detects changes accurately in case of time-varying illumination.",

      "abstract": "This summary aims at presenting an overview of the CEC-ESPRIT AVS-RIO (Advanced Video Surveillance - Cable Television-Based Remote Video surveillance System for Protected sites Monitoring) project. The peculiarity of the project consists both in the video-surveillance application considered (i.e., the monitoring of tourist and naturalistic places), and in the communication mean used for the remote transmission of information from the observed sites to the remote elaboration centre, which is a coaxial cable network for local community TV broadcasting (CATV network). The multimedia information is acquired by video sensors (i.e., TV cameras) and transmitted through the CATV network to a remote control centre, where a PC-based high-performance computing network (HPCN) architecture performs the image processing tasks needed by the implementation of the system functionalities. The functional specifications of the system will be briefly exposed, together with the hardware/software tools needed for the system implementation. © 1999 IEEE.",

In particular, the problems of road detection and obstacle avoidance in outdoor environments are investigated. A set of descriptive primitives (straight and circular line segments) is selected to describe 3D objects which commonly occur in road scenes, e.g., people, cars, trucks, houses, etc. First, these primitives are extracted directly from the input image of the scene, and then are grouped according to specific geometric relationships (symmetry, convergence, parallelism, closeness, etc.). Relational geometrical knowledge of the elements of a group can be used to index an object in a pure bottom-up way, so decreasing the recognition complexity by reducing the amount of data to be matched with an object model database. Results on a road image containing obstacles, which show the efficiency, accuracy and time performances of the proposed method are reported.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, a joint video-shot and layer indexing technique is presented with applications to automatic surveillance of indoor environments. A video-based surveillance system has been developed that simultaneously tracks moving objects and detects the presence of abandoned objects. Whenever an abandoned object is detected, the system is able to determine the video-shot in which a particular object (layer) appears in the guarded environment, from the first frame in which that object enters in the scene to the frame in which the object has been left. The semantic information related on both the dangerous object and the person who left it, allows the system to perform the video-shot detection and indexing tasks. What is important in a video-shot is the information related to the dangerous object present in it. For this reason a video-shot has a two level indexing: the first one is related to the characteristics of the video-shot and the second one is related to the characteristics of a particular layer.",

The proposed net is composed of three nodes, each devoted to estimating a field of variables. The first node contains available observations. The second node is associated with a coupled random field representing the estimates of the actual values of observed data and of their discontinuities. At the third node, a field of variables is used to represent parameters describing the membership of a discontinuity into a group. The edge reinforcement problem is stated in terms of minimization of local functionals, each associated with a different node, and made up of terms that can be computed locally. It is shown that a distributed minimization is equivalent to the minimization of a global reinforcement criterion.

      "abstract": "This paper describes a probabilistic technique for the coupled reconstruction and restoration of underwater acoustic images. The technique is founded on the physics of the image-formation process. Beamforming, a method widely applied in acoustic imaging, is used to build a range image from backscattered echoes, associated point by point with another type of information representing the reliability (or confidence) of such an image. Unfortunately, this kind of images is plagued by problems due to the nature of the signal and to the related sensing system. In the proposed algorithm, the range and confidence images are modeled as Markov random fields whose associated probability distributions are specified by a single energy function. This function has been designed to fully embed the physics of the acoustic image-formation process by modeling a priori knowledge of the acoustic system, the considered scene, and the noise-affecting measures and also by integrating reliability information to allow the coupled and simultaneous reconstruction and restoration of both images. Optimal (in the Maximum A-Posteriori probability sense) estimates of the reconstructed range image map and the restored confidence image are obtained by minimizing the energy function using simulated annealing. Experimental results show the improvement of the processed images over those obtained by other methods performing separate reconstruction and restoration processes that disregard reliability information. © 1998 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "This paper aims to provide a realistic modeling of a generic noise probability density function (pdf). The target is to obtain a parametric model dependent on few parameters (simple to estimate), and so general to be able to describe many kinds of noise (e.g., symmetric or asymmetric, with variable sharpness). To this end, three HOS-based models are proposed. They present different levels of generality, which increase with the number of HOS parameters used in the model. The most general and effective of these parameters are used in the asymmetric generalized Gaussian, which is expressed in terms of kurtosis, providing variable sharpness (from flat to impulsive shapes), and left and right variances (whose combination provides the same information as skewness), describing eventual deviation from symmetry. HOS-based pdf modelling is applied to optimize signal detection in non-Gaussian environments. The proposed models are used and compared in the design of locally optimum detection (LOD) tests. Promising experimental results are presented, being obtained by the application of the tests for detecting known signals corrupted by real underwater acoustic noise. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Video-based surveillance systems generally employ one or more cameras connected to a set of monitors. This kind of systems needs the presence of a human operator, who interprets the acquired information and controls the evolution of the events in a surveyed environment. During the last years efforts have been performed to develop systems supporting human operators in their surveillance task, in order to focus the attention of operators when unusual situations are detected. Image sequences databases are also managed by the proposed surveillance system in order to provide operators with the possibility of retrieving in a second time the interesting sequences that may contain useful information for discovering causes of an alarm. Experimental results are shown in terms of the probability of correct detection of abandoned objects and examples about the retrieval sequences.",

The proposed method represents an efficient alternative to the use of the vectorial deterministic solution for MRFs. The application of space filling curve transformation allows one to apply the MRF algorithm to a scalar image with N<sup>3</sup> grey levels (typically N = 256). The scalar MRF approach is based on expressing the energy function by means of the Euclidean norm in the vectorial space. This approach implies a high computational load. The new method involves a computational load lower than the vectorial case because the energy function is presented in the scalar space obtained after space filling curve based transformation.",

The method is composed by three steps: 1) extraction of the morphological skeleton from binary images, 2) projection of the skeleton function on two planes and its analytical approximation by nonuniform rational B-splines, and 3) comparison with a set of data stored into a model database. Several experiments performed on real images prove the method's validity.",

      "abstract": "The availability of a wide set of multidimensional information sources in different application fields (e.g., color cameras, multispectral remote sensing imagery devices, etc.) is the basis for the interest of image processing research on extensions of scalar nonlinear filtering approaches to multidimensional data filtering. In this paper, a new approach to multidimensional median filtering is presented. The method is structured into two steps. Absolute sorting of the vectorial space based on Peano space filling curves is proposed as a preliminary step in order to map vectorial data onto an appropriate one-dimensional (1-D) space. Then, a scalar median filtering operation is applied. The main advantage of the proposed approach is the computational efficiency of the absolute sorting step, which makes the method globally faster than existing median filtering techniques. This is particularly important when dealing with a large amount of data (e.g., image sequences). Presented results also show that the filtering performances of the proposed approach are comparable with those of vector median filters presented in the literature. © 1997 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "A new set of non linear signal and image processing operators is presented. Their definition is based on the introduction of the statistical properties of Bayesian reconstruction in soft morphological operators. Statistical soft operators represent a trade-off between the noise cleaning properties of statistical morphology and the shape preservation properties of soft morphology. The main characteristic of these operators is the individualization of two parts within each structuring element (SE) according to soft morphology (i.e. `hard' and `soft' SEs), and to define on this basis a probabilistic estimation model which is a generalization of the Statistical Morphology model. Results are presented to show that the statistical soft morphological operators can be considered robust to structured noise, i.e. noise showing both statistical (e.g. additive Gaussian noise) and morphological (e.g. noise with a particular shape) structure.",

The proposed approach is based on two-step probabilistic process: (a) belief updating, which consists in computing a functional cost at each node of the network and, (b) belief maximization, which depends on maximizing this functional cost by using a stochastic optimization algorithm. The architecture of an image processing system, consisting of three modules connected in a chain-like structure, is presented as an example showing the capabilities of the proposed approach. Each module is provided with a priori information about the set of parameters that manage a particular data transformation, and with evaluation criteria to judge data quality and to decide on the parameters to be adjusted. Experimental results obtained by using a digitally controlled camera and lens objective, are presented to show the validity of the proposed approach.",

      "abstract": "This paper describes a voting-based approach for the fast automatic recognition of man-made objects and related attitude estimation in underwater acoustic images generated by forward-looking sonars or acoustic cameras. In general, the continuous analysis of sequences of images is a very heavy task for human operators and this is due to the poor quality of acoustic images. Hence, algorithms able to recognize an object on the basis of a priori knowledge of the model and to estimate its attitude with reference to a global coordinate system are very useful to facilitale underwater operations like object manipulation or vehicle navigation. The proposed method is capable of recognizing objects and estimating their two-dimensional attitude by using information coming from boundary segments and their angular relations. It is based on a simple voting approach directly applied to the edge discontinuities of underwater acoustic images, whose quality is usually affected by some undesired effects such as object blurring, speckle noise, and geometrical distortions degrading the edge detection. The voting approach is robust, with respect to these effects, so that good results are obtained even with images of very poor quality. The sequences of simulated and real acoustic images are presented in order to test the validity of the proposed method in terms of average estimation error and computational load.",

      "abstract": "An adaptive strategy for regulating the intrinsic parameters of a charge coupled device (CCD) visual camera is presented. The parameter regulation procedure is based on the computation of the \"quality\" of an acquired signal by means of a set of functions which estimate the goodness of the datum. Each function performs a quantitative evaluation by computing several features derived from the high-frequency content of an image or from the histogram analysis. The regulation strategy uses such values to compute the actual values of the camera parameters, i.e., focusing distance, aperture diameter, electronic gain, and black level. Moreover, the same strategy can be applied both to the whole image and to smaller suhareas, therefore providing a fooisof-attention mechanism. This is useful for automatic investigation and control of environments subject to dynamically changing conditions (e.g., illumination and structure of a scene), whenever it is not possible to interact directly with such environments. © 1996 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "A distributed optimization framework and its application to the regulation of the behavior of a network of interacting image processing algorithms are presented. The algorithm parameters used to regulate information extraction are explicitly represented as state variables associated with all network nodes. Nodes are also provided with message-passing procedures to represent dependences between parameter settings at adjacent levels. The regulation problem is defined as a joint-probability maximization of a conditional probabilistic measure evaluated over the space of possible configurations of the whole set of state variables (i.e., parameters). The global optimization problem is partitioned and solved in a distributed way, by considering local probabilistic measures for selecting and estimating the parameters related to specific algorithms used within the network. The problem representation allows a spatially varying tuning of parameters, depending on the different informative contents of the subareas of an image. An application of the proposed approach to an image processing problem is described. The processing chain chosen as an example consists of four modules. The first three algorithms correspond to network nodes. The topmost node is devoted to integrating information derived from applying different parameter settings to the algorithms of the chain. The nodes associated with data-transformation processes to be regulated are represented by an optical sensor and two filtering units (for edge-preserving and edge-extracting filterings), and a straight-segment detection module is used as an integration site. Each module is provided with knowledge concerning the parameters to regulate the related processing phase and with specific criteria to estimate data quality. Messages can be bidirectionally propagated among modules in order to search, in a distributed way, for the \"optimum\" set of parameters yielding the best solution. Experimental results obtained on indoor images are presented to show the validity of the proposed approach. © 1996 IEEE.",

The target is to obtain a model depending on few parameters (quick and easy to estimate), and so general to be able to describe many kinds of noise (e.g., symmetric or asymmetric, with variable sharpness). To this end, a new HOS-based model is introduced, which derives from the generalized Gaussian function and depends on three parameters: kurtosis (fourth order), for representing variable sharpness, and left and right variances (whose combination provides the same information of skewness - third order) for describing deviation from symmetry. The model is applied in the design of a LOD test for detecting signals corrupted by real underwater acoustic noise in a low-frequency range.",

A set of detection methods is examined and compared in order to establish their feasibility and performances by considering detection probability values as the selected parameters vary.

The main advantage of this method is the possibility of extracting and matching 2D straight segments directly in the feature space, without the need for complex matching operations and time-consuming inverse transformations. An additional advantage is that only four attributes of 2D straight segments are required to perform an efficient matching process: position, orientation, length, and midpoint. Tests were performed on both synthetic and real images containing complex manmade objects moving in a scene. A comparison with a well-known 2D line matching algorithm is also made.",

Relationships are established between the quantization threshold, rank of the equivalent rank-order filter and parameters of the model. It is also shown that basic BSM operators, i.e. binary statistical dilation and binary statistical erosion can be used as the basis for defining more complex filters.

A set of features extracted from each acquired image is related to the number of people monitored. The static declarative knowledge describing the correlation between a feature value and the estimate of the number of people is represented by nonlinear piecewise models. The proposed estimation approach exploits temporal information by means of a distributed Kalman filter network. The current crowding estimate is derived from the application of the static correlation models to the extracted observations (evidence), combined with the prediction obtained from the temporally previous estimate (expectation). This approach improves the estimation accuracy obtained by using only current available data (i.e., static knowledge), and can predict crowding values between two successive acquisitions, i.e., at those steps at which new data cannot be available. Extensive experimental tests carried out in the field (a metro station) yielded very promising results in terms of estimation accuracy and real-time response capability.",

      "abstract": "A two-level probabilistic method for grouping edge-based descriptive primitives is proposed. At the lower level, a voting mechanism based on the Direct Hough Transform is employed in order to obtain a relational graph whose nodes correspond to a set of straight segments extracted from an edge image. The nodes are linked to each other according to geometrical relationships (i.e., parallelism, collinearity, convergence) among the detected segments. At the higher level, the grouping process consists of assigning a label to each node. Subsets of nodes with the same label are identified as consistent segment groups. A nonlinear cost function is used as a measure evaluating the goodness of every proposed configuration of labels. Such a measure is interpreted as an energy function related to the probability of a field configuration derived from the Gibbs distribution; this corresponds to modeling the label graph as a Markov Random Field (MRF). The energy function is formed by the interactions of local terms with precise geometrical significances. The label MRF is characterized by a multiple neighborhood system and, hence, by multiple cliques. A Simulated Annealing algorithm is used to find the best label configuration. The approach has been tested on a wide number of synthetic and real scenes and related results are provided to show the capabilities of the proposed approach. © 1996 Academic Press, Inc.",

      "abstract": "The work is addressed to provide realistic modelling of a generic noise probability density function (pdf), in order to optimize signal detection in non-Gaussian environments. The target is to obtain a model depending on few parameters (quick and easy to estimate), and so general to be able to describe many kinds of noise (e.g., symmetric or asymmetric, with variable sharpness). To this end, a new HOS-based model is introduced, which derives from the generalized Gaussian function, and depends on three parameters: kurtosis, for representing variable sharpness, and left and right variances (whose combination provides the same information of skewness) for describing deviation from symmetry. This model is applied in the design of a Locally Optimum Detection (LOD) test. Promising experimental results are presented which derived from the application of the test for detecting signals corrupted by real underwater acoustic noise.",

      "abstract": "In the context of digital signal processing addressed to underwater acoustic communications, this work focuses attention on the optimization of detection of weak signals in presence of additive independent stationary non-Gaussian noise. In order to detect signals in the case of low SNR values, the selected binary statistical testing approach consists in a Locally Optimum Detector (LOD), designed on the basis of a new proposed HOS-based model of non-Gaussian noise probability density function (pdf). In particular, an 'asymmetric Gaussian' pdf model is introduced, in order to describe realistically non-Gaussian noise in a very simple way. The resulting test has been compared with the Gaussian-hypothesis LOD test. Experimental results have shown significant advantages in modelling noise pdf on the basis of the proposed pdf function; they derive from the application of the LOD test for detecting known deterministic signals corrupted by real acoustic ship-traffic-radiated noise.",

      "abstract": "The task of object identification is fundamental to the operations of an autonomous vehicle. It can be accomplished by using techniques based on a Multisensor Fusion framework, which allows the integration of data coming from different sensors. In this paper, an approach to the synergic interpretation of data provided by thermal and visual sensors is proposed. Such integration is justified by the necessity for solving the ambiguities that may arise from separate data interpretations. The architecture of a distributed Knowledge-Based system is described. It performs an Intelligent Data Fusion process by integrating, in an opportunistic way, data acquired with a thermal and a video (b/w) camera. Data integration is performed at various architecture levels in order to increase the robustness of the whole recognition process. A priori models allow the system to obtain interesting data from both sensors; to transform such data into intermediate symbolic objects; and, finally, to recognize environmental situations on which to perform further processing. Some results are reported for different environmental conditions (i.e. a road scene by day and by night, with and without the presence of obstacles).",

      "abstract": "Reconstruction of object surfaces from sparse measures is an ill-posed inverse problem which requires a priori knowledge to be regularized. This problem becomes more difficult whenever an active method is used and a scattering medium is present between the signal source and the scene observed. This paper describes a reconstruction method that can be applied to solve a microwave imaging problems. The goal of the proposed algorithm is to obtain a pixel-based representation of 2-D object slices. The objects are assumed to be inhomogeneous dielectric scatterers in a microwave electromagnetic field. The method is based on the hypothesis that the observed field is a Markov Random Field (MRF), and consists in finding the field configuration that maximizes the a posteriori probability measure associated with the MRF model. A specific probabilistic measure that is based on a weak-membrane regularizing constraint as an a priori model and on an observation model using a near-field hypothesis is proposed. A classical stochastic optimization approach (i.e., simulated annealing with a Metropolis sampler) is adopted to find the probabilistic maximum. The capabilities and effectiveness of the method are evaluated and compared with those of other approaches requiring matrix inversion. Finally, simulation results are reported that show better reconstructions, than those obtained by other microwave image domain methods. © 1995.",

      "abstract": "The Hough transform is a robust technique for analysis of straight lines in images containing noise and occlusions, but involves a considerable computational load and storage problems when it is used to recover circles, ellipses or more complex patterns. This paper presents an efficient technique for circular arc detection, called the circular direct Hough transform (CDHT), which aims to reduce the drawbacks affecting classical Hough-based approaches (i.e., low speed, loss of spatial information, and spurious-peak generation) without increasing the memory requirements. A modified parametrization is used to represent a circle by a couple of dependent equations of the first order (instead of the classical equation of the second order (x - x<inf>0</inf>)<sup>2</sup> + (y - y<inf>0</inf>)<sup>2</sup> - r<sup>2</sup> = 0) and a clustering phase is introduced to detect different circular arcs belonging to the same circle. Results are reported to describe and quantify the performances of the CDHT in terms of accuracy, robustness to noise, computational efficiency, and storage. Comparisons are made between the proposed method and some representative Hough-based algorithms (Yip et al., 1992; Duda and Hart, 1972), using both synthetic and real images. Circle detection in crowd images, where circular patterns are associated with human heads, is described as an application to show the robustness of the method. © 1995.",

      "abstract": "In the present paper, multiple-hypothesis static knowledge modelling is introduced in the distributed inference mechanism of Extended Kalman Filters presented in [1]. The extension from single to multiple modelling based on spatial constraints the system performances to be improved and the system functionalities to be extended (in terms of types and number of parameters to be estimated from acquired data): the present system provides in real-time not only crowding density estimation but also people tracking in real-life complex environments. The target has a major role in the field of surveillance of complex environments. It is reached by extracting from sequences of images a set of significant features, correlated with the number of people present in the monitored scene. The proposed new approach consists in providing each feature-extractor node with several possible non-linear models and with a classification procedure for selecting the most suitable one. A probabilistic approach has been developed in order to track the monitored groups of people by means of a graph-based time and space knowledge representation.",

      "abstract": "This paper aims at describing a visual surveillance prototype system able to monitor a bounded (in depth) area by using a depth-from-focus approach. The single visual camera utilized is characterized by an adjustable lens objective controlled by a host computer. In this way, the system is capable to detect possible intruders entering in the controlled zone, recovering the range information by a depth-from-focus method, and tracking the incoming entity by using a simple strategy. Tracking is performed by computing the range distance such as to keep in focus the moving object that has violated the area. This method is based on an adaptive regulation strategy of the camera parameters which makes the system robust to lighting variations occurring in real environment. Preliminary results show the goodness of the proposed approach, especially concerning the depth information recovery.",

      "abstract": "A comparison is performed among three edge detectors operating on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images: Canny filter, Ratio detector and Multilevel Deterministic Annealing with a speckle noise model. The first method represents classical edge extractors, based on a regularised estimation of the derivatives of the image function. The Ratio Detector is an example of a Constant False Alarm Rate methods used for edge detection in speckle-noise, which rely on a detection criterion independent from the average gray-level of the decision region. The method defined Multilevel Deterministic Annealing is based on a non-linear statistical criterion which takes into account not only local properties of the image function, but also its global characteristics. The three detectors are evaluated on the basis of false-alarm and detection errors computed on the basis of the apriori known output of a synthetic scene. A qualitative evaluation on real images is also provided. It is shown that Multilevel Deterministic Annealing provides better results despite of a higher computational load.",

Using dynamic knowledge allows the system to track groups of people, dynamically interacting each others, on the image plane over time.

      "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to describe a noncoherent correlation technique for the formation of 3-D acoustic images, mainly for underwater applications. This technique is applied to the envelope of signals received by a 2-D array. The performances of the technique are compared with those of the coherent technique of focused beamforming in terms of angular resolution, depth of field, beam pattern, and accuracy in range determination. Moreover, special attention is given to the modalities for an efficient implementation on a digital computer. The complete absence of grating lobes, for whatever arrangement of the transducers, and the much higher speed of the imaging process, as compared with that of beamforming in the time domain, are the two major advantages of this technique. A reduction in the speckle effect, the possibility of creating a virtual depth of field, the feasibility of using square-law transducers, and the implementation simplicity are additional interesting characteristics. The results of some simulations are reported and compared with those obtained by the beamforming process. © 1994 IEEE",

      "abstract": "A distributed 3D scene recognition system based on a multilevel representation of object models and signals is described. The solution to a recognition problem is obtained through a set of object-observation couples at the different abstraction levels. The various system modules exchange two kinds of information: 1) top-down messages, which are used to communicate to lower modules the predictions made on the basis of a priori knowledge on the application domain, 2) bottom-up messages, which are used to communicate to higher modules the evidence supporting possible local solutions. A local scheme for the combination of message flows is defined, and messages are interpreted by using a probabilistic network of estimators of random variables. The proposed model is suitable for addressing the problem of distributed geometric reasoning aimed at 3D road scene recognition by an autonomous vehicle. Recognition results include road detection and obstacle localization, together with a study of the relative computational load required by different modules of the system. The proposed approach is currently simulated on a workstation, while an effective implementation on board of an autonomous vehicle is under development in the contest of the CEC-EUREKA Prometheus project. © 1994 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, an algorithm for grouping edges belonging to straight lines is presented. The algorithm uses as input data a labeled set of edge points represented by a list of coordinate-label pairs. The output is a graph whose nodes are rectilinear segments linked by relational properties. Collinearity, convergence, and parallelism can be easily taken into account. The main novelty of the method lies in extending the use of the Hough transform to a symbolic domain (i.e., labeled edges); it is shown that edge labeling can be used to partition the Hough space and to isolate contributions coming from different image areas. Moreover, it is demonstrated that a simple focusing mechanism can be applied (in order to speed up the matching with 3D models) by using relational properties provided by the output graph. In order to confirm the algorithm′s performances, results on synthetic images containing randomly generated textures of straight lines are presented. Finally, a complex road image is considered to point out the advantages of using the proposed representation and the attention-focusing mechanism to solve real-world problems. © 1994 Academic Press.

Each IP module adaptively transforms input data passed by lower-level modules into more complete observations and performs a transformation that is modeled as a regularization process. This scheme is applied to the problem of recognizing objects whose 3-D shape can be described as a set of planar surfaces. Edge detection, straight-line extraction, grouping, and matching are the IP modules considered. In particular, the regularization process consists of either a voting scheme or a Markov random field labeling process, depending on the level. At the higher level, a degree of belief is given about the presence of objects contained in the scene and considered in the model database. Results demonstrate both the validity of the processes applied separately at each level and the global consistency of the method.",

Some significant features extracted from each acquired image are related to the number of people present in the monitored scene by using non-linear models obtained by means of Dynamic Programming in an off-line training phase. The present approach, employing previously obtained estimates, both improves accuracy of estimation, with respect to an evaluation based only on present available data, and can predict crowding values without new dala, between two successive acquisitions.

The recognition problem is partitioned into a set of less complex subproblems by associating with each representation level expert processing units that filter out unreliable solutions and focus attention on promising ones. In this way, the search space for possible solutions is limited in a distributed way, as a priori knowledge about observations and constraints is used at multiple levels. Different instances of the same inference mechanism are applied at each level. As a consequence, each processing unit is able to search autonomously for a local solution in order to contribute to obtaining a globally consistent solution. An important characteristic of the system is to be easy to maintain and extend. The results reported have been obtained by using multisensory images of real scenes considered in the context of an autonomous-driving application.

A new implementation of the Hough Transform (HT), called Labeled Hough Transform (LHT), to extract and group symbolic features is here presented; the novelty of this method, in respect to the traditional approach [1], consists in the capability of splitting a maximum in the parameter space into non-contiguous segments, while performing voting. Results are presented on a road image containing obstacles which show the efficiency, good quality and time performances of the algorithm.",

The associative classification module must supply a rough suggestion about the observed scene to a top-down expectation-driven recognition system. Easy training, low computation times, and ordering alternatives according to their evaluated reliabilities are some of the most important advantages of the approach described. Experimental results show that the classification mechanism operates correctly also in the presence of very similar training patterns.

To this end, different physical sensors (i.e, RGB or IR camera, laser range finder, etc.) which can provide information of the image type can be used. Moreover, virtual sensors (i.e., processes which simulate new sensors by transforming in different ways original images) can be obtained by Computer Vision techniques. In this paper, we present a knowledge-based data fusion system with a distributed control, which integrates data both at physical and at virtual sensors level, by pursuing segmentation and interpretation goals. Outdoor road scenes, with and without obstacles are considered as an applicative test set. © SPIE.",

Environmental information is used to improve recognition results and to locate a vehicle's position in the coordinate reference frame of a map. To this end, a hypothesis-and-test search mechanism has been developed, which is based on an associative phase and a symbolic. In particular, an associative memory is first used to address the possible territorial area where the scene under examination may have been acquired. This guess is then verified by a symbolic recognition system using a model-driven strategy.",

The high complexity of this operation is reduced by acquiring, filtering, segmenting, and extracting features (described by means of frames) from each separate sensor channel. Procedural knowledge (production rules) drives the fusion process, linking to a symbolic frame all the segmented regions characterized by similar properties.

      "abstract": "In this paper some improvements in the vector quantization technique are presented. The development of high performance coding techniques for color images is of major importance for the high compression coding framework, previously realized at DIBE. First Linde-Buzo-Gray (LBG) algorithm was improved by introducing a non-supervised neural classifier to choose the starting vector codebook; this strategy allows one to reach better solutions than a random initial choice. Then a ‘split & merge’ algorithm for codebook vectors was tested in order to obtain a more uniform distribution of the samples of the training sequence among the alphabet letters. Concerning the codifing process, a predictor was designed which allows a considerable reduction in the redundancy remaining after vector quantization, by exploiting the residual ‘inter-block’ spatial correlation. During the encoding/de-coding process, the next block can be predicted on the basis of the neighboring blocks, using four spatial-transition probability matrices. The system performance, in terms of SNR, ranges from 28 to 31 dB for a bit rate of about 0.15 bpp; it should be pointed out that the introduction of the predictor produces a sharp reduction of the bit-rate, without loss of information. © 1989 SPIE.",

The final goal is to achieve a high compression ratio for both transmission and storage purposes. The coding system has been developed within the framework of the European Project PROMETHEUS.

      "abstract": "Multisensor data fusion is applied to the problem of detecting and identifying obstacles in a static (or slowly-changing) known scene. Automatic detection of unexpected objects is of crucial importance in reducing the need for personnel in surveillance stations: possible applications to the area of rail transportation systems are currently being explored, and results for a level crossing monitoring situation are presented. This paper defines a framework that allows the exploitation of multiple sensors or multiple operation modes of a single sensor: as an example, it describes a way of merging the data coming from two channels (the RG bands of a color video camera), each providing two intensity images (the actual scene and the \"normal\" background). Moreover, the system can profit by the introduction of additional sensors, like a Laser Range Finder to aid in locating obstacles in 3D space. The proposed system architecture is based on a blackboard organization for both inference and control: particular care has been exercised in optimizing the data flow through system modules by means of a heterarchical control structure. Object-oriented programming is extensively used to isolate the system's basic units in order to allow a future parallel implementation. © 1989 SPIE.",

      "abstract": "The natural world is typically made up of 3D objects characterized by more or less complex internal structure. The purpose of this work is to investigate some 3D natural objects by fractal geometry and to discuss the results of texture-based segmentation. We suggest extending the use of fractals to 3D data (voxel type) by a fractal preserving approach. This approach achieves two opposite goals: Reduction of noise effects and homogeneity of fractal dimension (F) values. To calculate F we select the most homogeneous neighbourhood (in terms of fractal dimension) around each voxel using a focusing mechanism and a minimum-variance criterion. The validity of the proposed methodology has been confirmed by analyzing a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spatial sequence of a human head; in fact different complex structures has been enhanced. © 1988 SPIE.",
