      "abstract": "Renewable Energy Communities (RECs) are being deployed all around the World as a technically feasible solution to decreasing users' dependence on fossil fuels. Several demonstration facilities have shown their potential to provide final consumers with clean energy and all associated environmental benefits. However, the economic evaluation of these systems as a whole set is more complex than evaluating generation technologies individually, which can be considered a barrier, and it may be more complicated to calculate its uncertainty with precision. This paper deals with this challenge and adapts a model for the evaluation of the global Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) of a polygeneration microgrid to the characteristics of a typical REC, allowing the assessment of the distribution of the LCOE depending on the uncertainty of the input parameters. Thanks to its simple analytical formulation, the proposed model, that can be used for any combination of technologies (both renewable and conventional), provides relevant information on uncertainty propagation in a symbolic way that avoids the need to run numerical simulations or make assumptions on the distribution of the random input parameters. A case study has been presented, considering a typical small electrical REC with photovoltaic plants and micro wind turbines. Although the model can be defined to any market, as a representative example, it has been evaluated according to the current Spanish and Italian regulations, which are analyzed in depth with reference to the scientific literature. Results show that uncertainties in parameter estimates give rise to a very large scatter in the LCOE, pointing out a set of quantities whose role is crucial for a reliable estimate, among which electricity purchase and selling prices, yearly power load, and self-consumption / virtually-shared energy rates stand out.",

      "abstract": "The integration of renewable energy sources in the European power system is one of the main goals set by the European Union. In order to ease this integration, in recent years, Renewable Energy Communities (RECs) have been introduced that aim to increase the exploitation of renewable energy at the local level. This paper presents an Energy Management System (EMS) for an industrial microgrid owned and operated by a greentech company located in the north of Italy. The company is a member of an REC. The microgrid is made of interconnected busbars, integrating photovoltaic power plants, a fleet of electric vehicles, including company cars and delivery trucks supporting Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G), dedicated charging stations, and a centralized battery energy storage system. The industrial site includes two warehouses, an office building, and a connection to the external medium-voltage network. The EMS is designed to optimize the operation of the microgrid and minimize the operating costs related to the sale and purchase of energy from the external network. Furthermore, as the company is a member of an REC, the EMS must try to follow a desired power exchange profile with the grid, suggested by the REC manager, with the purpose of maximizing the energy that is shared within the community and incentivized. The results demonstrate that, when minimizing only costs, local self-consumption is favored, leading to a Self-Sufficiency Rate (SSR) of 65.37%. On the other hand, when only the adherence to the REC manager’s desired power exchange profile is considered in the objective function, the SSR decreases to 56.43%, net operating costs increase, and the energy shared within the REC is maximized.",

The mathematical model incorporates the capability curves of the inverters connected to DERs and allows for curtailment of PV and WT units, with curtailment costs assessed using the Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE). Penalties for the absorption of reactive power from the external network are considered and evaluated in accordance with the current regulatory framework. Optimal Power Flow (OPF) equations are integrated into the EMS model, too. A preliminary analysis, carried out on a simplified MG, evaluates the impact of linearizing the DERs capability curves and OPF equations on the EMS's outcomes. Finally, a sensitivity analysis evaluates the impact of different operational constraints and of different objective function formulations on the operation of the MG, discussing key energy and economic results.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a tool that allows to perform an ex-ante estimation of the profitability to participate to the electric energy and service markets for a microgrid or a polygeneration power plant. The tool is the evolution of an Energy Management System (EMS) previously developed by the University of Genoa and Renantis Solutions Srl. Constraints are added to the original EMS to model the Ancillary Service Market (ASM) and Day Ahead Market (DAM) mechanisms in the framework of a planning tool that allows to get estimates of the microgrid/plant costs and revenues over a long-time horizon. As the market outcome strongly depends on the Transmission System Operator (TSO) acceptance/rejection of bids and offers, a statistical approach is proposed. The optimization process is split in two steps: the first one optimally dispatches the energy units and proposes DAM offers and ASM bid and offers over a specified time horizon. Then, a Monte Carlo method is launched; at each extraction the TSO acceptance/rejection of each ASM bid and offer is simulated and there is a second step of optimization in which the energy sources are optimally re-dispatched to meet the bidding program and so to avoid imbalance power exchange that would increase the energy cost. The cost/revenue is thus computed at each extraction. The result is the probability density function of the costs/revenues that allows to estimate the profitability of the participation to the electricity markets. One test performed on a real microgrid shows that the computational time needed to complete one iteration related to a time horizon of one month is approximately 20 s. Moreover, the comparison of the outcomes with two independent launches to define the set of bids and offers to be accepted in ASM demonstrates that the statistical analysis allows to avoid misleading conclusions on the costs/revenues. Consequently, the fact that the developed EMS allows to perform a statistical analysis in a reasonable time enables the possibility of comparing multiple scenarios and gives an indication related to the range of cost/revenues in which the microgrid/plant may incur. Finally, the computational efficiency of the proposed approach allows to conclude that the developed EMS is appropriate to perform a long-time horizon (of the order of magnitude of years) analysis and, at the same time, allows to model all the involved components with a high level of details.",

      "abstract": "Energy management systems (EMSs) play a central role in improving the performance of microgrids by ensuring their efficient operation while minimizing operational costs and environmental impacts. This paper presents a comprehensive study of mixed integer linear programming (MILP) based EMSs developed and implemented in MATLAB 2021a using YALMIP software for the energy management of a new positive energy district in the city of Savona, Italy, as part of the Interreg Alpine Space Project ALPGRIDS. The main objective of this research is to optimize the functioning of the microgrid, focusing on cost efficiency and environmental sustainability. In pursuit of this objective, the EMS undergoes comprehensive testing and analysis, replicating actual conditions and addressing the diverse demands of end-users across typical days throughout the year, considering real electricity selling and purchase prices. The EMS also accounts for the reactive power capabilities of the various technologies integrated into the microgrid. The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) serves as a metric for assessing curtailment costs, while penalties related to reactive power absorption from the distribution network are appraised in alignment with prevailing regulatory guidelines. The case study provides valuable insights into the practical implementation of EMS technology in microgrids and demonstrates its potential for sustainable energy management in complex urban energy districts. In all scenarios, the battery energy storage system (BESS) and combined heat and power (CHP) are pivotal for load satisfaction and microgrid resilience. BESSs balance supply and demand, which are crucial in periods of low renewable energy availability, while the versatile CHP efficiently addresses energy demands, contributing significantly to overall microgrid effectiveness. Their synergy ensures reliable load satisfaction, showcasing the dynamic and adaptive nature of microgrid energy management across diverse scenarios.",

The experimental analyses conducted on a scale model of the roofing structure yield appropriate coefficients that enhance the precision of estimating wind-induced pressures. These coefficients aid in optimizing the structure and ensuring its safety, effectively preventing overdesign while identifying areas of high peak pressure on the roof. Comparisons with regulatory guidelines and literature examples regarding the roof in isolation emphasize the significance of conducting a comprehensive analysis that considers the influence of surroundings for sustainability. Furthermore, transfer coefficients of the flow velocity are derived from the experimental analysis to translate the wind climate in the area to the pedestrian level. Pedestrian comfort analyses are performed using conventional methods, as well as considering the actual hourly variation of wind speed and daily activities within the university campus. This analysis encompasses the influence of vegetation and explores potential mitigation strategies, offering a fresh perspective to assess the liveability of the area, particularly suitable for specific social spaces such as university campuses.",

      "abstract": "One of the main ways to reach the important targets of the European Commission in the energy field set by 2030 is to implement sustainable energy systems to cover electrical and thermal energy demands, as well as transportation needs, in urban areas. In the aforesaid scenario, multi-vector energy hubs consist of installing small and medium size power plants, mainly fed by renewable sources, and charging infrastructures for electric vehicles in sustainable urban districts. The optimal design of such systems can be faced from different points of view and using different methods, one of the most adopted being the development of mathematical programming algorithms typically aimed to minimize global costs and emissions. The contribution of this paper is to propose an innovative methodology to optimally design a multi-vector energy hub able to supply electricity and thermal energy, for space heating and cooling, to a set of buildings within a sustainable district acting as a local energy community. The developed mixed integer linear programming model is characterized by very detailed models of the technologies and by a multi-objective function which is proposed to evaluate the impact of the optimal solution on global costs and emissions. The proposed mathematical model is very comprehensive as it involves a wide range of energy technologies with detailed modelling by considering the impact of external ambient conditions and energy vector temperature values on the plant conversion efficiency, thus showing high replicability potential in real contexts. In the case study, the model is applied to a university campus in the North of Italy.",

The EMS problem is formulated as a multiperiod convex optimization problem and solved using AL-SODU, a new distributed algorithm based on the augmented Lagrangian method with second order dual updates. The proposed AL-SODU algorithm significantly outperforms state of the art algorithms employing first order dual updates, with 15-times speedup in convergence speed. A case study of the EMS based on AL-SODU is conducted on the Smart Polygeneration Microgrid (SPM) located on the Savona Campus of University of Genova (Italy). The EMS determines the optimal schedules for electric and thermal power plants every 15-minutes. This real time scheduling of the microgrid is enabled by the Al-SODU algorithm, which solves the scheduling problem in 1.86s.",

      "abstract": "Lightning represents one of the most critical issues for electrical infrastructure. In dealing with overhead distribution line systems, indirect lightning strikes can lead to induced voltages overcoming the critical flashover value of the line, thus damaging the insulators. The computation of lightning-induced voltages requires the modeling of the lightning current, the evaluation of the lightning electromagnetic fields and the solution of the field-to-line coupling equations. The numerical calculation of the lightning electromagnetic fields is time-consuming and is strongly dependent on the lightning channel modeling and soil properties. This article presents a review of the most widely adopted methods to calculate the lightning electromagnetic fields, starting from the classical formulation, which requires numerical integration, and highlighting the most effective approaches that have been developed to reduce computational effort. This is done first for the case of a perfectly conducting ground, then the available formulations to account for the ground finite conductivity are presented together with their possible implementations in both the frequency and time domains.",

      "abstract": "European countries aim to reach important targets in the energy field through the increase of energy efficiency in final uses, the exploitation of renewable energy sources, and the implementation of energy communities. In the aforesaid framework, renewable energy self-consumers represent a smart solution to foster the adoption of renewable energy power plants and storage systems in the residential and tertiary sectors. The goal of the paper is to propose an optimization-based methodology to evaluate the impact of electric mobility on the optimal design of renewable energy collective self-consumers. The integration of renewable sources and storage systems with charging infrastructures for electric vehicles is analyzed and discussed by running a stochastic optimization model, developed in Matlab/Yalmip, to evaluate different scenarios with different electric mobility penetration levels. The paper shows how the presence of electric vehicles increases the optimal installed size of the RES plants significantly, from 15% up to more than 25%. Moreover, it underlines how the optimal charging system, in terms of type, number, and size of charging stations, is affected by the considered number of electric vehicles but also by the model and thus the characteristics of the electric vehicles such as the maximum accepted charging power in AC and DC modes.",

      "abstract": "To face the complexity introduced by the ever-increasing participation of new energy sources, storage systems and controllable loads to electricity markets, Distributed Energy Systems must optimize the power exchange. Usually, Energy Management System (EMS) are used to manage Micro-Grids (MGs) operations, but computational timings may become prohibitive, due to high number of constraints and links between parameters and technical constraints. This paper describes the evolution of the Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) MATLAB Based Energy Management System (MB-EMS) developed at the University of Genoa, aimed at optimizing the operating costs of a MG or plant, considering technical constraints and limitations of electrical and thermal production units, energy storage systems, non-programmable loads and flexible loads. Costs related to maintenance interventions and CO<inf>2</inf>emissions costs are also included, as well as incentives related to the High-Efficiency Cogeneration systems. Specific test cases for a real MG are solved in a short computational time over a time horizon of one year. Calculations are rapidly performed, also when dealing with 15 minutes resolution problems. In this sense, the developed tool can be used both as a real time scheduler, as instance for participation in the energy market sector, and in long term planning problems.",

      "abstract": "Lightning may be the cause of outages and faults on electrical infrastructures. In overhead distribution lines, voltages overcoming the critical flashover value of the line may be induced by indirect lightning strikes, and this fact may cause serious damages to insulators. Consequently, the assessment of induced voltages is an important aspect in the design phase of transmission and distribution lines. To this goal, the lightning current shall be modeled, the electromagnetic fields should be evaluated and the field-to-line coupling equations implemented. In case time dependent functions are considered, the lightning electromagnetic fields may also be numerically approximated, but, usually, such approximation requires significant computational efforts and strongly depend on the way in which the lightning channel is modeled and on the soil properties. The present paper proposes an overview of the most utilized methodologies aiming at numerically or analytically approximating the lightning electromagnetic fields. Under the hypothesis of perfectly conducting ground, the classical formulation, requiring numerical integration is firstly presented. Then, the most effective approaches aiming at reducing computational timings are discussed. Finally, the models available to represent the lightning tortuosity are presented.",

      "abstract": "Since 2011, the University of Genoa (UniGe), Italy, focused on sustainable management of its campuses. In one of them, the Savona Campus, research and projects are specifically focused on Sustainable Energy and Smart City topics. Great efforts were made to reduce the carbon footprint by the creation of two large Research Infrastructures (a Smart Microgrid and an energy self-sufficient building) integrating different renewable energy sources and system automation. These infrastructures allowed to improve the energy performance of the Campus. Several actions have been then carried out also in the Genova Campus, including the implementation of a system for the real-time monitoring of the consumption of electricity for the most energy-intensive buildings. Results permitted to reduce energy consumption and provided significative and practical guidelines for energy saving. In 2015, the UniGe Commission on Environmental Sustainability was created and since then UniGe joined several international sustainability networks, such as ISCN (International Sustainable Campus Network) and UNICA GREEN (Network of Universities from the Capitals of Europe), sharing its best practices with other universities. UniGe is also active member of the Italian Universities’ Network for Sustainable Development (RUS). In 2022 UniGe made a strong and explicit pledge against climate change, defining its Climate Neutrality Strategy 2022-2030. The strategy, starting from its latest UniGe greenhouse gases (GHG) inventory, outlines a path that the university must follow to reduce both direct and indirect emissions and defines the actions to do for the offsetting of residual emissions. This is the last step of the strong and continuous commitment towards the spreading of the sustainability culture in all the Campus activities.",

This physical characteristic of lightning has remarkable effects on the generated electromagnetic fields and, consequently, on the voltage induced on transmission and distribution lines, which may lead to insulator flashover. This contribution presents a novel semi-analytical approach for the calculation of lightning electromagnetic fields considering channel tortuosity with an arbitrary current source. Results are validated against a benchmark numerical method showing fine accuracy and an improvement in computational efficiency. Indeed, the proposed approach avoids the time-consuming convolution integral on the source current which, on the contrary, is required by the benchmark numerical method.",

      "abstract": "A bi-level building management system for optimal temperature control and scheduling of electric vehicles in a smart building is proposed. The architecture allows considering automated decisions, both for operational management and real-time control, minimizing costs and the dissatisfaction of different requirements (electric vehicles' charging, demand response). A particular feature of the building management system is that it includes a model for electric vehicles' charging (both for vehicles-to-grid and classical electric vehicles) that can consider three-phases unbalanced systems and the inputs required by the Charging Stations, i.e., the set point for the current for each plugin use. Moreover, a distributed approach for the optimal control of fan coils is proposed that allows adjusting the temperature in each room. The developed building management system has been tested at the Savona Campus in a building characterized by a photovoltaic field, a geothermal heat pump, EVs charging infrastructure, thermal storage, and a fan coil circuit. The tests carried out at the Campus show that the proposed algorithm allows a reduction of the daily costs of about 20% with respect to a simple heuristic, without compromising the fulfillment of the charging requests of the electric vehicles. The savings can be increased till close to 35% if a demand response is also exploited.",

A new optimization model has been developed in which the objective function is related to the minimization of costs, the maximization of the overall exergy efficiency of the system, and the minimization of stress indexes. To solve efficiently the optimization problem, a novel algorithm based on an accelerated version of the Bregman Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (with Heavy Ball dual acceleration term) has been developed and discussed. The decision model has been applied to a real case study represented by the Savona Campus of the University of Genova in Italy. A sensitivity analysis has been performed for evaluating the effect of each term of the objective function on the solution.",

      "abstract": "Aiming at integrating different energy sectors and exploiting the synergies coming from the interaction of different energy carriers, sector coupling allows for a greater flexibility of the energy system, by increasing renewables’ penetration and reducing carbon emissions. At the local level, sector coupling fits well in the concept of an integrated local energy community (ILEC), where active consumers make common choices for satisfying their energy needs through the optimal management of a set of multi-carrier energy technologies, by achieving better economic and environmental benefits compared to the business-as-usual scenario. This paper discusses the stochastic operation optimization of the smart Savona Campus of the University of Genoa, according to economic and environmental criteria. The campus is treated as an ILEC with two electrically interconnected multi-energy hubs involving technologies such as PV, solar thermal, combined heat and power systems, electric and geothermal heat pumps, absorption chillers, electric and thermal storage. Under this prism, the ILEC can participate in the day-ahead market (DAM) with proper bidding strategies. To assess the renewables’ uncertainties, the roulette wheel method is used to generate an initial set of scenarios for solar irradiance, and the fast forward selection algorithm is then applied to preserve the most representative scenarios, while reducing the computational load of the next optimization phase. A stochastic optimization model is thus formulated through mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), with the aim to optimize the operation strategies of the various technologies in the ILEC, as well as the bidding strategies of the ILECs in the DAM, considering both energy costs and carbon emissions through a multi-objective approach. Case study results show how the optimal bidding strategies of the ILEC on the DAM allow minimizing of the users’ net daily cost, and, as in the case of environmental optimization, the ILEC operates in self-consumption mode. Moreover, in comparison to the current operation strategies, the optimized case allows reduction of the daily net energy cost in a range from 5 to 14%, and the net daily carbon emissions in a range from 6 to 18%.",

      "abstract": "The ever-increasing participation of new energy sources, storage systems and controllable loads to electricity markets has introduced more complexity in the operation of power plants, microgrids (MGs) and networks. To face these issues, it is often necessary to design Distributed Energy Systems to optimize the power exchange. Usually, MG operation is managed by an Energy Management System (EMS) dealing with large amounts of parameters to be taken into account and that may drive to problems difficult to be faced and requiring long computational timings. In this direction, this paper describes the Mixed Integer Linear Programming MATLAB Based Energy Management System (MB-EMS) developed at the University of Genoa, aimed at optimizing the operating costs of a generic polygeneration system, considering different electrical and thermal production units, energy storage systems, non-programmable loads and flexible loads. Many important technical details are accounted: the duration and costs related to maintenance interventions and CO<inf>2</inf> emissions costs are considered for all production units as well as constraints and incentives related to the High-Efficiency Cogeneration systems. Constraints related to the minimum and maximum State-Of-Charge of energy storage systems, plus their deterioration, with the consequent optimization of their utilization, are also modelled. Specific test cases for all functionalities are presented. Moreover, a test related to a real MG performed over a time horizon of one year with a time step of 1 h is performed and solved in a short computational time. The linearization of constraints reduces the computational effort, avoiding the need of clustering or averaging parameters for similar production units. Consequently, calculations are rapidly performed, also when dealing with long term planning problems (a realistic test case with time horizon of one year and time step of 15 min can be simulated in some seconds). In this sense, the developed tool can be used both in real time operation and in long term planning problems.",

The procedure considers downward negative first, negative subsequent, and positive return strokes, taking into account the number of strokes per flash (flash multiplicity) and the distance among return stroke impact points within the same flash (stroke terminations distance). The analysis of the effect produced using LLS data on the estimated number of flashovers per year on the test line is achieved by replacing one by one the standard distributions and parameters typically adopted in the literature, with those inferred from the LLS, when they can be considered reliable. Results show that adopting LLS-inferred parameters and distributions produces significant (positive or negative) variations in the estimated number of flashovers with respect to values computed with the standard approach.",

      "abstract": "Lightning electromagnetic (EM) fields are typically computed by assuming the current propagation within a straight vertical channel of negligible cross section. However, it is well known that the lightning path is tortuous and this can significantly affect the radiated fields and the lightning-induced voltages on power lines. Lupò et al. (2000) proposed an analytical method evaluating the EM fields radiated by a tortuous channel assuming a step current source; to consider an arbitrary (realistic) current source, a slow-converging convolution integral was applied. The aim of this article is to reduce the computation time of such procedure by extending to the tortuous channel case the approach proposed by Brignone et al. (2021) for the evaluation of the lightning EM fields with arbitrary current source, originally developed for a straight vertical channel. The performances of the present method are evaluated by means of comparison with the solution proposed by Lupò et al. (2000), showing an excellent agreement with a significant reduction of the CPU effort. This in principle will allow the computation of lightning-induced overvoltages at both individual and statistical level without a prohibitive computational effort.",

      "abstract": "This paper develops a Dynamic Market Mechanism (μDMM) to optimally allocate electric and thermal power in a combined heat and power microgrid. The market mechanism is formulated as a receding horizon constrained optimization problem, from which an optimal automated transactive procedure is developed. Its operation is distributed in nature and incorporates the most up-to-date electric and thermal load estimates and renewable generation. The results of the market clearing of the proposed microgrid μDMM are the spot prices and schedules for electric and thermal power in addition to non-binding estimates of future prices and set-points. The performance of the μDMM is illustrated using simulation studies of a Combine Heat and Power (CHP) microgrid model based on the Smart Polygeneration Microgrid (SPM) located on the University of Genova Savona Campus. The results show that the μDMM has the ability to adapt to new information via updated forecasts and improve the performance of microgrid operation compared to a centralized method. This in turn makes the μDMM attractive for use in μEMS (microgrid Energy Management Systems) by allowing new energy resources to be added in a plug and play fashion.",

      "abstract": "The Smart Polygeneration Microgrid (SPM) at the Savona Campus of the University of Genoa consists of several renewable and traditional electrical and thermal generating units integrated with electric batteries; buildings and facilities are connected by an electrical grid and a district heating network. Thermal and electrical power flows are managed by a proper Energy Management System (EMS) which includes models for all the SPM components ensuring operational costs minimization in compliance with networks constraints. The present study focuses on the integration of a thermal energy storage (TS) system in the SPM: to this aim, a new thermal storage model based on a stepped two-zone approach has been built inside the dynamic EMS solver. The TS is conceived for recovering additional heat from two 65kW<inf>el</inf> cogenerative gas turbines (CGT), thus minimizing the operation time of the backup gas heaters (GH): the analysis is aimed at inferring the best TS size in terms of different key parameters, expressed through properly defined economic and energy criteria, including overall energy consumption, reduced greenhouse emissions, minimum payback period. The model is applied to energy demand data (heat and electricity) as measured at 15 min time steps along 2 years. The present dynamic analysis shows that an optimized size TS based on sensible heat can increase the CGT operation hours up to 34% yearly and reduce the equivalent CO<inf>2</inf> emissions by 4%.",

In particular, the research activity conducted by the University of Genoa and Ansaldo Energia company is focused on the small-scale cogeneration plants operating in the Italian Ancillary Services Market and evaluates the profitability of their inclusion within Virtually Aggregated Mixed Units. The developed methodology based on a technical and economic analysis is described and different scenarios are analyzed using as test case a typical installation of the 100 kW cogeneration microturbine produced by Ansaldo Energia. The affordability of choosing cogeneration technologies instead of traditional energy supply systems is critically investigated with the main goal of proposing and comparing some new innovative remuneration mechanisms for the services provided in the market by small-scale cogeneration units. The advantages for both the owner of the cogeneration plant and electrical system operators are described and the current legislative flaws are highlighted.",

      "abstract": "A microgrid is a group of interconnected loads and distributed generation sources that acts as a single entity with respect to the public grid. The implementation of a microgrid providing energy to different users located in the same urban area can lead to environmental and economic benefits. Nowadays many urban redevelopment projects are opting for microgrids to reduce energy bills and to meet the criteria of positive energy districts. In this paper the optimal planning of a microgrid with the help of HOMER Grid software is accomplished. The simulation of the annual operation of the microgrid is performed applying all the required constraints to obtain the optimal sizing of the installed technologies consisting of PV plants, storage battery systems, CHP units, and micro wind turbines. Different scenarios are analyzed as a function of variable electricity purchase and selling prices, as well as considering current incentive mechanisms. The analyzed microgrid has been designed in the city of Savona, in the North of Italy, within the Interreg Alpine Space ALPGRIDS project.",

      "abstract": "To support the global transition towards a climate-neutral economy by 2050, countries all over the world are implementing low carbon and energy efficiency policies. This is leading to a rapid increase in the installations of distributed generation technologies. A hybrid system consisting of two or more energy sources could provide a more reliable supply of energy and mitigate storage requirements. In this context, this paper develops an environmental early analysis by the employment of a simplified Life Cycle Assessment approach. The above-mentioned approach is used to investigate the environmental performances of the hybrid energy system of the smart polygeneration micro-grid of the University Campus of Savona, which integrates photovoltaics and combined heat and power generators with an electricity storage system. Moreover, two further comparison scenarios are analyzed: electricity demand met by importing energy from the electricity grid (Scenario 1) and management of cogeneration plants to primarily satisfy thermal demand (Scenario 2). An early environmental assessment analysis shows that the cogeneration systems have a predominant weight on the majority of the environmental impact categories analyzed. On the other hand, the PV systems are the most responsible for the impacts on human toxicity cancer effects (35%), freshwater ecotoxicity (60%), and resource depletion (72%); while the energy imported from the grid has a predominant weight on freshwater eutrophication (55%). Finally, the results show that the alternative scenarios investigated are responsible for higher environmental impacts than the case study. The only exceptions are represented by the resource depletion for Scenario 1 and the global warming potential for Scenario 2. In fact, for these indicators, the base case shows higher environmental impacts than those of the alternative scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Indirect lightning strokes represent and important source of damage for overhead distribution systems. For the correct evaluation of lightning-induced overvoltages, the frequency dependence of the electrical parameters of the soil should be considered. Therefore, this paper proposes a simplified approach which selects a representative frequency according to the front time of the current waveform at the base of the lightning channel and takes advantage of an approximate formula for the lightning-induced overvoltage peak which is available in the literature. The most relevant strengths of the proposed method are the simplicity of implementation and the reduced process time, which is extremely lower than that required by more sophisticated numerical methods. These characteristics make the proposed approach a simple and practical tool. The results show overvoltage decreases above 35 percent for soils of low conductivity. Therefore, the frequency dependence of the electrical parameters of the soil plays an important role.",

      "abstract": "For the study of lightning performance of distribution lines, the correct assessment of indirect flashes plays an important role. Thus, this paper considers the frequency-dependent soil electrical parameters in a previously developed approximate formula for the peak value of lightning-induced overvoltage on overhead lines. This approach consists of using a specific frequency (based on the lightning front time) to estimate the ground conductivity. Since the proposal is easy to implement and fast to run in any computational environment, it is a practical engineering tool. According to the results, it is possible to note the importance of applying models that take into account the variation of soil parameters with frequency, since overvoltage reductions for high resistivity soils above 35% were verified.",

      "abstract": "The deployment of Energy Communities can help to increase the provision of sustainable energy from renewable energy sources at urban, industrial, and commercial levels, granting benefits to all the community members. Their effective integration in the form of microgrids (and nanogrids) will undoubtedly help to decarbonize the energy sector and, at the same time, increase energy resiliency. The main purpose of this book is to provide a systematic framework for the calculation of the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOEn) for Energy Communities proposing a general formulation and its application to three representative real case studies. To the authors’ knowledge, the existing literature does not address this issue yet. This book is intended for researchers, academics and postgraduate students in energy engineering and economics, promoters of energy projects, policymakers and, in general, for anyone interested in energy sustainability and renewable energy integration. In this chapter, we present the context and the aim of the book, its organization and a brief biographical sketch of the authors.`",

      "abstract": "In this chapter we present the fundamentals of the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOEn) focusing on renewable power plants and multi-vector energy systems. After having introduced the basic formulation for the LCOEn, we extend its definition to polygeneration systems, hybrid systems (generators working in parallel with energy storage devices as a single unit) and microgrids/nanogrids. Although we focus on the LCOE (Levelized Cost of Electricity) we also analyze other variants of LCOEn (i.e., Levelized Cost of Stored Energy: LCOS, Levelized Cost of Heat: LCOH, and Levelized Cost of Cooling: LCOC). Furthermore, we present a novel approach to analyze multi-vector energy systems and we propose the Levelized Cost of Exergy (LCOEx) as a new useful indicator in the field.",

      "abstract": "As reported in the “Clean energy for all Europeans package” set by the EU, a sustainable transition from fossil fuels towards cleaner energy is necessary to improve the quality of life of citizens and the livability in cities. The exploitation of renewable sources, the improvement of energy performance in buildings and the need for cutting-edge national energy and climate plans represent important and urgent topics to be faced in order to implement the sustainability concept in urban areas. In addition, the spread of polygeneration microgrids and the recent development of energy communities enable a massive installation of renewable power plants, high-performance small-size cogeneration units, and electrical storage systems; moreover, properly designed local energy production systems make it possible to optimize the exploitation of green energy sources and reduce both energy supply costs and emissions. In the present paper, a set of key performance indicators is introduced in order to evaluate and compare different energy communities both from a technical and environmental point of view. The proposed methodology was used in order to assess and compare two sites characterized by the presence of sustainable energy infrastructures: the Savona Campus of the University of Genoa in Italy, where a polygeneration microgrid has been in operation since 2014 and new technologies will be installed in the near future, and the SPEED2030 District, an urban area near the Campus where renewable energy power plants (solar and wind), cogeneration units fed by hydrogen and storage systems are planned to be installed.",

      "abstract": "Short-term electric power forecasting is a tool of great interest for power systems, where the presence of renewable and distributed generation sources is constantly growing. Specifically, this type of forecasting is essential for energy management systems in buildings, industries and microgrids for optimizing the operation of their distributed energy resources under different criteria based on their expected daily energy balance (the consumption–generation relationship). Under this situation, this paper proposes a complete framework for the short-term multistep forecasting of electric power consumption and generation in smart grids and microgrids. One advantage of the proposed framework is its capability of evaluating numerous combinations of inputs, making it possible to identify the best technique and the best set of inputs in each case. Therefore, even in cases with insufficient input information, the framework can always provide good forecasting results. Particularly, in this paper, the developed framework is used to compare a whole set of rule-based and machine learning techniques (artificial neural networks and random forests) to perform day-ahead forecasting. Moreover, the paper presents and a new approach consisting of the use of baseline models as inputs for machine learning models, and compares it with others. Our results show that this approach can significantly improve upon the compared techniques, achieving an accuracy improvement of up to 62% over that of a persistence model, which is the best of the compared algorithms across all application cases. These results are obtained from the application of the proposed methodology to forecasting five different load and generation power variables for the Savona Campus at the University of Genova in Italy.",

      "abstract": "The integration of electric mobility with energy systems based on renewable sources represents one of the main pillars of sustainable cities and, in particular, of Local Energy Communities. This leads to reduce the environmental impact in urban areas and contributes to the implementation of the microgrid concept. Electric mobility services mainly include the use of electric buses, car sharing, bike sharing, and e-scooters. The aforesaid services fit well with university campuses where the transportation demand is considerable and sustainability is a challenging target. In this framework, the present paper aims to propose a methodology to optimally define and design electric services for a Local Energy Community which takes energy from a microgrid based on the exploitation of renewable energy sources and storage systems. The study considers the application of the proposed methodology, based on a mixed-integer linear programming model, to a university campus in Italy. Starting from the analysis of the results of a survey created to identify the needs of end-users, the model determines the optimal configuration of the electric mobility system made of shuttles, cars and bikes as well as charging points. The optimization model also investigates the opportunity of upgrading the set of renewable energy and storage technologies present in the microgrid of the campus to which the electric mobility infrastructures will be connected. In the paper some different scenarios are analyzed in order to compare the proposed electric mobility services from the technical and economic point of view, referring to the considered case study.",

      "abstract": "The article provides analytical expressions for the electromagnetic fields generated by a lightning return stroke characterized by a channel-base current with arbitrary time waveform, in presence of either a perfectly conducting or a lossy ground, assuming the transmission line model for the current along the channel. In this second case, a time-domain analytical expression for the Cooray-Rubinstein formula is presented. The main idea that leads to the derivation of analytical formulas consists of dividing the channel into intervals in which the distance between the field source point and the observation point can be approximated with a linear function of the time, and of the spatial coordinates of both points. In the companion aticle, a detailed comparison is proposed with the classical (numerical) approach highlighting an excellent agreement both at close and far distances, considering all the values of practical interest for the ground conductivity. Moreover, the method guarantees a meaningful improvement in computational performance.",

Usually, when one want to analyze such effects it is necessary to rely on approximate models or to simplify in some ways the power system. As a consequence, an overall analysis taking into account the complexity of the power system is difficult to find. This paper presents the study of the electromagnetic transients caused by lightning events in a point of connection between a real power plant and a large power grid. The analysis is achieved with a high level of details of the power system and the simulations are obtained through an EMT-type software (PSCAD-EMTDC). Different simulations are analyzed, showing how the cables and the transformers are affected by the electromagnetic transients.",

This aspect can be usually accepted, but, as will be discussed in this paper, it cannot be omitted when we deal with overhead distribution lines with high Critical Flash-over value (CFO) and small diameters.

      "abstract": "Nowadays, Distribution System Operators are increasing the digitalization of their smart grids, making it possible to measure and manage their state at any time. However, with the massive eruption of change-distributed generation (e.g., renewable resources, electric vehicles), the grid operation have become more complex, requiring specific technologies to balance it. In this sense, the demand-side management is one of its techniques; the demand response is a promising approach for providing Flexibility Services (FSs) and complying with the regulatory directives of the energy market. As a solution, this paper proposes the use of the OpenADR (Open Automated Demand Response) standard protocol in combination with a Decentralized Permissioned Market Place (DPMP) based on Blockchain. On one hand, OpenADR hierarchical architecture based on distributed nodes provides communication between stakeholders, adding monitoring and management services. Further, this architecture is compatible with an aggregator schema that guarantees the compliance with the strictest regulatory framework (i.e., European market). On the other hand, DPMP is included at different levels of this architecture, providing a global solution to Flexibility Service Providers (FSP) that can be adapted depending on the regulation of a specific country. As a proof of concept, this paper shows the result of a real experimental case, which implements a Capacity Bidding Program where the OpenADR protocol is used as a communication method to control and monitor energy consumption. In parallel, the proposed DPMP based on Blockchain makes it possible to manage the incentives of FSs, enabling the integration of local and global markets.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, Distribution System Operators are increasing the digitalization of their smart grids, making it possible to measure and manage their state at any time. However, with the massive eruption of change-distributed generation (e.g., renewable resources, electric vehicles), the grid operation have become more complex, requiring specific technologies to balance it. In this sense, the demand-side management is one of its techniques; the demand response is a promising approach for providing Flexibility Services (FSs) and complying with the regulatory directives of the energy market. As a solution, this paper proposes the use of the OpenADR (Open Automated Demand Response) standard protocol in combination with a Decentralized Permissioned Market Place (DPMP) based on Blockchain. On one hand, OpenADR hierarchical architecture based on distributed nodes provides communication between stakeholders, adding monitoring and management services. Further, this architecture is compatible with an aggregator schema that guarantees the compliance with the strictest regulatory framework (i.e., European market). On the other hand, DPMP is included at different levels of this architecture, providing a global solution to Flexibility Service Providers (FSP) that can be adapted depending on the regulation of a specific country. As a proof of concept, this paper shows the result of a real experimental case, which implements a Capacity Bidding Program where the OpenADR protocol is used as a communication method to control and monitor energy consumption. In parallel, the proposed DPMP based on Blockchain makes it possible to manage the incentives of FSs, enabling the integration of local and global markets.",

This facility is not allowed to inject surplus energy into the public distribution power grid in order to minimize network congestions. As stationary energy storage devices are not competitive at nanogrid level nowadays, the smart charging of electric vehicles seems to be a feasible and cost-effective solution. The paper describes the Mixed-Integer Linear Programming model which has been specifically developed to operate the nanogrid optimally allowing a 76% reduction of the curtailed energy in comparison with the same system without the smart charging station, and a 67% daily savings in comparison with a traditional consumer of the same size and characteristics.",

In the present paper an optimization algorithm is used to assess the possible impact of the vehicle to grid (V2G) technology to minimize solar photovoltaic (PV) uncertainties due to forecasting inaccuracies. In particular, forecasted values from the PVGIS database are compared with actual measurements from the Savona Campus facility and the exploitation of the V2G technology to mitigate discrepancies between the two datasets is investigated. Results show the impact of the initial state of charge (SOC) of the electrical vehicles (EVs) at the beginning of the day on the capability of balancing either the overestimation or the underestimation of the PV production. Moreover, a great influence is given by the number of involved EVs and the charging/discharging power limits of the charging stations.",

An improved understanding of the phenomenon is important for warning and safety applications, in order to perform reliable risk assessment to respond to impacts. The introduction of Lightning Location Systems (LLS) helped mitigating threats since 1920. This contribution is focused on LLSs for intra-cloud and cloud-to-ground discharges, aiming at presenting an overview on the working principles of the most used techniques to locate lightning.

The developed tertiary control system offers a coordinated active-reactive power optimization model for the Pulau Ubin distribution network equipped with an energy storage system, a solar panel field and three biodiesel generators. The aim is to minimize the operation costs and the voltage deviation of the distribution network, managing simultaneously both the active and reactive resources. The results have been validated through a simulation of daily operation carried out by the hour. Upon the successful implementation, this system can serve as a model for the future microgrid embedded in the new SIT campus in Punggol neighbourhood.",

      "abstract": "In the latest times, power markets in Europe, including the Spanish one called MIBEL (Mercado Ibérico de Electricidad), are being deregulated and coupled. As a result, electricity can be easily purchased and sold across further areas and countries. On the other hand, trying to guarantee renewable projects profitability, Power Purchase Agreements and Options contracts are arising as a feasible solution. The problem arises when the power plant owners have to negotiate the purchase electricity price in order to optimize risks and profits, as well as make future plans. Thus, several methods for Electricity Price Forecasting (EPF) have been developed and presented, showing different results, as market spot prices suffer from strong seasonality, spikes and high volatility. In this paper, three methods, based on Deep Learning Dynamic Neural Networks (NAR, NARX and LSTM) applied to forecast MIBEL electricity spot prices are discussed in order to evaluate their adequacy, accuracy and reliable horizon.",

Typical users of lightning information are meteorological agencies, aviation or air traffic authorities, land management entities, electric power transmission and distribution operators and other public utilities. Nowadays the lightning strike hazards may be properly managed by using well performing Lightning Location Systems (LLS). All sensors and devices of a network used to detect and locate lightning events can be featured by parameters that numerically describe reliability, precision and ranges of operation. This paper proposes an overview on the main parameters of LLSs: Detection Efficiency, False Alarm Rate and Location Accuracy. The effects of Detection efficiency on cloud-to-ground flashes are discussed. Examples of performance parameters of LLS networks in the Mediterranean area are proposed and, finally, two ground truth reference towers are presented.",

      "abstract": "Solar photovoltaic (PV) plants coupled with storage for domestic self-consumption purposes seem to be a promising technology in the next years, as PV costs have decreased significantly, and national regulations in many countries promote their installation in order to relax the energy requirements of power distribution grids. However, electrochemical storage systems are still unaffordable for many domestic users and, thus, the advantages of self-consumption PV systems are reduced. Thus, in this work the adoption of hydrogen systems as energy vectors between a PV plant and the energy user is proposed. As a preliminary study, in this work the design of a PV and hydrogen-production self-consumption plant for a single dwelling is described. Then, a technical and economic feasibility study conducted by modeling the facility within the Homer Energy Pro energy systems analysis tool is reported. The proposed system will be able to provide back not only electrical energy but also thermal energy through a fuel cell or refined water, covering the fundamental needs of the householders (electricity, heat or cooling and water). Results show that, although the proposed system effectively increases the energy local use of the PV production and reduces significantly the energy injections or demands into/from the power grid, avoiding power grid congestions and increasing the nano-grid resilience, operation and maintenance costs may reduce its economic attractiveness for a single dwelling.",

      "abstract": "In recent decades, many EU and national regulations have been issued in order to increase the energy efficiency in different sectors and, consequently, to reduce environmental pollution. In the building sector, energy efficiency interventions are usually based on the use of innovative insulated materials and on the installation of cogeneration and tri-generation units, as well as solar technologies. New and retrofitted buildings are more and more commonly being called \"smart buildings\", since they are characterized by the installation of electric and thermal power generation units, energy storage systems, and flexible loads; the presence of such technologies determines the necessity of installing Building Energy Management Systems (BEMSs), which are used to optimally manage their operation. The present paper proposes a BEMS for a smart building, equipped with plants based on renewables (photovoltaics, solar thermal panels, and geothermal heat pump), where the heating and cooling demand are satisfied by a Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning System (HVAC) fed by a geothermal heat pump. The developed BEMS is composed of two different modules: An optimization tool used to optimally manage the HVAC plant, in order to guarantee a desired level of comfort inside rooms, and a simulation tool, based on an equivalent electric circuit model and used to evaluate the thermal dynamic behavior of the building. The paper describes the two modules and shows the main results of the validation phase that has been conducted on a real test-case represented by the Smart Energy Building (SEB) located at the Savona Campus of the University of Genoa, Italy.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents an energy management platform based on a receding-horizon scheme for the optimal control of active and reactive power flows in microgrids, including small-size photovoltaic, combined heat and power, wind generation, mini-hydro, and energy storage. The objective function to be minimized can be set both on the daily operational costs (economic indicator) and on the global CO<inf>2</inf> emissions of the system (environmental indicator), whereas decision variables are the production schedules of the generators and the power flows across the grid. The tool includes the technical constraints characterizing low voltage/medium voltage (LV/MV) microgrids and gives the user the possibility to select different models for the electrical network (nonlinear power flow equations, linear approximation, and single bus-bar) and different optimization ranges. The energy management system has been validated through an experimental campaign on the smart polygeneration microgrid of the University of Genoa, which provides electricity and thermal energy to the Savona Campus, an 'open-air' demo-site of an environmentally sustainable urban district with a population of about 2200 people. The results of the tests on the field highlight the robustness of the developed platform and the capability of the receding-horizon algorithm at the core of it of successfully treating data uncertainties.",

      "abstract": "A microgrid can be considered a profitable solution to be adopted in smart cities if it is marketable, i.e. more, or at least equally convenient than other traditional energy supply sources. Different economic parameters can be defined to determine its affordability. In particular, the LCOE (Levelized Cost of Electricity) is the most popular indicator adopted in the energy sector, widely used both for conventional and renewable power sources. However, the use of this metric still disregards important aspects that concerns microgrid applications. After providing a state-of-the-art of the use of LCOE, the present paper proposes a new methodology for sustainable microgrids in smart city, taking into account benefits due to cogeneration and trigeneration, integration costs as well as positive and negative side effects.",

      "abstract": "One of the most important and studied topics in lightning research is the development of suitable models for the return stroke current and electromagnetic fields. In particular, when dealing with the so-called engineering models, the definition of a function that expresses the attenuation of the current while flowing in the discharge channel (from now on, the attenuation function) is of crucial importance for a reliable computation of the lightning discharge electromagnetic fields and the resulting over voltages induced in a power distribution electric system. The paper contributes to such topic in two ways: first of all, a review of all the well-known engineering models is presented, highlighting the definition of each attenuation function and comparing the models in terms of the resulting overvoltage induced on a typical distribution line. Secondly, an innovative idea based on the possibility of reconstructing the attenuation function starting from the measured electromagnetic fields is presented. The state of the art in this research line is outlined and the issues that are still open are presented. In particular the possibility of adopting the so-called regularization techniques to solve ill posed inverse problems to evaluate the current starting from electromagnetic fields is addressed analysing the available results and highlighting that, to the best of the authors knowledge, these techniques have never been applied with experimental data.",

      "abstract": "Battery systems are becoming more and more widespread for stationary applications both at power grid level and user level. In this second context, small battery-based storage systems are frequently proposed for the installation in combination with local renewable sources, to increase the self-consumption of the locally generated renewable energy and, in some cases, even to enable the user to disconnect from the main network. Increasing use of storage devices for stationary applications implies a more detailed characterization of the “behavior at the terminals” of these systems. In the same time, the development of new Energy Management Systems is required in order to take advantage of both local information and data from the service provider, such as radiation forecasts from weather forecast services. In this paper, a new EMS is proposed, characterized by a two-level architecture: the higher level, based on a receding horizon control scheme, optimally schedules the operation of the storage by using information on radiation from a forecast service provider; the lower level implements a heuristic procedure (if–then) on a low-cost local controller, in order to perform corrective actions. The proposed architecture has been tested on a real case study.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, an optimization model is defined for the design of a smart energy infrastructure integrating different technologies to satisfy the electrical demand of a given site. The considered smart energy infrastructure includes a photovoltaic plant, electrical storage systems, electric vehicles (EVs), and charging stations. The objective function of the optimization model considers the costs related to the installation and maintenance of the considered technologies, as well as the costs associated with the energy exchanges with the external grid. A very extensive numerical analysis is reported in the paper, referred to a test case in a real site in Liguria Region, in the north of Italy. Many scenarios are analyzed and discussed, with specific attention to evaluate the role of electric mobility within a smart energy infrastructure and a focus on EVs acting as mobile storage systems.",

Such LL relies on the research and demonstration activities related to the use of special infrastructures as the Smart Polygeneration Microgrid (SPM) and Smart Energy Building (SEB), built with the fundamental contribution of the Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research and the Ministry for Environment, Land and Sea Protection. The LL is jointly operated with the Italian DSO Enel S.p.A. as an 'open air' demo site for the testing of on grid/off grid electrical transitions (Sustainable Urban Energy Island) and of potentially new services strictly related to the wide deployment of 'e-city' technological solutions (V2G, V2H, e-home and smart appliances). The present paper is mainly focused on the model developed to study a portion of the SPM in islanded configuration; the main results of the analysis are here reported and discussed in order to highlight stability and load sharing issues.",

The idea is to transform the Savona Campus in a Living Lab of the City of the Future: smart technologies in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and energy sectors were installed in order to show a real application of the Smart City concept to population and external stakeholders. Moreover, special attention was given to the environment, personal wellbeing, and social equalities. The sustainable energy Research Infrastructures (RIs) of Savona Campus allowed enhancement of the applied research in degree programs and the collaboration with several companies. In particular, an important partnership with the Italian electric Distribution System Operator (DSO), ENEL S.p.A., started in 2017 to test the capability of these RIs to operate disconnected from the National Grid, relying only on the supply of renewables and storage systems. The \"Living Lab Smart City\" is an important action to reduce the carbon footprint of the Savona Campus and to increase the awareness of students, teachers and researchers towards Sustainable Development in Higher Education Institutes.",

      "abstract": "Islanded microgrids are assuming a key role for the support in the distribution grid's management, which is more and more difficult due to the massive increase of distributed generation and energy production plants from renewable resources. In this paper, a new architecture for the optimal control of tertiary and secondary levels in small-size islanded microgrids is proposed. Specifically, at each optimization step, by using a receding horizon approach, the tertiary control provides the optimal power schedule for the microgrid on the basis of economic and environmental criteria. Then, the secondary control, to provide set points for primary control, uses another objective function that minimizes the quadratic deviation from the reference values provided by the tertiary level and the desired frequency for good performances. The approach is applied to a real case study (a portion of the Savona Campus Smart Polygeneration Microgrid) characterized by a diesel engine connected to a synchronous generator, a photovoltaic plant, and an electrical storage system.",

The main decision variables of the model are the number and typology of wind turbines and cogeneration plants, the size of photovoltaic fields and the power exchange with the public grid. The optimal values of the variables come from the minimization of installation, maintenance and operational costs, and satisfy load and technical constraints. The model is applied to three districts in the Savona Municipality that represent pilot sites of an extended project concerning the planning and management of smart urban areas.

Sodium/Nickel chloride batteries are considered optimal storage systems, due to their limited environmental impact, high reliability and specific energy, and reduced maintenance. The present paper describes a mathematical model elaborated to calculate the electrical parameters, during the discharge phase, of a Sodium/Nickel chloride galvanic cell contained within an electrical storage system designed for smart grid applications.

      "abstract": "The present paper is addressed to a further development of the Energy Management System (EMS) which is implemented and running at the Smart Polygeneration Microgrid (SPM) at the Savona Campus of the University of Genova. The SPM thermal network is constituted by heat generation units (cogenerative gas turbines and gas boilers, overall thermal power about 1MWth) and a network of pipelines providing the heat to a series of buildings during the daily working hours. Being the electric power demand significantly present also at night, a heat storage system would be advisable for full cogeneration all day long. For this reason the existing EMS model and predictive control has been modified for taking into account the presence of a thermal storage system of suitable volume. The new operation scheme at simulation level also includes a biomass burner, to be switched on in priority with respect to the existing gas burners. The approach for modelling the heat storage, in terms mainly of storage energy content, allows the economic feasibility of the investment to be assessed when subhourly simulations of real operating conditions are performed with respect to recent historical time series of electric and heat load demand at the Savona Campus.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we deal with the problem of nowcasting and forecasting the photovoltaic power production (PvPP) on the basis of real data available for the Savona Campus and coming from the energy management systems (EMSs) of the smart polygeneration microgrid that feeds buildings in the University area. In this paper, we show how PvPP nowcast and forecast problems can be solved with the state-of-the-art data-driven techniques, which use the historical data collected by the EMS. In particular, we compare the performance of the kernelized regularized least squares, the extreme learning machines, and the random forests. In the machine learning field, these algorithms are the best choice in three different families of techniques: kernel methods, neural networks, and ensemble methods. Results show that our proposal can improve of almost one order of magnitude to the actual prediction system used in the EMS of the Savona Campus, which is based on the knowledge of the physical problem. Finally, by using the EMS installed at the Savona Campus, it has been possible to quantify the saving in costs and CO <inf>2</inf> emissions due to the new nowcasting and forecasting models.",

      "abstract": "The paper aims at presenting a methodology to choose the proper sizing of an integrated Photovoltaic unit and a storage architecture starting from the knowledge of the load and solar irradiance time profiles. To do this, first a simple logic to manage the charging/discharging of the storage is proposed, then the function representing the overall cost during the whole life of the system is derived. The computation of the cost function for different photovoltaic and storage sizes allows finding the best sizing of the system. Finally, a thorough economic analysis is conducted to provide criteria to check whether the investment is economically advantageous. This is done considering the impact of the economic variables which are more influential on the investment key assessment parameters. The proposed methodology has been validated in different realistic test cases against the results provided by an energy management system, showing an excellent agreement between the approaches. Moreover, the economic analysis has been applied to four realistic situations in order to tailor the microgrid components ratings on the specific test case.",

The upper-level optimization problem (UDP) takes into account active and reactive power flows and a detailed formalization of the system model, with the aim of minimizing costs and emissions. For the lower level decision problem (LDP), the optimal results of the UDP are taken as reference values for the plant's schedule, which can be slightly modified in real time due to the actual values of renewables and energy demands. An analytical solution for the LDP has been found, which allows a fast and simple implementation of the microgrid's schedule.",

Then, the overall cost of the whole system is deduced as a function of two variables (PV and ST sizes) and minimized in order to find the optimal sizing of the system.

      "abstract": "The number of fully-rated converter wind turbine generators equipped with a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) has sensibly increased in the late years. The optimal utilization and controllability of a PMSG is achieved using a Pulse Width Modulation – Voltage Source Converter (PWM-VSC) that allows interfacing the electric machine with the distribution network by means of a DC link. The generator/Machine-Side Converter (MSC) controls the operation of the PMSG. This paper proposes a methodology to assess the feasibility of the steady-state working points of PMSG based wind turbines without running a set of time-consuming time-domain simulations. Three control objectives for MSC are usually considered: stator voltage control, unitary power factor control and torque control. The aim of the present paper is that of providing an analytical methodology to check the feasibility of the steady-state working points dictated by different control strategies of the MSC starting from the specific operational constraints provided by the wind power plants characteristics. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated comparing numerical results of a MATLAB® implementation against dedicated time-domain simulations. Simulations results demonstrated the appropriate performance of the proposed methodology characterized by the almost negligible computational time required.",

The first part of the work is focused on the storage model's identification during the charge and discharge phases with the aim of defining appropriate constraints to be inserted in the decision model. In the higher level, an optimization problem is developed and solved under a MPC scheme. The lower level, implemented on a PLC, receives references from the higher level and applies simple heuristics rules for real time control, on the basis of weather forecasts and data measured in real time. The developed algorithms have been applied to a real case study: a portion of the Savona Campus (University of Genoa) polygeneration microgrid that includes a photovoltaic field, an electric storage system, a load, and a connection with the electric grid.",

      "abstract": "Microgrids (MGs) may represent a new answer to many old problems in energy and electric world, such as pollution, high reliability, efficiency and so on. The MG rapid increase implies a fast transformation of the electric power systems that are now characterized by new energy sources requiring dedicated control architectures and simulation tools. Unfortunately, the majority of such new sources are connected to the MG by means of power electronic converters that often make it impossible to replicate some of the concepts, tools and control philosophies commonly used in traditional networks. For this reason, there is a strong need of developing models for MG structures that can be reliable but sufficiently simple to be used for the control system design. In this framework, this paper presents a simplified first harmonic model for the Smart Polygeneration Microgrid (SPM) located in the Savona Campus of the University of Genoa that allows the interface with many controllers. The developed simplified model is validated comparing it with a complete simulation performed in the PSCAD-EMTDC environment that allows to represent each component with a high level of detail.",

The approach aims at finding the optimal mix and sizing of the generation units to be installed in a number of sites, given the characteristics of each location in terms of radiation, wind potential, electrical and thermal loads, etc. Both dispatchable and renewable (non-dispatchable) energy sources are taken into account; in particular, in the present application the sources considered for installation include cogeneration microturbines, photovoltaic plants and wind turbines. As both renewable sources and loads are stochastic in nature, a proper approach is used to evaluate the effects of the related uncertainties. The proposed model is applied to a neighborhood in Savona, Italy. The goal of the technique is to represent a tool for a decision maker when planning investments in different urban areas, in the context of the transition from a traditional city to a 'smart' one.",

The goal of the present paper is that of showing the main results of a performance analysis conducted on an 80.64 kW photovoltaic plant (PV1) connected to a low voltage (LV) smart microgrid in operation in the North of Italy. The experimental campaign lasted one year, from the beginning of December 2015 to the end of November 2016, and the collected data have been analyzed to evaluate some key performance indicators, among which there are the \"final yield\", the \"reference yield\", and the \"performance ratio\". Moreover, the performance of the plant has been compared with that of another photovoltaic plant (PV2) installed in the same site. The paper reports the main results of the aforementioned study and proposes some future research activities that could derive from it.",

      "abstract": "This paper develops a dynamic market mechanism (DMM) to optimally allocate electric and thermal power in a combined heat and power microgrid. The market is formulated as a receding horizon constrained optimization problem, from which an optimal automated transactive procedure is developed. The market operation is distributed in nature and incorporates the most up-to-date electric and thermal load estimates and renewable generation. These properties make our microgrid DMM, µDMM, attractive for microgrid energy management systems, as new smart buildings, battery storage systems, and renewable energy resources can be added in a plug-and-play fashion without reformulating the optimization problem and without adding computational complexity to the EMS. The result of the market clearing is the spot prices and set-points for electric and thermal power in addition to non-binding estimates of future prices and set-points. The the market mechanism is simulated on a CHP Microgrid model based on the Smart Polygeneration Microgrid (SPM) located on the University of Genoa's Savona campus.",

      "abstract": "The present paper proposes an Energy Management System (EMS) to be used in grid connected microgrids. To do this, first a suitable model (for optimization purposes) of all the components that typically appear in a microgrid is presented, then, four possible electric network models are detailed and finally the overall architecture of the optimization problem of the EMS is set up. Moreover, as the optimization of the energy production/consumption of a microgrid relies on the thermal and electric load and on the renewables forecasting, an online empirical correction of forecasted data is proposed, highlighting its positive impact on the overall operational cost of the microgrid. Another aspect which is accounted regards the possibility of allowing the EMS to act as a power plant controller in compliance with the Distribution System Operator (DSO) requirements in terms of reactive power management and voltage control (as requested by the majority of grid codes and national regulations). So, the proposed algorithm structure splits the optimization problem into two sub problems: the first one basically dictates the active power production of the dispatchable units minimizing an economic objective function, while the second accounts for the satisfaction of the DSO requirements. The experimental validation of the proposed EMS is performed on the University of Genoa Smart Polygeneration Microgrid (SPM), where the proposed EMS is currently running. The considered test cases highlight the effectiveness of the proposed EMS in economically operating the microgrid (compared to simpler EMS previously installed in the SPM) and in satisfying the reactive power or voltage regulation requirements provided by the Italian technical requirements.",

As far as the first aspect is concerned, the procedure is cyclically repeated at each time-step after that loads and renewable productions have been adjusted by means of real-time measurements. The economic aspects are performed by solving an optimization problem that minimizes the overall production cost and, therefore, it fixes the active power set point for all the programmable units. The Distribution System Operator (DSO) requirements in terms of active/reactive power management and voltage control, as requested by the majority of grid codes/standards, are satisfied (if possible) by tuning the reactive power of the programmable units.

      "abstract": "The paper aims at defining a methodology to evaluate the lightning performance of a system of overhead distribution lines. As is well known, the evaluation of the lightning performance relies generally on a Monte Carlo approach that generates many different lightning events and calculates the corresponding overvoltages. To perform such calculation, the power system computer aided design (PSCAD) module developed in the companion paper is adopted. However, as any call to PSCAD implies a nonnegligible computational effort, here an efficient approach is presented in order to limit the number of simulations as much as possible. The obtained results are compared with the ones provided by other available techniques both on simple structures in order to highlight the main features of the method and on a typical Italian distribution network segment. The comparative analysis shows good agreement between the methods and the effectiveness of the proposed technique in terms of computational effort reduction.",

First, the theoretical formulation of the problem in the time domain is presented. Then its numerical solution together with its implementation is described. Finally, a PSCAD-EMTDC interface and platform is developed, which allows us to model a realistic network, automatically distinguish between direct and indirect strokes and account for power network precontingency conditions. The obtained results are compared with a frequency-domain solution for a simple case in order to validate the finite-difference time-domain method adopted to solve the coupling equations and the interface with PSCAD. The comparison with the well-known LIOV code for a more complex case is used as a general validation of the overall tool. In a companion paper, the developed platform will be used to evaluate the lightning performance of a portion of the Italian MV distribution network.",

      "abstract": "The achievement of the so-called 2020 targets requested by the European Union (EU) has determined a significant growth of proposals of solutions and of technical projects aiming at reducing the CO<inf>2</inf> emissions and increasing the energy efficiency, as well as the penetration of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) in the electric network. As many of them ask for funding from the EU itself, there is the necessity to define a methodology to rank them and decide which projects should be sponsored to obtain the maximum effect on the EU 2020 targets. The present paper aims at (i) defining a set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to compare different proposals, (ii) proposing an analytical methodology to evaluate the defined KPIs and (iii) evaluating the maximum impact that the considered action is capable of producing. The proposed methodology is applied to a set of possible interventions performed on a benchmark transmission network test case, in order to show that the defined indicators can be either calculated or measured and that they are useful to rank different \"smarting actions\".",

      "abstract": "This paper focuses on the modeling of wind turbines equipped with direct drive permanent magnet synchronous generators for fundamental frequency power system simulations. Specifically, a procedure accounting for the system active power losses to initialize the simulation starting from the load flow results is proposed. Moreover, some analytical assessments are detailed on typical control schemes for fully rated wind turbine generators, thereby highlighting how active power losses play a fundamental role in the effectiveness of the wind generator control algorithm. Finally, the paper proposes analytical criteria to design the structure and the parameters of the regulators of the wind generator control scheme. Simulations performed with Digsilent Power Factory validated the proposed procedure, highlighting the impact of active power losses on the characterization of the initial steady state and that the simplifying assumptions done in order to synthesize the controllers are consistent with the complete modeling performed by the aforementioned power system simulator.",

      "abstract": "Electric mobility is assuming a central role in the new world energy scenario where Renewable Energy Sources (RES) have increased their contribution to the electricity production, mainly due to the fact they are characterized by a reduced environmental impact; in the aforesaid context, Electric Vehicles (EVs) can play a significant role to facilitate the integration of RES into the power grid, also within smart grid infrastructures. Public administration represents one of the sectors that can mostly benefit from the use of the EV technology in its fleets; in many countries, governments have introduced incentive policies to support the spread of the electric mobility and car manufacturers are developing EVs for urban transportation users. In this paper, the attention is focused on a smart microgrid project developed at the University of Genoa and based on the integration of RES, EVs and storage systems. In particular, the attention is here pointed on the use of the EVs to highlight the different habits of recharge adopted at the Genoa University. The paper describes the smart microgrid test-bed facility at the Savona Campus and reports the most significant results relative to an experimental campaign conducted on EVs.",

      "abstract": "Microturbines represent a suitable technology to be adopted in smart microgrids since they are characterized by affordable capital and maintenance costs, high reliability and flexibility, and low environmental impact; moreover, they can be fed by fossil fuels or biofuels. They can operate in cogeneration and trigeneration mode, thus permitting to attain high global efficiency values of the energy conversion system from primary energy to electrical and thermal energy; from the electrical point of view, microturbines can operate connected to the distribution grid but also in islanded mode, thus enabling their use in remote areas without electrification. The paper describes the mathematical model that has been developed to simulate in off-design and transient conditions the operation of a 65 kW<inf>el</inf>cogeneration microturbine installed within a smart microgrid. The dynamic simulation model is characterized by a flexible architecture that permits to simulate other different size single-shaft microturbines. The paper reports the main equations of the model, focusing on the architecture of the simulator and the microturbine control system; furthermore the most significant results derived from the validation phase are reported too, referring to the microturbine installed in the Smart Polygeneration Microgrid of the Savona Campus at the University of Genoa in Italy.",

      "abstract": "The estimation of the lightning performance of a power distribution network is of great importance to design its protection system against lightning. An accurate evaluation of the number of lightning events that can create dangerous overvoltages requires a huge computational effort, as it implies the adoption of a Monte Carlo procedure. Such a procedure consists of generating many different random lightning events and calculating the corresponding overvoltages. The paper proposes a methodology to deal with the problem in two computationally efficient ways: (i) finding out the minimum number of Monte Carlo runs that lead to reliable results; and (ii) setting up a procedure that bypasses the lightning field-to-line coupling problem for each Monte Carlo run. The proposed approach is shown to provide results consistent with existing approaches while exhibiting superior Central Processing Unit (CPU) time performances..",

In this paper, attention is focused on the integration of electric vehicles (EVs) in smart grids and, specifically, on an optimization-based architecture to minimize costs and including charging stations and electric vehicles. Two technologies have been considered in this work: the Smart Charging and the Vehicle to Grid (V2G). The aim of this paper is to investigate on the integration of electric vehicles in the smart grids and to prove that they can help in sustaining the grid processes when parked and so playing in costs minimization. The developed decision model is applied to the Savona Campus Smart Poly-generation Micro-grid (SPM) that is used in this case as an emulator of grids at the district level.

Specifically, the considered system is characterized by wind turbines, photovoltaic plants, cogeneration micro-turbines, boilers and a connection to the electrical grid. The input parameters of the available renewable resources, the electrical and thermal demands have been estimated on the basis of real data.

The microgrid shows different types of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) and is connected to the main grid through a fixed power bus. Due to the high computational speed, the applied distributed Optimal Power Flow can be performed almost in real time, i.e. every 5 minutes or less. The operating solution found for generators, simply using local information, corresponds to a suboptimal condition with reduced losses, bus voltages and line currents within constrained intervals. The distributed optimization algorithm is iterative, but also fast. It is based on the use of Kirchhoff and simplified power flow equations and heuristic rules and can be employed for islanded and grid connected medium or small networks. Test results on a real world test system, the Savona Campus \"Smart Polygeneration Microgrid\" (SPM), prove that a few iterations are enough to converge to a sub-optimal solution.",

      "abstract": "This paper is relevant to the important issue of planning and management of a so-called smart microgrid, namely a group of interconnected loads and distributed energy resources (DER) with clearly defined electrical boundaries that acts as a single controllable entity with respect to the public grid. The Energy Management System (EMS) plays a crucial role in governing the power flows coming from the different generating sources inside such infrastructure and can resort to optimization procedure and algorithms in order to minimize the daily operating costs. The main features of the EMS platform suitably developed to control the University of Genoa test-bed facility called Smart Polygeneration Microgrid (SPM) are here illustrated and thoroughly discussed.",

The analysis includes the evaluation of operational costs and CO<inf>2</inf> emissions, and is carried out in two steps: firstly, the quantification of the economic and environmental benefits provided by the SPM and the SEB on a yearly timescale is determined. Then, the same analysis has been done on a short-term horizon by the use of an optimization algorithm included in the SPM supervisory software. Such a model minimizes an objective function related to daily operational costs and includes the SPM electric and thermal power plants and loads, the distributed heating network, an active building (SEB) and the ICT system responsible for the operational management of the whole research infrastructures. The results of the analysis and the performed experimental research contribute to develop a set of Key Performances Indicators (KPIs) suitable for the smart microgrid concept deployment.",

For this purpose, an equivalent electric circuit is proposed together with an experimental procedure to evaluate its input parameters. The paper also highlights the simplicity of implementation of the proposed model into a microgrid Energy Management System. This allows the optimal operation of the thermal network to be achieved on the basis of available data (desired temperature profile) instead of a less realistic basis (such as the desired thermal power profile). The validation of the proposed model is performed on the Savona Campus Smart Polygeneration Microgrid (SPM) with the following steps: (i) identification of the parameters involved in the equivalent circuit (performed by minimizing the difference between the temperature profile, as calculated with the proposed model, and the measured one in a set of training days); (ii) test of the model accuracy on a set of testing days (comparing the measured temperature profiles with the calculated ones); (iii) implementation of the model into an Energy Management System in order to optimize the thermal generation starting from a desired temperature hourly profile.",

The quantities of inters are active and reactive power available at the POI in order to extrapolate the power plant capability starting from the capabilities of PWM inverters. The procedure also allows evaluating the POI voltage variations, an important element due to the increasing requirements for renewable generation units to participate in voltage regulation. The main interest in such a methodology lays in its simplicity of application, that allows avoiding the usage of dedicated software for load flow calculations, and flexibility, that makes it suitable for the support of the bidding and pre-design phase of large photovoltaic power plants.",

In this paper, two types of controllers are formalized and solved as optimal control problems: tertiary and secondary controls. For secondary control two different scaled single-phase models are used for the microgrid: one merely electric and the other one based on the synchronous machine. The approach is applied to a real test-bed facility: the University of Genova Smart Polygeneration Microgrid (SPM). Specifically, a portion of the microgrid is selected to study the behavior in islanded mode. The considered grid is characterized by: a diesel engine connected to an electrically excited synchronous generator, a photovoltaic plant and an electric storage (these last two are respectively connected to a couple of inverters set as current source generator (CSI)).",

The first step aims at performing an economical optimization, as it provides the active power set-point for the programmable units that minimizes the overall production cost. The second step is related to power quality issues (power factor correction or voltage support), as it produces in output the reactive power reference signal for all the devices under converter. Moreover, due to the presence of uncertainties in the electric and thermal load request and in the Renewable Energy Sources (RES) power production, an update forecasting logic is proposed that, applied at each time step of the optimization process, refines the forecast accuracy. The experimental validation performed on the SPM shows the efficacy of the proposed EMS in satisfying both the economic and the power quality objectives.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This paper proposes a methodology for the equivalent modeling of large photovoltaic power plants at the Point of Interconnection with the transmission/distribution network. The interest in such a methodology lays in the fact that recently Transmission/Distribution System Operators (TSOs/DSOs) have extended the requirements for the connection of renewable generation to their electricity networks beyond the only supply of active power, requiring ancillary services too. It is then a primary necessity for the Companies which operate in the market of large photovoltaic plants to have a simple but effective tool to verify the compliance of a proposed plant layout with specific TSO requirements (which vary from country to country) in order to support the bidding and preliminary design phase of the project. After an overview of the typical layout of large photovoltaic plants, the proposed methodology is fully described. In order to verify its reliability, the method is validated against exact load flow calculations on a test case photovoltaic plant layout. In the light of the good results achieved by the methodology validation, the last part of the paper proposes an application to infer the power plant capability and the compliance check with reference to specific TSOs requirements.",

The electric grid is a three phase low voltage distribution system, connecting many different technologies: three cogeneration micro gas turbines fed by natural gas, a photovoltaic field, three cogeneration Concentrating Solar Powered (CSP) systems (equipped with Stirling engines), an absorption chiller equipped with a storage tank, two types of electrical storage based on batteries technology (long term Na-Ni and short term Li-Ion ion), two electric vehicles charging stations, other electrical devices (inverters and smart metering systems), etc. The EMS can be used both for microgrids approximated as single bus bar (or one node) and for microgrids in which all buses are taken into account. The optimal operation of the microgrid is based on a central controller that receives forecasts and data from a SCADA system and that can schedule all dispatchable plants in the day ahead or in real time through an approach based on Model Predictive Control (MPC).

      "abstract": "The aim of this paper is the definition of an equivalent two-port model of a transmission line that is able to take into account high frequency radiation effects. Such a model is particularly useful when one has to represent the line into a more complex power system, modeled in a lumped way. To reach this goal, it is necessary to produce a reliable and computationally effective solution to the problem of the high-frequency electromagnetic field coupling with a terminated transmission line. From a mathematical standpoint, this problem can be presented by means of an integral equation whose solution can be achieved with regularization procedures for linear inverse problems. In order to obtain a computationally efficient result, the unknown current is first developed in a Fourier series and then the Landweber iterative algorithm is applied to identify the series coefficients. The proposed method is then tested taking as reference the numerical results obtained using the Numerical Electromagnetics Code (NEC-2), reaching a good agreement.",

      "abstract": "The evaluation of the indirect lightning performance of an overhead power line is typically represented by means of curves reporting how many lightning faults per year the line may experience as a function of its insulation level, and so it expresses the probability that the line is subject to an overvoltage greater than its critical flashover voltage (CFO). Obtaining this curve is a very time-consuming task from a computational point of view, since the evaluation of the lightning overvoltage requires the solution of the field-to-line coupling problem and this has to be repeated a significant number of times, taking into account the possible values assumed by all the stochastic variables that influence the process. In this contribution, some mathematical properties of the probability density functions (PDF) are exploited in order to derive a formula in which the probability that an overvoltage caused by an indirect lightning event is greater than an assigned value can be computed simply by a numerical evaluation of an integral. The results have been compared with those obtained applying a classical Monte Carlo technique, showing an excellent agreement between the two approaches with a considerable CPU time reduction.",

Such microgrid is designed to produce electric and thermal energy by means of renewable generation units, cogenerative gas turbines, a storage unit and electric vehicle charging stations. The work focuses its attention on the issue of the microgrid day-ahead power production optimization. Such problem consists in finding the power production profiles for all the dispatchable units in order to optimize a well-defined goal (economical, environmental, etc). This requires to model all the components of the grid in order to define the set of constraints for the optimization procedure. In particular, the way of representing the electric power balance equations plays a crucial role since a trade-off between accuracy and computational efforts is required. Different approaches are presented and tested on the SPM, e.g. complete load flow, modified DC load flow and single bus-bar representation, in order to highlight the peculiarity of the different optimization models obtained and evaluate their impact on computational time, result accuracy and possibility of future experimental validation.",

Specifically, a multilevel architecture is introduced and evaluated for the following main purposes: to reduce the computational complexity, to deal with different decentralized microgrids, different decision makers, and multiple objectives. A two-level decision architecture based on a Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme is presented, in which the upper decision level has the function of fixing the values of a certain set of parameters (reference values), by assuming a certain structure of the control strategies to be applied at the lower decision level. On the basis of such parameters, each decision maker at the lower level solves its own optimization problem by tracking the reference values provided by the upper level. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated. The application of the proposed control architecture to a specific case study (Savona, Italy) is presented and discussed. © 2014 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The strong increase in the number of installed photovoltaic (PV) production plants has slowly changed the assets and the operating conditions of the electricity power system. In this context, the supply and control of the reactive power from the renewable generation plants are becoming an important issue to be exploited that can facilitate the integration of PV and wind power in electricity grids. The aim of this paper is to propose an optimized control strategy to manage the reactive power resource generated by PV plants in order to improve the quality of the low/medium voltage distribution network and meet the latest technical requirements listed by distribution system operators in their grid codes. A methodology to define the optimal reactive power references for each PV unit connected to a generic distribution network is presented for a specified goal (e.g., the achievement of suitable voltage levels at the grid nodes). Such reference signals are then provided to the PV plants regulation systems, which are designed in order to guarantee the decoupling between the active and reactive power channels, due to the use of the Feedback Linearization control technique. The problem is formulated in a generalized way, so that it can be extended to any possible grid configuration. © 2013 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, as set by the EU 20-20-20 targets, the reduction of primary energy use and greenhouse gas emissions in the energy sector can be attained by increasing the use of renewable sources and improving energy efficiency. Many national and international research programs are aiming at developing innovative technologies and new energy management strategies in order to reach the targets set out in the 20-20-20 directive. In this context, a primary role is played by the Distributed Generation (DG), which refers to the electrical and thermal generation located near to the place of use, exploiting available renewable sources. One of the best way to exploit the emerging potential of DG is to take a system approach which views generation and associated loads as a whole concept called microgrid. The sources can operate in parallel to the grid or can operate in island, providing utility power station services. Utilization of waste heat from the sources will increase total efficiency, making the polygeneration microgrid more financially attractive and smart from the energy consumption standpoint. The smartness is also in the management system, where control strategies aiming at the optimization of technical, economical and environmental issues are typically implemented. This paper deals with smart microgrids, addressing basically the following topics: (1) to review methods, models, tools, technologies and research challenges in the specific field; (2) to present the University of Genoa Smart Polygeneration Microgrid (SPM), built with the financial contribution of the Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research at the decentralized Savona Campus facilities. The SPM produces energy at low emissions for the University and operates as a test-bed facility for research, testing and development of smart grid components. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

      "abstract": "The increased penetration of renewable energy sources and the concept of a dynamic and highly distributed Smart Grid which can intelligently integrate production units, storage systems and connected users opened new challenges in the application of optimization techniques. In this work, a dynamic optimization problem is formulated on a power grid characterized by wind and photovoltaic production units, conventional power plants, biomass co-generation and storage systems. A Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme is adopted in the dynamic decision model for real time purposes. The decision problem takes into account the network load flows constraints and a state equation related to the state of charge (SOC) of the batteries. Different issues (economic, technical, environmental, security) have been taken into account for the formalization of the objective function.

The aim of the present work is to introduce an innovative optimized control strategy to exploit the reactive power resource generated by photovoltaic plants in order to improve the quality and efficiency of the low/medium voltage distribution network. Here, a methodology to define the optimal reactive power reference for every photovoltaic unit of the network is presented in order to pursue a well-defined goal, such as the minimization of the Joule losses or the voltage support. Such reference signals are then provided to the photovoltaic control systems that will guarantee the decoupling between the reactive power channel and the active power one, thanks to the use of the FeedBack Linearization (FBL) control technique.

The use of such method makes it possible to face both measurement and parametric uncertainties, since it has been developed and is widely used to solve inverse problems that are typically ill-posed.

      "abstract": "This article proposes an advanced non-linear control algorithm to manage active power and voltage provided by a synchronous generator. The algorithm is based on the so-called feedback linearization theory, which relies on the central concept to algebraically transform non-linear systems dynamics into fully or partly linear ones, so that linear control techniques can be applied. Starting from the basic (electrical, magnetic, and mechanical) machine equations, a suitable state transformation is introduced in order to apply the feedback linearization block to the generator model. A regulation scheme is then derived, which receives as inputs the measure and reference signals of both the electric power and the voltage at the generator side and produces as outputs the physical inputs of the machine, i.e., the mechanical torque and the field voltage. Particular attention is devoted to both the linearization process, where internal dynamics and stability studies play an important role, and to the design of the two (power and voltage) decoupled regulators. Several simulations are finally performed in order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach and to highlight its main advantages and drawbacks with respect to the traditional P-V synchronous generator control strategy. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a model for the analysis of internal faults of synchronous generators with multiple parallel connection paths for phase. Several kinds of faults between different portions of the stator windings (and ground, if the case) can be described in the subtransient time frame. Data necessary for the model derive from the electromagnetic design of the machine, as well as from details on equivalent parameters of the external grid and from the neutral connection characteristics. Such modeling procedure allows accurate insight of currents in windings and terminals, exploring each possible fault configuration.

      "abstract": "This study proposes a new control scheme to manage active and reactive power injections into the distribution grids provided by photovoltaic (PV) generating units. Such scheme is derived by resorting to the so-called 'feedback linearisation' theory, which relies on the central concept to algebraically transform non-linear systems dynamics into fully or partly linear ones, so that linear control techniques can be applied. To do this, a suitable state transformation is required, in order to simplify the form of the power system to be controlled. The developed scheme receives as input the reference signal for the PV unit voltage (generated by a maximum power point tracker controller) and the one for the desired reactive power and produces as output the modulating signal of the grid interface pulse width modulation inverter. A detailed simulation campaign on a medium voltage grid connected PV power plant is performed in the PSCAD-EMTDC electromagnetic environment, in order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm and to highlight its main advantages with respect to traditional regulation methodologies. © 2012 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, a new representation for the lightning channel base current is proposed in terms of the so-called Prony series, obtained by means of a modified time-domain variant of the well-known vector fitting technique. This method allows both to reproduce in an equivalent way previous analytical representations such as Heidlers function and, more interestingly, to obtain a smooth analytical interpolation of measured raw data, in an automatic though tunable way, without the need of filtering, and taking into account the desired behavior of the current for t 0. Furthermore, a Prony series, i.e., a representation in terms of a sum of exponentials and/or dumped sinusoids, permits us to carry out the computation of the integrals expressing the lightning electromagnetic fields by means of a recursive convolution algorithm, thus reducing the required CPU time. This makes the proposed approach extremely useful for studies of lightning performance of distribution lines, which require the simulation of an appreciable number of cases. © 2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "This paper focuses on the development of a control strategy for integration of wind energy conversion systems (WECS) into the electrical distribution networks with particular attention to the combined provision of energy and ancillary services. Typically, a WECS is composed by a variable speed wind turbine coupled with a direct driven permanent magnet (DDPM) synchronous generator. This configuration offers a considerable flexibility in design and operation of the power unit, as its output is delivered to the grid through a fully controlled frequency converter. Here, a new control scheme to regulate electrical and mechanical quantities of such generation unit is proposed, aimed both at reaching optimal performances in terms of power delivered to the grid and at providing the voltage support ancillary service at the point of common coupling. The control scheme is derived resorting to the feedback linearization (FBL) technique, which allows both decoupling and linearization of a non linear multiple input multiple output system. Several numerical simulations are then performed in order to show how the flexibility of the DDPM wind generator can be fully exploited, thanks to the use of the FBL approach, which assures independent control of each variable and significant simplifications in controller synthesis and system operation, thus making it easier to integrate WECS into modern day smart grids. © 2011 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "This paper is focused on the evaluation of the benefits (environmental/technical) expected from the improvement of transmission and distribution infrastructures with the introduction of specific state-of-the-art technologies. This issue is presently much debated both at industrial and at scientific level, since worldwide measures are taken to lower the environmental impact of energy supply systems, in particular with regard to climate change [1 - 3]. Grids can be renewed by resorting basically to six interventions: 1. Replacement/refurbishment of power components; 2. Wide area measurement, monitoring and control systems (WAMS/WACS), upgrading protection and control devices for communication; 3. Increase of voltage level; 4. Installation of power quality devices (Distribution Networks); 5. High voltage direct current transmission systems - HVDC (line and forced commutated); 6. Flexible AC transmission systems - FACTS (Transmission Networks). In this work, the attention is concentrated on the application of FACTS to modern networks and the quantification of their impact on the achievement of the EU energy targets for the year 2020 [4], including improved efficiency, improved renewable generation penetration and improved environmental compatibility (basically linked to CO<inf>2</inf>emissions reduction). Our attention will focus on the use of FACTS devices and the installation of newer and more efficient components. We won't deal with the problem of increasing the rate voltage as the proposed model for the network is in \"per unit\", so it is valid for every voltage level. Three main scenarios are investigated: in the first one, the aim is to find an optimal condition of the power system, in which the insertion of FACTS can contribute to increase the overall efficiency; in the second one, the capability of FACTS to enable the integration of a certain amount of power generated via renewable resources into a grid operating in a critical asset (transmission lines at their capacity limits) is analyzed; in the third one, the optimization of the generating scheduling of different power plants connected to the grid to obtain an optimum power set-points configuration for each unit from an environmental point of view is discussed. In this last analysis scenario, one has to characterize the different power plants emissions and relate them with the power produced, then generate the set-points with an 'environmental oriented' dispatching procedure and employ FACTS to reach the desired configuration.",

In particular, the FeedBack Linearization (FBL) technique and the Sliding Mode (SM) method have been applied to regulate voltage and electric power. To do this, the basic equations of the generator have been re-formulated into the so-called normal form and, next, a proper state transformation and a suitable control law have been defined. Starting from this form, the SM algorithm has then been used in order to take into account possible model and parametric uncertainties.

      "abstract": "In the first part of this paper, the rigorous theory describing the electromagnetic field radiated by a lightning return stroke over a two-layered conducting ground was presented and the exact expressions for the lightning electromagnetic fields were developed and discussed. In this part of the paper, the theory along with its time domain numerical evaluation algorithm is used for the assessment of the validity of simplified approaches proposed in the literature for the vertical electric and horizontal magnetic field components. The simplified approaches are based on the concept of ground surface impedance and its corresponding attenuation function. It is shown that the results obtained using the simplified approaches are in excellent agreement with exact results in both near (50 m) and intermediate (1000 m) distance range. However, since the vertical electric and azimuthal magnetic field components are not appreciably affected by the ground finite conductivity, they can also be evaluated assuming the ground as a perfectly conducting ground. On the other hand, the horizontal electric field above a horizontally stratified ground is very much affected by the ground electrical parameters. Its waveform is characterized by an early negative excursion due to the currents flowing into the ground followed by a late time positive excursion which is due to the elevation of the observation point from the ground level. The magnitude of the negative peak is sharper for subsequent return strokes than first return strokes and is higher for lower conducting grounds. A new formula is proposed for the evaluation of the horizontal electric field at a given height above the air-ground interface. The formula can be viewed as the generalization of the Cooray-Rubinstein formula for the case of a two-layer ground. We show that the new formula is able to reproduce in a satisfactory manner the horizontal electric field above a two-layer ground. The proposed formulation is, however, less accurate at distances as close to 10 m from the channel base and for very poor ground conductivity (0.0001 S/m).

      "abstract": "The formulation describing the electromagnetic field radiated by a lightning return stroke over a two-layered conducting ground is presented in this paper. The derivation of the Green's functions required to solve the problem is first discussed in detail, and the expressions for the lightning electromagnetic fields are determined. Afterward, an efficient method for the numerical evaluation of the electromagnetic field is proposed. The proposed method is based on a suitable modification of a previously developed model for the evaluation of the fields in the presence of a lossy but homogeneous soil. Particular attention is devoted to the soil reflection coefficient properties, both from a physical and from a mathematical point of view. In part 2 of the paper, the developed approach and numerical algorithms will be used to evaluate the effect of the soil stratification on the radiated fields and to perform the validity assessment of simplified approaches proposed in the literature.

This configuration offers a considerable flexibility in design and operation, as the output of the generator is delivered to the grid through a fully controlled frequency converter. In this paper, a new control strategy for this generation unit is presented, based on the Feed Back Linearization (FBL), a technique that allows both decoupling and linearization of a non linear multiple input multiple output (MIMO) system. The mathematical model for the control synthesis is derived, and simulation results are presented in order to show how the flexibility of the DDPM Wind Generator can be fully exploited thanks to the independent control of each variable performed with our approach. Moreover, both controller synthesis and system operation can be greatly simplified, thus making it easier to integrate this wind energy conversion system (WECS) in modern day smart grids.",

      "abstract": "PhotoVoltaic (PV) generation units are more and more used in order to have a local production cutting down the use of conventional fuels and providing reactive support to the supply. Such gridconnected systems fix mandatory constraints to power electronic converters to meet power quality specifications and draw the maximum power conversion from renewable sources. This paper deals with the possibility to employ a grid-connected PV production unit not only as an active power supply but also as an ancillary service provider [1-2]. In a recent paper [3], an advanced control scheme has been proposed in order to control P and Q power flows injected by the PV unit, which can therefore support reactive power compensation. Here, the aim is to develop a modelling approach which allows us to define a sort of capability curve for the PV unit, i.e. the set of points in the P-Q plane which, at steady state, can be reached by properly operating the control system and without exceeding the physical limits of all the involved devices. Basic algorithms are developed in the MATLAB environment and rely on a simplified description of the system, which neglects the harmonics injected by the VSC inverter. Starting form real data of PV units, analytical expressions have been derived for their characteristic [4] in the plane I-V, best fitting the experimental points. Afterwards, the developed model is used to evaluate all the possible working points in the P-Q chart; Finally, simulations with the electromagnetic code PSCAD-EMTDC [5], which allows representing with high detail all the components, are performed in order to assess the validity of the approximate results. The advantage of the approximate model is that with very low computational cost (less than 1 minute) it is possible to completely characterise a PV unit in terms of possible P and Q injections, being confident that such working points maintain stability properties during dynamic performances. © CIGRE2009.",

      "abstract": "PhotoVoltaic (PV) generation units are more and more used in order to have a local production cutting down the use of conventional fuels and providing reactive support to the supply. Such gridconnected systems fix mandatory constraints to power electronic converters to meet power quality specifications and draw the maximum power conversion from renewable sources. This paper deals with the possibility to employ a grid-connected PV production unit not only as an active power supply but also as an ancillary service provider [1-2]. In a recent paper [3], an advanced control scheme has been proposed in order to control P and Q power flows injected by the PV unit, which can therefore support reactive power compensation. Here, the aim is to develop a modelling approach which allows us to define a sort of capability curve for the PV unit, i.e. the set of points in the P-Q plane which, at steady state, can be reached by properly operating the control system and without exceeding the physical limits of all the involved devices. Basic algorithms are developed in the MATLAB environment and rely on a simplified description of the system, which neglects the harmonics injected by the VSC inverter. Starting form real data of PV units, analytical expressions have been derived for their characteristic [4] in the plane I-V, best fitting the experimental points. Afterwards, the developed model is used to evaluate all the possible working points in the P-Q chart; Finally, simulations with the electromagnetic code PSCAD-EMTDC [5], which allows representing with high detail all the components, are performed in order to assess the validity of the approximate results. The advantage of the approximate model is that with very low computational cost (less than 1 minute) it is possible to completely characterise a PV unit in terms of possible P and Q injections, being confident that such working points maintain stability properties during dynamic performances. © CIGRE2009.",

      "abstract": "This paper is aimed at analyzing the influence of the frequency-dependent behavior of the ground electrical parameters (conductivity and ground permittivity) on the electromagnetic field radiated by a cloud-to-ground lightning return stroke. Both radiation in air (over the conducting ground plane) and underground are considered in the analysis. The adopted method is based on the classical Sommerfeld's theory and takes advantage of an efficient ad hoc numerical procedure to face with the slow converging Sommerfeld's integrals. This feature allows the electromagnetic field to be computed without any sort of mathematical approximation and, since it is carried out in the frequency domain, can be used either if the ground permittivity and conductivity are considered constant or if they vary with the working frequency with any functional law. Simulations have been performed to identify the cases in which the approximation of constant ground permittivity and conductivity leads to satisfactory results. It is shown that for soils with water contents of 2% to 10% (ground conductivities in the order of 0.001 to 0.01 S/m), the assumption of constant electrical parameters appears to be reasonable. However, for either very poorly conducting soils (10<sup>-4</sup> S/m or so) or highly conducting soils (10<sup>-1</sup> S/m), the electromagnetic field components appear to be significantly affected by the frequency dependence of the ground electrical parameters.

A method for the numerical evaluation of the electromagnetic field is then proposed, and it is shown that it can be used starting from any \"engineering model\" representation for the lightning current distribution along the channel. Such method is based on a new efficient evaluation of the so-called Sommerfeld's integrals appearing in the electromagnetic field expressions, without resorting to any kind of approximated formulas for them.

This formula provides a simple method to evaluate the radial component of the electric field which is the component most affected by the finite ground conductivity and which plays an important role within the Agrawal et al. (1980) field-to-transmission line-coupling model. Several configurations are examined, with different values for the ground conductivity and different field observation points. A thorough analysis of all the simulated field components is carried out and comparisons are also made with the \"ideal\" field, namely, the field that would be present under the assumption of perfectly conducting ground. It is shown that for channel base current typical of subsequent strokes and for very low conductivities, the CR formula exhibits some deviations from the reference one but it still represents a conservative estimation of the radial field component, since it behaves as un upper bound for the exact curve. The developed algorithm is characterized by fast performances in terms of CPU time, lending itself to be used for several applications, including a coupling code for lightning induced overvoltages calculations.

For this reason, a great effort has been devoted in the derivation of approximate formulas that can provide accurate results with low computational costs.

      "abstract": "The number of power installations lying underground has been increasing in the last few years, and such devices are very sensitive to the effect of the lightning electromagnetic fields, due to the massive presence of power electronics. As a consequence, the scientific community has devoted much effort in the direction of a more accurate modeling of underground lightning fields and their coupling to cables. The exact expressions of the underground lightning fields have been derived by Sommerfeld decades ago. However, their numerical evaluation has always been a hard task because of the presence of slowly converging improper integrals. In the past, some approximate formulas have been derived, which have been included in field-to-transmission line coupling models to estimate the effect of lightning on buried cables. In this paper, an efficient algorithm for the evaluation of the Sommerfeld expression for underground fields is presented, and its mathematical features are discussed. The numerical treatment of the Sommerfeld integrals is based on a proper subdivision of the integration domain, the application of the Romberg technique, and the definition of a suitable upper bound for the error due to the integral truncation. The remarkable efficiency in terms of CPU time of the developed algorithm makes it possible to use it directly in field-to-buried cable coupling simulation codes. Finally, the developed algorithm is used to test the validity of the Cooray's simplified formula for the computation of underground horizontal electric field. It is shown that predictions of the Cooray's formula are in good agreement with exact solutions for large values of ground conductivity (0.01.S/m). However, for poor conductivities (0.001 S/m or so), Cooray's expression yields less satisfactory results, especially for the late time response. © 2007 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "This paper deals with the evaluation of lightning electromagnetic fields inside a finitely conducting ground. We present a comparison between three different approaches that have been adopted by researchers dealing with lightning electromagnetic effects. The first is the Cooray Formula in which, the equations of lightning generated electromagnetic fields below the ground surface are connected to surface fields that can easily be determined. The second approach recently proposed by Delfino et al. consists of numerically evaluating the exact field expressions. Finally, the third approach is based on a numerical solution of Maxwell's equations using the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method. Two different values for the ground conductivity, namely 0.01 S/m and 0.001 S/m are considered in the computations. The adopted model for the return stroke is the Modified Transmission Line model with Exponential decay (MTLE). The results obtained using Delfino et al. algorithm and those obtained using FDTD are virtually identical. It is also shown that the Cooray formula is able to reproduce with a very good accuracy the underground fields, especially for their earlytime response. ©2007 IEEE.",

This is useful to create an elementary block that can be used to evaluate with a high accuracy the propagation of high-frequency electromagnetic waves in real urban environment. Design/methodology/approach - The approach is based on a realistic application of the asymptotic theory of the uniform theory of diffraction. Therefore, the effect of material roughness and its electromagnetic properties on the reflection are taken into account. Findings - Provides information about the mechanisms involved in electromagnetic field propagation in urban environment, and the relative importance of each one. Research limitations/implications - In urban environment the buildings obviously have finite dimensions. The diffraction equations examined in the paper are strictly valid only in the case of infinite wedges; therefore, the behaviour of real building edges has not been taken rigorously into account. Practical implications - A source of information for researchers interested in the development of a simulator for the electromagnetic propagation in urban environment. Originality/value - This paper is aimed at providing to researchers, in a more comprehensive way, all information needed for the study of electromagnetic propagation in an environment containing many close scatterers. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",

It is shown that the problem can be reduced to the solution of a convolution type integrodifferential equation system and an effective and accurate procedure to cope with this is described. The procedure first appfies the convolution theorem to the initial integrodifferential equation system to obtain an algebraic one in terms of the Fourier coefficient of the original unknown function. Next, this new system is diagonalised and reduced to a set of decoupled equations. These are then solved by means of an ad hoc developed algorithm, essentially based on a representation of the Fourier coefficient in terms of the Neumann series. The proposed approach is applied to a two-conductor test line and the obtained numerical results for different conductors radius values are compared with those provided by the classical infinite-length-conductor approximation. © IEE, 2004.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we present a new formulation for the evaluation of the electromagnetic field levels in the near zone of a cellular radio base-station collinear array antenna. The algorithm allows to determine the real current distribution along each half-wave dipole forming the array for a given exciting function and it enables to take into account the effects of mutual coupling among array elements. Once the antenna current distribution has been determined, the radiated field in the near zone is reconstructed using the integro-differential equation relating field and current. The developed algorithm, tested respectively on a 4-element and S-element collinear array antenna operating at 900 MHz, allows to accurately analyze the response of dipole arrays with a computational cost significantly lower than that of a classical method of moments.",

      "abstract": "One of the most significant lightning-related quantities is the return stroke current, which is defined as the spatial and temporal distribution of the lightning current after the contact between the leader of the discharge and the ground is established. Gaining information about the return stroke current is of prime importance for the general investigation into the lightning physics as well as for the determination of the correct expression of the electromagnetic field associated with the phenomenon. In this paper we propose an inverse procedure for the reconstruction of the proper waveform of the return stroke current, starting from the measurement of the vertical component of the electric field it produces at different locations on the ground and making use of the integral equation expressing the link between field and current. The ground is assumed to be conductive, and the general Sommerfeld's theory for the vertical antenna radiation over a lossy half-space is adopted for the calculation of the field. It is shown that the unknown current distribution along the channel can be identified if it is suitably expanded by means of a modified basis of Chebyshev polynomials. The proposed approach is validated by means of the numerical simulation of the classical MTLE (Modified Transmission Line Exponential) engineering model, and an analysis on the role played by ground conductivity in the identification process is carried out.",

Such assumptions determine restrictions on the maximum value of line height and width with respect both to the line length and to the minimum field wavelength.

      "abstract": "A novel finite-element method (FEM) floating-conductor formulation for the numerical electromagnetic analysis of electrostatic microactuators is presented and discussed in this paper. It is based on the assumption that the moving part of the microdevice can be modeled as a perfect conductor and leads to a considerable reduction of the mesh size, as the region occupied by the moving part does not need to be discretized at all. It is also shown that the developed formulation can be easily coupled with the well-known method of equivalent charges for the computation of the driving torque acting upon the rotor of the microdevice. This coupling is performed directly in terms of variables involved in the solution process of the final algebraic system and it allows acquiring torque information without any postprocessing operation. The proposed approach has been applied to the analysis of an electrostatic micromotor with radial field. When compared to simulations obtained with a commercial FEM electromagnetic code using a classical high-permittivity formulation, this method proves to be accurate and exhibits an overall reduction of preprocessing, processing and postprocessing time.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, it is shown that the problem of the electromagnetic field coupling to a line of finite length can be put into \"a standard form\" of dual integral equations. A general method for solving such dual integral equations is presented and discussed. It basically consists of a transformation of the first kind Fredholm equation into a linear system of algebraic equations by means of a suitable Neumann expansion of the unknown function. This procedure, carried out in the frequency domain, has allowed evaluating the current induced on the line, which has also been computed with the classical method of moment in order to have a validation of the procedure itself.",

It is based only on the acquisition of the electromagnetic field radiated by the discharge channel in various locations on the ground and at various frequencies, and requires no information about the channel base current. The fundamental idea is shown to come from an electrostatic problem in which the linear charge density of a vertical thin wire is determined starting from the measured field. Three versions of this procedure have been developed: in the first, the identification is carried out by means of the measurement of the electric field at various distances from the lightning channel at a given frequency; in the second, only two sensors for the electric field are necessary, but various sampling frequencies; in the third, only one observation point is needed, for the measurement of both the electric and the magnetic field. A simulated validation of all the approaches is provided as well as a detailed analysis of their numerical accuracy.",

This procedure, basically founded on the solution of the integral equation expressing the link between field and current and derived under the assumption of perfectly conducting ground, is here extended to include the case of a lossy ground. The general Sommerfeld's theory for the vertical antenna radiation over a conducting half-space is adopted for the calculation of the lightning field and a numerical validation of the proposed method by means of simulated data is provided.

      "abstract": "The evaluation of the total force of magnetic origin acting upon a body in a stationary magnetic field is often carried out using the so-called magnetic energy (or co-energy) method, which is based on the derivation of the magnetic energy (or co-energy) with respect to a virtual rigid displacement of the considered body. The application of this method is usually justified by resorting to the energy conservation principle written in terms both of electrical and of mechanical quantities. In this paper we shall re-examine the whole matter in the context of classical thermodynamics, in order to obtain a more comprehensive and general proof of the validity of the energy (or co-energy) approach and to point out its limitations. Two typical configurations will be discussed; in the first one, the field sources are represented by conducting bodies carrying free currents, whereas in the second one a permanent magnet creates the driving field. All magnetic materials are assumed to be non-hysteretic and permanent magnets are represented by means of the well-known linear model in the second quadrant of the (B,H) plane.",

In the past, several formulae for the evaluation of the shielding efficiency were proposed. This paper is aimed at the comparison of their results with the Finite Element Method, in order to assess their range of applicability. Evidence is given that expressions determined for planar and cylindrical shields of infinite structure can be suitably used to estimate the shielding efficiency of more realistic shaped shields.",

A nodal two-scalar potential formulation and a mixed face-edge formulation are used to solve the field problem and to derive force values, which are then compared to analytical results. The numerical accuracy of the proposed methods, in connection both to the used formulation and to the level of refinement of the mesh, is analyzed and discussed. It is shown that results coming from the mixed solution are more accurate than those obtained with the nodal one.",
