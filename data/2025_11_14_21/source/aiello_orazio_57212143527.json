      "abstract": "This paper deals with a standard cell-based analog-in-concept pW-power building block as a comparator and a wake-up oscillator. Both topologies, traditionally conceived as an analog building block made by a custom process and supply voltage-dependent design flow, are designed only by using digital gates, enabling them to be automated and fully synthesizable. This further results in supply voltage scalability and regulator-less operation, allowing direct powering by an energy harvester without additional ancillary circuit blocks (such as current and voltage sources). In particular, the circuit similarities in implementing a rail-to-rail dynamic voltage comparator and a relaxation oscillator using only digital gates are discussed. The building blocks previously reported in the literature by the author will be described, and the common root of their design will be highlighted.",

      "abstract": "A low-effort, tiny, low-power, inverter-based Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) is proposed in this paper. Based on a Voltage-to-Time Converter (VTC), the architecture requires a minimum design adjustment of the core block to let it work across supply voltages down to 0.3 V. The operation is based on charging and discharging of a timing capacitor, which enables a square wave from a digital counter to be converted from voltage to pulse width as a function of the input voltage signal. In turn, the duty cycle makes counting an additional digital counter driven by a feasible ring oscillator. Post-layout simulations of the designed solution, which relies on TSMC 180 nm standard CMOS technology, show a Si area of 7200 µm<sup>2</sup>, a 6.8 ENOB, a power consumption of 409 nW, and a sample rate of 5 kS/s. These ADC's extremely low voltage and low power features make it appropriate for energy-harvested Systems-on-Chips (SoCs) in biomedical and Internet of Things (IoT) applications.",

The proposed filter features orthogonal tunability of the center frequency (ω<inf>0</inf>) and quality factor (Q). To achieve ultra-low power consumption, all transistors are biased in the subthreshold region with a supply voltage of 0.5 V. A Nauta inverter-based gm block is utilized as the operational transconductance amplifier (OTA), further enhancing power efficiency. The filter is capable of generating all filtering responses across a supply voltage ranges from 1.2 V down to 0.5 V. Moreover, the center frequency and quality factor can be tuned by adjusting capacitance values. The proposed Gm-C filter achieves a power consumption of 48 nW, with the center frequency ranging from 50.6 Hz to 1270 Hz.",

      "abstract": "This letter reports on the design of a novel, fully integrated stand-alone light-to-digital converter (LDC) for optoelectronic sensors in wearable/implantable biomedical applications. The architecture designed in TSMC 180 nm standard Si CMOS technology integrates a Si photodiode (PD), a ring oscillator, two digital counters, and a voltage-to-pulsewidth modulation (PWM) stage as the basic block of the light-to-digital converter in a Si area of 0.018 mm<sup>2</sup>. The modulation stage, composed of ten transistors and a capacitor, provides a square waveform whose pulse width varies as a function of its input voltage provided by the Si photodiode operating in a photovoltaic mode that linearly depends on the light intensity impinging on its sensitive area. The value of the pulse width is digitalized by two digital counters driven by the ring oscillator. The complete system, powered at 0.3 V, has been fully characterized by postlayout simulations demonstrating an overall sensitivity of 0.062 LSB/lx, a power consumption of 335 nW, and a sample rate of 3 kS/s. A comparison with similar solutions in the literature shows that the proposed system achieves the best performance in power consumption, Si area, and supply voltage with a good sample rate value.",

Both solutions are implemented using 180nm CMOS standard process technology and validated through experimental results. Both the OTAs maintain compact size (typical of a digital-based architecture), enhanced average slew rate, S Ra v, performance, and, hence, improved large-signal power efficiency (high FOML). The proposed ICT solution exploits forward-body biasing and composite transistor architecture to improve the differential voltage gain compared to the RTA implementation of the same OTA. Operations from a supply voltage, VDD, ranging from 0.5 V to 0.3 V are demonstrated in this work. In particular, the proposed reference-less inverter-based ICT OTA achieves a differential voltage gain of 50 dB(35 dB) and 17 kHz (0.3 kHz) gain-bandwidth product, G B W, at 0.5 V(0.3 V), while driving 30-pF capacitive load.

      "abstract": "A crucial part of treating neurological disorders like Parkinson’s and epilepsy involves using Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) systems. This paper describes a system that provides stimulation through a multipolar biphasic current source. It consists of two identical instances, one for each cerebral hemisphere, each containing five stimulators: four of them are locally connected, while the fifth is connected to an implantable pulse generator for monopolar stimulation. Each stimulator can deliver a maximum current of 12 mA with 9-bit resolution and offers passive charge balancing. Safety features include a DC blocking capacitor for electrical isolation, ensuring minimal DC current flow in case of system failure. The proposed design compensates for up to ±50% mismatch in stimulation current sinks by utilizing current sources, thereby distributing current errors in ideal proportions. The stimulator’s voltage can be adjusted up to 30V. Based on post-layout Monte Carlo simulations, the common-mode voltage variates from its nominal value only by a standard deviation σ equal to 2 mV. Thus, referring to an overall 3σ variation, the proposed topology shows a 4× improvement in anchoring the brain voltage compared to the state-of-the-art. This architecture enables concurrent recording and stimulation, minimizing the artifacts generated by stimulation.",

It is based on a square-wave relaxation oscillator that incorporates both pulsewidth modulation (PWM) and proportional to magnitude (PM) dependencies. The circuit is designed to interface with differential capacitance sensors but can also interface with single-capacitance sensors using a reference capacitor. It works with various capacitive values, ranging from a few nanofarads to less than one picofarad, considering different external R<inf>0</inf> resistor values. Characterization tests proved that the fabricated chips exhibit the expected performance across the full range of use, achieving a sensitivity of 207 μs/ΔpF in the differential mode (110 μs/pF in the single mode) and a resolution of 0.5 fF in the differential mode ((0.9 fF in the single mode). The circuit occupies a silicon area of 0.0044mm<sup>2</sup>, with a maximum power consumption of 1.5 mW. The circuit has also been successfully tested in real applications, such as measuring liquid levels in microfluidic applications. By using COTS level-meters, it achieved a sensitivity of 0.4 pF/mL with a resolution of 100 μL. Measuring the dielectric constant in liquids was also demonstrated by using specifically designed 3-D-printed fluidic capacitance sensors.",

The proposed amplifier architecture leverages the principles of the conventional DIG-OTA while incorporating an inverter-based common-mode feedback (CMFB) loop and an inverter-based output stage. Designed using TSMC's 180 nm CMOS process, the proposed architecture achieves a gain of 49dB, a gain-bandwidth product of about 3.72 kHz, and a phase margin of 55 degrees, with an output load capacitance of only 5 pF that can be integrated on-chip. The CMFB mechanism implemented here ensures a commendable common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR), as high as 65 dB, which remains stable across process, supply voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations. Additionally, the power consumption of the proposed OTA is remarkably low at just 0.62 nW. All of these characteristics put the proposed OTA at the state-of-the-art of ULV OTAs.",

      "abstract": "Neural recording systems play a crucial role in comprehending the intricacies of the brain and advancing treatments for neurological disorders. Within these systems, the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) serves as a fundamental component, converting the electrical signals from the brain into digital data that can be further processed and analyzed by computing units. This research introduces a novel nonlinear ADC designed specifically for spike sorting in biomedical applications. Employing MOSFET varactors and voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs), this ADC exploits the nonlinear capacitance properties of MOSFET varactors, achieving a parabolic quantization function that digitizes the noise with low resolution and the spikes with high resolution, effectively suppressing the background noise present in biomedical signals. This research aims to develop a reconfigurable, nonlinear voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO)-based ADC, specifically designed for implantable neural recording systems used in neuroprosthetics and brain–machine interfaces. The proposed design enhances the signal-to-noise ratio and reduces power consumption, making it more efficient for real-time neural data processing. By improving the performance and energy efficiency of these devices, the research contributes to the development of more reliable medical technologies for monitoring and treating neurological disorders. The quantization step of the ADC spans from 44.8 mV in the low-amplitude range to 1.4 mV in the high-amplitude range. The circuit was designed and simulated utilizing a 180 nm CMOS process; however, no physical prototype has been fabricated at this stage. Post-layout simulations confirm the expected performance. Occupying a silicon area is 0.09 mm<sup>2</sup>. Operating at a sampling frequency of 16 kS/s and a supply voltage of 1 volt, this ADC consumes 62.4 µW.",

The analyzed circuit is composed of standard cells only so that the design flow can be automated, and based on its digital nature, it enables a supply voltage scaling down to deep sub-threshold. The specifications of the same topology are investigated with post-layout simulations under different technology nodes such as 180nm, 130nm, and 40nm and across scaled supply voltage ranging from 0.9 down to 0.3 V.

Thanks to adaptive voltage scaling and body biasing, the proposed circuits show robustness to the effect of the process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations. In particular, post-layout simulations referring to 180 nm technology process show a supply voltage insensitivity in the range from 6 V down to 2.5 V. The possibility of being robust to uncertain and unreliable supply voltage changes suppresses the need for an additional voltage reference and makes the proposed circuits well-suited for energy-harvesting systems-on-chip.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, a low-design effort, compact analog-to-digital converter (ADC) based on pulse-width modulation with a high level of digital (highly synthesizable) building block is described. Thus, the topology can take advantage of exploiting digital design tools offering supply-voltage scalability although relying on minimum re-design of the core block. The operating principle is based on the charge and discharge of a timing capacitor that allows an input-voltage-to-duty-cycle conversion. The duty cycle, in turn, enables the count of a counter exited by a ring oscillator. Post-layout time-domain simulations of the ADC performed at 180nm show a power consumption of 494 nW with a sample rate of 5 kS/s, 5.6 ENOB at 0.4 V supply voltage, and a compact area of 7200 μm<sup>2</sup>. The very low power consumption makes the proposed circuits very well suited for energy-harvested systems-on-chip for Internet of Things applications.",

      "abstract": "Batteryless energy harvesting IoT sensor nodes such as beat sensors can be deployed in millions without the need to replace batteries. They are ultra-low-power and cost-effective wireless sensor nodes without the maintenance cost and can work for 24 hours/365 days. However, they were not equipped with security mechanisms to protect user data. Data encryption and authentication can be used to secure beat sensor applications, but generating a secure cryptographic key is challenging. In this paper, we proposed an SRAM-based Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) combining a high-reliability bit selection algorithm with a lightweight error-correcting code to generate reliable secure keys for data encryption. The system employs a feature of beat sensors, in which the microcontroller is powered on to transmit the ID signals and then powered off. This fits the SRAM-based PUF requirement, which needs the SRAM to be powered off to read out its random values. The proposed system has been evaluated on STM32 Cortex M0+ micro controllers and has been implemented to protect important data on beat sensors.",

The CDC used in this work operates at nW power and low voltage down to 0.3 V without the need for any additional circuitry, references, or voltage regulation. It is built on swappable oscillators and takes advantage of the delay-power flexibility of dual-mode logic. Its self-calibration corrects PVT changes and mismatches at any point in the chip lifecycle, doing away with the necessity for cutting during testing. A CDC’s test chip in 180 nm demonstrates that its power consumption can be dynamically modified from 1.37 nW down to 418 pW at a conversion time down to hundreds of ms, making it suited for harvesting systems with a very tight power budget and changing power sources.",

In order to optimize the system performance and to increase the comfort of people living or working in a building, it is necessary to monitor the relevant parameters of the circulating air flux. To this end, an array of sensors (i.e., temperature, humidity, and CO<inf>2</inf> percentage sensors) is usually deployed along the aeraulic ducts and/or in various rooms. Generally, these sensors are powered by wires or batteries, but both methods have some drawbacks. In this paper, a possible solution to these drawbacks is proposed.

This is achieved by using improved composite transistors (ICT) with safe forward-body-biasing, so the amplifier can be used with typical I/O supply voltages and high-VT thick-oxide transistors without significant parasitic substrate current. Two versions of the same OTA were designed and simulated using the open-source Skywater 130 nm PDK. The first version, made of only trapezoidal transistor arrays, achieves an 84 dB voltage gain, 1.33 MHz GBW, and 60 <sup>∘</sup> phase margin for a 10 pF capacitive load while demanding 122μW of power at 3.0 V power supply. The proposed ICT OTA version attains about the same specifications, except for its voltage gain, which has increased by 33 dB, thus reaching 121 dB.",

      "abstract": "In this work, a capacitance-to-digital converter (CDC) suitable for direct energy harvesting is introduced. The nW peak power and the ability to operate at any supply voltage in the 0.3-1.8 V range allow complete suppression of any intermediate DC-DC conversion, and hence direct supply provision from the harvester, as demonstrated with a mm-scale solar cell. The proposed CDC architecture eliminates the need for any additional support circuitry, preserving true nW-power operation, and reducing design and integration effort. In detail, the architecture is based on a pair of double-swappable oscillators, and avoids the need for any voltage/current/frequency reference circuit in the oscillator mismatch compensation. The digital and differential nature of the architecture counteracts the effect of process/voltage/temperature variations. A load-agnostic one-time self-calibration scheme compensates mismatch, and can be run from boot to run stage of the chip lifecycle. The proposed self-calibration scheme suppresses any trimming or testing time for low-cost systems, and avoids any input capacitance disconnection requirement. A 180-nm testchip shows 7-bit ENOB down to 0.3 V and 1.37-nW total power, when powered by a 1-mm2 indoor solar cell down to 10 lux (i.e., late twilight).",

      "abstract": "Neural recording systems are essential for understanding the brain and developing treatments for neurological disorders. Analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is among the required building blocks of neural recording systems, as they convert the brain's electrical signals into digital data that can be processed and analyzed by processing units. In this paper, a new nonlinear A D C for spike sorting in biomedical applications has been introduced. The A D C is implemented with MOSFET varactors and voltage-controlled oscillators (VCO). By exploiting the nonlinear capacitance characteristics of MOSFET varactors, the ADC has a parabolic quantization function to suppress background noise in biomedical signals. Furthermore, nonlinear digitization gives an effective resolution that is almost 0.11 bit more than its physical number of bits. The resolution of neural signals can vary from 3.1 bits in the low amplitude range to 9.11 bits in the high amplitude range. The circuit was designed and simulated using a 180 ~nm CMOS process, taking up 0.102 ~mm2 of silicon area. While operating at the sampling frequency of 25 kS / s and a supply voltage of 1 Volt, this ADC dissipates 62.4 μ W.",

      "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation systems which consist of recording, stimulation, and detection functions play a key role in the treatment of neurological disorders such as Parkinson's, Epilepsy, etc. In this paper, a multipolar biphasic current stimulation system is presented. The system includes 5 stimulators on each side of the brain, four of which are connected locally in the brain, and the fifth is connected to the body of the implantable pulse generator for monopolar stimulation. This stimulator can also be used as a voltage stimulator. The maximum current that can be supplied by the stimulator is 12.75 mA, with 8-bit resolution. Passive charge balancing is used, and due to safety concerns, a DC blocking capacitor is used for electrical isolation and negligible DC current flow even at system failure. In the proposed architecture, the mismatch among the total stimulation current sinks can be compensated up to ±45% by current sources, and the current errors are distributed with the ideal ratio of the adjusted currents. The stimulator voltage can be varied up to 30V. The efficiency of this stimulator at the mid-high load is 55% without considering the digital control core.",

A control voltage generated by a feedback circuit allows to estimate the values of the duty-cycles of the input and output clock signals. This control voltage provides and regulates the values of two currents that charge and discharge, even asymmetrically, a load to adjust the output clock signal duty-cycle. The DCC circuit has been designed in TSMC 180 nm CMOS technology with a 1.8 V single supply voltage and requires a total Si area of about 0.017 mm<sup>2</sup> with a power consumption of 0.46 mW/GHz. The reported post-layout simulations validated the DCC circuit performances to suitable correct the input clock signal duty-cycle for values ranging from 30 % to 70 % so providing a 50 % duty-cycle of the output clock signal with an error smaller than ±1 %. Furthermore, the proposed simple DCC circuit handles input clock waveforms with frequencies ranging from 3 GHz down to 30 kHz. This makes the DDC circuit suitable for a variety of applications such as clock generators, transceivers, serial interfaces, Phase-Locked Loop, Delay-Locked Loop, RAM memories, and data links.",

      "abstract": "The performance of PVDF pyroelectric films for electrical power production has been improved by adding very small amounts of nanostructured ZnO prepared by sol-gel method which is a cheap, simple, and easy method. The XRD spectrum of the prepared ZnO indicates that it is a nanostructure. Pyroelectric films are prepared from PVDF and different percentages of prepared nano ZnO. The Pyroelectric coefficient, Dielectric Constant, and Conductivity of prepared films are measured to be used as inputs for the mathematical model that is created to obtain the optimal percentage of added nano ZnO to PVDF, determine the optimal thickness of the pyroelectric film, and study the effect of the film surface area on energy harvesting performance. It is found that the addition of nano ZnO to PVDF pyroelectric film has two effects on energy harvesting: positive and negative. The positive effect is an increasing pyroelectric coefficient, but the negative effect is an increasing dielectric constant. So the optimal percentage of adding nano ZnO is defined. The optimal value of the thickness of PVDF film, which has an optimal added ZnO percentage, is determined. The reduced surface area of the pyroelectric film increases energy conversion efficiency.",

      "abstract": "Owing to the geographically scattered end devices (EDs) in long-range wide area networks (LoRaWAN), devices that combat challenging cyber threats and attacks are of critical significance. In this perspective, LoRa Alliance® is continuously evolving the security of LoRaWAN and recently introduced a new version i.e., LoRaWAN 1.1x that is featured with security improvement. However, the wireless nature of LoRaWAN implementation still leaves it vulnerable to security breaches that compromise its integrity. Several problems have been pinpointed in the newer version such as one issue with key distribution in LoRaWAN 1.1 is that the keys are often pre-installed on the devices at the time of manufacturing. It can introduce security risks if the keys are not adequately protected or if the devices are compromised before they are deployed. In other words, the pre-installed keys may not be updated regularly, which can also introduce security risks. Thus, the keys need to be handled securely to maintain the security of the network and the over-the-air firmware updates feature could introduce new security challenges for the key distribution. This paper presents a key generation and distribution (KGD) mechanism that securely exchanges the root key between the ED and the application server (AS). The KGD protocol provides authentication by integrating Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-128) in addition to a secure hash function known as Argon2. The proposed protocol utilizes Elliptic-Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchange method that makes the protocol resilient to cyber threats. The ECDH algorithm exchanges the keys on the insecure channels and is, therefore, vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks in the network. Therefore, to validate the key agreement and avoid adversaries, the KGD protocol considers the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) that authenticates and allows legitimate instances in the network. In last, a formal security analysis using the Scyther tool validates the security enhancement of the KGD protocol.",

The CDC in this work leverages the delay-power flexibility of dual-mode logic, is based on swappable oscillators and operates at nW power and low voltage down to 0.3 V without requiring any additional circuitry, reference or voltage regulation. Its self-calibration compensates PVT variations and mismatch at any point of the chip lifecycle, eliminating the need for trimming at testing time. Testchip demonstration of the CDC in 180nm shows that its power consumption can be dynamically adjusted from 1.37 nW down to 418 pW at a conversion time down to hundreds of ms. This makes the CDC suitable for harvested systems with very limited tight power budget and fluctuating voltage.",

Both directly benefit from the reduction in the complexity of MAC units (neurons), thanks to the reduction in area and energy of computations and the interconnect fabric. Unfortunately, such area and energy cost per neuron further increases in practical cases where flexibility is needed (e.g., precision scaling), ultimately limiting cost and power reductions. In this work, the all-digital DDPMnet architecture for DNN acceleration based on a pulse density data representation is introduced to reduce the gate count/MAC unit from the thousand range to few hundreds (Fig. 1). The proposed architecture removes any arithmetic block from MAC units (e.g., multipliers), while retaining the advantages of standard cell based design.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, a new technique for improvement on the DC voltage gain, while keeping the high-linearity in symmetrical operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) bulk-driven (BD) topology is proposed. These features are achieved by allying two topological solutions: enhanced forward-body-biasing self-cascode current mirror, and source degeneration. The proposed concept is demonstrated through simulations with typical process parameters and Monte Carlo analysis on nominal transistors of the CMOS TSMC 180 nm node. Results indicate that the proposed OTA can achieve a very small transconductance, only 542 pA/V while keeping a voltage gain higher than 60 dB, 150 dB CMRR, and high linearity of 475 mVpp (1% THD), consuming only 1.9 nW for a supply voltage of 0.6 V. This set of features allows the proposed OTA to be an attractive solution for implementing OTA-C filters for the analog front-ends in wearable devices and bio-sensing.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, passive-less fully-digital operational transconductance amplifiers (DIGOTA) for energy- and area-constrained systems are modeled and analyzed from a design viewpoint. The digital behavior of DIGOTAs is modeled as an equivalent small-signal differential-mode circuit with zero bias current, and a common-mode feedback loop operating as a self-oscillating threshold sampler. Such continuous-time equivalent circuits are used to derive an explicit model of the main performance parameters that are generally adopted to characterize OTAs. This provides an insight into circuit operation and allows to derive practical guidelines to achieve a given design target. Among the others, an explicit model is derived for the DC gain, the frequency response, the gain-bandwidth product, the input-referred noise, and the input offset voltage. The models are validated via direct comparison with multi-die measurement results in CMOS 180 nm. From an application viewpoint, the voltage (power) reduction down to 0.25 V (subnW) uniquely enable direct harvesting (e.g., with solar cells), suppressing any intermediate DC-DC conversion stage. This further enhances the area efficiency advantage of DIGOTA stemming from its fully-digital nature, making it well suited for cost-sensitive and purely-harvested systems.",

The DB-OTA is designed using digital standard cells, hence benefitting from technology scaling as much as digital circuits, while also being technology- and design-portable, and requiring minimal design and integration effort compared to conventional analog-intensive OTAs. The fabricated DB-OTA testchip occupies a compact area of 1,426 \\mu \\text{m}^{2} , operates at supply voltages down to 300 mV, and consumes only 590 pW while driving a capacitive load of 80pF. Its measured Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) is lower than 5% at a 100-mV input signal swing. Based on these results, the proposed DB-OTA achieves 2,101 V-1 small-signal figure of merit (FOMS) and 1,070 large-signal figure of merit (FOML). To the best of the authors' knowledge, the power is the lowest reported to date in an OTA, and the achieved figures of merit are the best in sub-500 mV OTAs reported to date. The low cost, the low design effort and the high power efficiency of DB-OTA make it well suited for purely harvested low-frequency analog interfaces in sensor nodes.",

Thanks to its digital nature, the comparator can be designed and integrated with fully-automated digital design flows and can operate at very low voltages down to deep sub-threshold. Measurements on an 180nm testchip show correct operation under rail-to-rail common-mode input at a supply voltage ranging from 0.6V down to 0.15V. The comparator delay (power) is lower than 442 μs (10pW) at 0.15-V supply voltage. The input offset voltage is less than 30mV over the entire rail-to-rail common-mode input and supply range. The minimum supply voltage and power are the lowest reported to date, and make the circuit suitable for direct powering from mm-scale harvesters.",

      "abstract": "In low-cost battery-less systems, capacitive sensing via capacitance-to-digital conversion (CDC) needs to operate with minimal or no support from additional circuitry such as voltage regulation, voltage/current references or digital post-processing as shown in Fig. 5.2.1 (e.g., for linearization). At the same time, direct harvesting demands operation down to very low voltages and power, to consistently fit the power available from the environment even when scarce (e.g., down to \\sim \\mathrm{nW} / \\mathrm{mm}^{2} in light harvesters under realistic conditions). To enable continuous monitoring at power lower than the μW-range of state-of-the-art \\sim 12 -bit CDCs [1-3], 7 -to-8-bit architectures with power down to sub-nW have been demonstrated for sensor nodes [4], although their supply voltage requirement (\\geq 0.6 \\mathrm{~V}) is not suitable for direct harvesting, similar to [5]. CDCs for continuous monitoring at lower resolution (\\sim 7 bit) with sub-nW operation at 0.6 \\mathrm{~V} have been also demonstrated [6], although their power is burdened by the additional contribution of digital post-processing (\\sim n W s) and others. A fully digital CDC has been introduced in [7] in the form of capacitance-to-voltage conversion via capacitor linear discharge due to a ring oscillator and final voltage-to-digital conversion, which requires two supply voltages of 0.45 \\mathrm{~V} and 1 \\mathrm{~V}. Operation at minimal power also comes with measurement times in the sub-second or second scale [6,8] in addition to the reduced resolution, which are still in the range required by continuous monitoring in several applications [6,8] (e.g., temperature, humidity, proximity, fluid level monitoring).",

      "abstract": "The paper deals with the immunity to Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) of the current source for Ultra-Low-Voltage Integrated Circuits (ICs). Based on the properties of IC building blocks, such as the current-splitter and current correlator, a novel current generator is conceived. The proposed solution is suitable to provide currents to ICs operating in the sub-threshold region even in the presence of an electromagnetic polluted environment. The immunity to EMI of the proposed solution is compared with that of a conventional current mirror and evaluated by analytic means and with reference to the 180 nm CMOS technology process. The analysis highlights how the proposed solution generates currents down to nano-ampere intrinsically robust to the Radio Frequency (RF) interference affecting the input of the current generator, differently to what happens to the output current of a conventional mirror under the same conditions.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes topological enhancements to increase voltage gain of ultra-low-voltage (ULV) inverter-based OTAs. The two proposed improvements rely on adoption of composite transistors and forward-body-biasing. The impact of the proposed techniques on performance figures is demonstrated through simulations of two OTAs. The first OTA achieves a 39 dB voltage gain, with a power consumption of 600 pW and an active area of 447 µm<sup>2</sup>. The latter allies the forward-body-bias approach with the benefit of the independently biased composite transistors. By combining both solutions, voltage gain is raised to 51 dB, consuming less power (500 pW) at the cost of an increased area of 727 µm<sup>2</sup>. The validation has been performed through post-layout simulations with the Cadence Analog Design Environment and the TSMC 180 nm design kit, with the supply voltage ranging from 0.3 V to 0.6 V.",

A fully automated test bench evaluates the nanoampere range DC offset currents in a realistic and comprehensive scenario by using platinum electrodes in a saline solution as a load for the stimulator. Measurements are performed on different stimulation patterns for single or dual hexagonal stimulation sites operating simultaneously and alternately. The effectiveness of the return electrode presence in reducing the DC offset current is considered. Experimental results show how for a defined nominal injected charge, the generated DC offset currents differ depending on the stimulation patterns, frequency, current amplitude, and pulse width of a biphasic signal.",

The proposed fully-digital ADC architectures enable low-effort design, silicon area reduction, and voltage scaling down to the near-threshold region. Compared to traditional analog-intensive designs, their digital nature allows easy technology and design porting, digital-like area shrinking across CMOS technology generations, and also drastically reduced system integration effort through immersed-in-logic ADC design. The voltage-input ADC architecture is demonstrated with a 40-nm testchip showing 3,000-μm<sup>2</sup> area, 6.4-bit ENOB, 2.8kS/s sampling rate, 40.4dB SNDR, 49.7dB SFDR, and 3.1 μW power at 1V. A current-input ADC is also demonstrated for direct current readout without requiring a trans-resistance stage. 40-nm testchip measurements show a 5-nA to 1-μA input range, 4, 970 μm<sup>2</sup> area, 6.7-bit ENOB and 2.2-kS/s sample rate, at 0.94-μW power. Compared to the state of the art, the proposed ADC architecture exhibits the highest level of design automation (standard cell), lowest area, and the unique ability to cover direct acquisition of both voltage and current inputs, suppressing the need for transresistance amplifier in current readout.",

Based on a digital standard cell approach, the proposed DAC allows very low design effort and enables digital-like shrinkage across CMOS generations, low area at down-scaled technologies, and operation down to near-threshold voltages. The proposed DAC can operate at supply voltages that are significantly lower and/or at clock frequencies that are significantly greater than the intended design point, at the expense of moderate resolution degradation. In a 12-bit 40nm testchip, graceful degradation of 0.3 bit/100 mV is achieved when V<inf>DD</inf> is over-scaled down to 0.8 V, and 1.4 bit/100 mV when further scaled down to 0.6 V. The proposed DAC enables dynamic power-resolution tradeoff with three times (two times) power saving for 1-bit resolution degradation at iso-sample rate (iso-resolution). A 12-bit DAC testchip designed with a fully automated standard cell flow in 40 nm consumes 55 μW at 27 kS/s (9.1 μW at 13.5 kS/s) at a compact area of 500 μm<sup>2</sup> and low voltage of 0.55 V.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, a pW-power relaxation oscillator for sensor node applications is presented. The proposed oscillator operates over a wide supply voltage range from nominal down to deep sub-threshold and requires only a sub-pF capacitor for Hz-range output frequency. A true pW-power operation is enabled thanks to the adoption of an architecture leveraging transistor operation in super-cutoff, the elimination of voltage regulation, and current reference. Indeed, the oscillator can be powered directly from highly variable voltage sources (e.g., harvesters and batteries over their whole charge/discharge cycle). This is achieved thanks to the wide supply voltage range, the low voltage sensitivity of the output frequency and the current drawn from the supply. A test chip of the proposed oscillator in 180 nm exhibits a nominal frequency of approximately 4 Hz, a supply voltage range from 1.8 V down to 0.3 V with 10%/V supply sensitivity, 8-18-pA current absorption, and 4%/°C thermal drift from -20 °C to 40 °C at an area of 1600μ\\mathrm m<sup>2</sup>. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the proposed oscillator is the only one able to operate from sub-threshold to nominal voltage.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, very compact, standard cell-based Digital-to-Analog converters (DACs) based on the Dyadic Digital Pulse Modulation (DDPM) are presented. As fundamental contribution, an optimal sampling condition is analytically derived to enhance DDPM conversion with inherent suppression of spurious harmonics. Operation under such optimal condition is experimentally demonstrated to assure resolution up to 16 bits, with 9.4-239X area reduction compared to prior art. The digital nature of the circuits also allows extremely low design effort in the order of 10 man-hours, portability across CMOS generations, and operation at the lowest supply voltage reported to date. The limitations of DDPM converters, the benefits of the optimal sampling condition and digital calibration were explored through the optimized design and the experimental characterization of two DACs with moderate and high resolution. The first is a general-purpose DAC for baseband signals achieving 12-bit (11.6 ENOB) resolution at 110kS/s sample rate and consuming 50.8μ W, the second is a DAC for DC calibration achieving 16-bit resolution with 3.1-LSB INL, 2.5-LSB DNL, 45μ W power, at only 530μ m<sup>2</sup> area.",

The proposed circuits are based on standard cells utilizing the Dynamic Leakage Suppression logic style [4]-[5]. The proposed oscillators exhibit low supply voltage sensitivity over a wide supply voltage range, from nominal voltage down to the deep sub-threshold region (i.e., 0.3 V). This enables direct powering from energy harvesters or batteries through their whole discharge cycle, suppressing the need for voltage regulation. Post-layout time-domain simulations of the proposed oscillators in 180nm show a power consumption of 1.4-1.7pW, a supply-sensitivity of 55-40%/V over the 0.3V-1.8V supply voltage range, and a compact area down to 1,500µm<sup>2</sup>.

Integrated smart-power circuits enable innovative solutions moving toward a system integration. The combination of analog, digital, and power building blocks on a single chip allows the design and production of less-volume-and-weight electronics systems for different applications in the several fields. Smart-power ICs are usually employed in the automotive industry, where higher safety standards, tighter environmental normative, and the demand for increasing comfort on board lead to a constantly increasing amount of microelectronic components built into modern cars [1]. Therefore, high performance has to be guaranteed with the highest level of reliability and critical parameters have to be detected, and proper countermeasures have to be taken immediately. Thus, for safety reasons, specific integrated sensors are designed to report status signals to the central unit and to protect the overall system-on-chip. It means that monitoring and sensing building blocks have to work properly in every operating condition in order to prevent malfunctioning or damaging of the overall integrated system-on-chip.",

      "abstract": "This paper deals with the susceptibility to RF interference of a temperature sensor used in smart power system-on-chip to shut down the source of heat or the overall device in the case of overtemperature. Such a sensor is usually buried within the power section; hence, it is parasitically coupled with the power transistors and for this reason its operation can be affected by the disturbances superimposed onto the power transistors nominal signals. In this work, the detrimental effect of the RF interference on a common thermal shutdown circuit is analyzed using an approximate nonlinear model and performing time-domain computer simulations. The results of these analyses show that RF interference can induce false fault signaling. To avoid this, a simple and effective layout solution that improves the immunity of such kind of circuits is proposed and its effectiveness is proved by experimental test results. © 2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "In this work a biologically-inspired network of spiking neurons is used for robot navigation control. The two tasks taken into account are obstacle avoidance and landmark-based navigation. The system learns the correlation among unconditioned stimuli (pre-wired sensors) and conditioned stimuli (high level sensors) through Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP). In order to improve the robot behaviours not only the synaptic weight but also the synaptic delay is subject to learning. Modulating the synaptic delay the robot is able to store the landmark position, like in a short time memory, and to use this information to smooth the turning actions prolonging the landmark effects also when it is no more visible. Simulations are carried out in a dynamic simulation environment and the robotic system considered is a cockroach-inspired hexapod robot. The locomotion signals are generated by a Central Pattern Generator and the spiking network is devoted to control the heading of the robot acting on the amplitude of the leg steps. Several scenarios have been proposed, for instance a T-shaped labyrinth, used in laboratory experiments with mice to demonstrate classical and operant conditioning, has been considered. Finally the proposed adaptive navigation control structure can be extended in a modular way to include other features detected by new sensors included in the correlation-based learning process.",
