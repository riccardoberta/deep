      "abstract": "First introduced in European directives and recently incorporated into the Italian legal framework, Renewable Energy Communities (RECs) are described as innovative organisations that can promote collaboration between active and passive users engaged in the production, sharing and consumption of locally produced energy, according to creative management schemes. The aim of this study is the implementation of Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) models to build Energy Management Systems (EMSs) for an aggregator managing a REC. The REC includes Renewable Energy Sources (RESs), Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs), AC and DC charging points for Electric Vehicles (EVs), and also considers the use of Vehicle-to-Building (V2B). Specifically, the “Centralised” EMS managed by the aggregator has the aim of maximising the energy shared within the REC, while minimising BESS and EV battery degradation. The optimal profiles of active power exchanges with the network are provided as reference inputs to the local EMSs of the users. Two scenarios are considered, a week in May and a week in December, to investigate the impact of different RES productions and electricity demands on energy sharing mechanisms. Through the definition of appropriate Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), this work shows that an optimal operation of the distributed energy technologies can improve the REC performance, leading to Shared Energy Index (SEI) up to 92.42% for the considered week of May. Further scenarios are investigated considering mid-season weeks (March and October) and analysing the trade-off between maximising the shared energy and minimising battery degradation of BESSs and EVs. Finally, the impact of the users’ cooperative or non-cooperative behaviour on the global energy sharing is investigated through the analysis of multiple scenarios, varying the centralised EMS awareness about REC members’ behaviour and the configuration in terms of cooperative/non-cooperative users.",

      "abstract": "The transportation sector is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. To address this, the European Union is promoting the integration of Electric Vehicle (EV) charging infrastructures with Renewable Energy Sources (RESs). The intermittency of RESs can be mitigated through the use of Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs) and advanced EV charging strategies such as Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G), which require effective energy management. Accurate implementation of RES inverter capability curves is essential to minimize discrepancies between theoretical models and real-world performance. This study presents an Energy Management System (EMS) based on a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model to optimize overnight charging of electric trucks at an Electric Vehicle Charging Hub (EVCH) powered by RESs. The EMS is developed in Matlab/Yalmip and solved using Gurobi. The model is applied to a real EVCH connected to a large-scale wind farm in Liguria, Italy, with integration of Photovoltaic (PV) and BESS units. Validation is performed through comparison with HOMER Grid simulations. Several sensitivity analyses are conducted, varying RES availability, truck presence, and electricity prices, to assess EVCH performance. Results show that V2G enables a 13.3 % cost reduction compared to constant-power charging. If the BESS is out of service, the increase in facility net costs is limited to 3.6 %. However, if trucks are available during the day, the V2G benefit is nullified due to overlap with RES production peaks. Conversely, higher electricity prices lead to a 6.7 % increase in the V2G contribution.",

      "abstract": "The transition towards electric mobility is being promoted by the European Union as a countermeasure to the greenhouse gas emissions in road transportation. Consequently, the adoption of electric vehicle fleets for freight movement and last-mile deliveries is in progress: this transition is viable if sufficient electric charging infrastructures are available within their operating routes. However, allocation of chargers at city centres may pose problems related to congestions in the power distribution network during peak hours, along with possible peaks in renewable energy sources production. This paper presents a mathematical programming formulation for the optimal allocation and sizing of an electric vehicle charging infrastructure within an urban area in which a fleet of electric vehicles for freight delivery operates. The considered urban area is divided into peripheral and internal zones, with the former able to host depots and large electric vehicle charging hubs and the latter hosting smaller electric vehicle charging areas. The optimization problem, formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming problem, aims to allocate and size the photovoltaic units, the battery energy storage systems and the electric vehicle chargers to be installed in each zone, depending on local requirements, while allowing the electric vehicle fleet to satisfy the predefined logistic demand in the considered zones. The model is applied to a delivery fleet operating in the city of Milan, Italy, considering various scenarios and making some sensitivity analyses for evaluating the impact of economic parameters on the optimal configuration of the facility. The results show that photovoltaic units are a viable solution towards sustainable logistics, while the installation of battery energy storage systems is not always favorable. Quick alternating current chargers and vehicle-to-grid chargers are generally preferable, while fast direct current chargers are economically viable only under certain conditions.",

The EMS includes models for the power electronics units to apply reactive power management and a generic formulation for the management of the startup and shutdown cycles of dispatchable units. Furthermore, a detailed modeling of BESS and DG units is presented, reflecting the actual behavior of the devices. The MG is modeled as a multi-busbar network, with the application of the power flow equations to establish the link between power flows and nodal voltages. All the constraints are linearized to formulate the EMS as a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) optimization problem. The EMS is validated in a real facility: the CATEPS Microgrid Living-Lab. The results demonstrate the operational effectiveness of the EMS in different seasons, exhibiting a reduction in costs ranging from 21.84 % in summer to a 5.69 % in winter compared to a scenario with RES production but without energy management. In addition, a comprehensive examination of reactive power and voltage management is presented. Furthermore, an empirical assessment of the power flow equations linearization demonstrated minimal discrepancy in the results when compared with those obtained with the non-linear equations, exhibiting a mean absolute error of 8.8e-5 p.u. and 3.2e-5 rad in voltage magnitude and phase angle, respectively, in the most unfavorable scenario. A sensitivity analysis of the startup and shutdown cycles management of the BESS reveals a negligible effect on operational costs, yet it provides a mechanism for managing the battery stress by reducing the number of startups in a complete week from 28 to 16 in summer and from 37 to 24 in winter. The dependence between the maximum charging and discharging power on the state of charge of the BESS is also assessed in the use case.",

      "abstract": "Warehouse operations are increasingly scrutinised for their contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. The adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs), renewable energy sources, and Energy Storage Systems (ESS) represents an energy-efficient strategy to reduce the environmental impact of warehouses. In this context, designing an Energy Management System (EMS) is crucial to optimising energy use and enhancing sustainability. This paper proposes a novel framework that jointly schedules daily warehouse operations (including sequencing of storage and retrieval tasks, assigning tasks to fuel-based vehicles or EVs, and vehicle routing) and manages energy flows among photovoltaic panels, ESS, power grid, and EV charging station. A Mixed Integer Linear Programming model is proposed to address this integrated planning problem. Computational experiments in realistic situations under sunny and cloudy weather conditions demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed formulation. The results highlight the importance of integrating renewables, EMS, and warehouse operations to reduce costs and support sustainable warehouse operations. Moreover, a very fast matheuristic algorithm is proposed to efficiently solve large and real-scale instances. Dedicated experiments on a real case study confirm the capability of the approach to deliver fast and high-quality solutions in industrial case scenarios.",

In this paper, an Italian mechanical workshop involved in mechanical production, has been studied. The electrical loads were monitored and analyzed over a period of four years and an energy model was developed to determine the electrical consumption of heat pumps used for the air conditioning of the building. The annual electricity production of a PV system installed on the roof was also analyzed. The annual trends were compared in order to assess the benefits achievable through the installation of a storage system. In the overall scenario of the company's electrification, an optimization model was also developed to determine the benefits to be gained from the implementation of electric mobility infrastructures: the optimal size of batteries and the number of EVs charging stations were determined based on the economic analysis.",

      "abstract": "As a highly efficient and stable energy storage battery, NaNiCl<inf>2</inf> can resist over-discharge to a certain extent, but frequent over-discharge will still lead to irreversible capacity decay. Therefore, accurate estimation of the battery's SOC (State of Charge) is crucial to extending its service life. This study proposes a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) combined with Sparse Identification Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy). Given that the voltage change rate and current change rate of the battery evolve dynamically over time under a specific discharge mode, SINDy can effectively capture these nonlinear changes and build the kinetic equations of voltage and current on this basis, thereby extracting the voltage change rate and current change rate with physical significance as additional input features of the neural network to expand the feature space. Experimental results on NaNiCl<inf>2</inf> battery data show that this method can significantly reduce the SOC estimation error when the feature information is limited.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents an Energy Management System (EMS) for a grid-tied Low-Voltage Direct Current (LVDC) Microgrid (MG) equipped with Photovoltaic (PV) units, Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs), and AC and DC loads. The objective of this EMS is to minimize the facility's operational costs associated with the energy exchange with the external network. Optimal Power Flow (OPF) equations are included in the EMS model in non-linear and linear forms. In the former case, the optimization problem is defined as a MixedInteger Quadratically Constrained Programming (MIQCP) problem, while the latter is a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem. The case study is a 3-bus MG, for which the deviation between the results obtained with the two formulations of OPF equations is evaluated. In this way, the impact of the linearized approach on electrical, economic, and computational performances is assessed. A sensitivity analysis carried out by varying the parameters of the lines shows the limits and the validity domain of the approximation introduced by linear OPF equations, also focusing on computational aspects. When considering the base length of the lines, the results prove a negligible impact on Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) in voltages (0.01%) and power (1.71%) between the non-linear and linear implementations. On the other hand, the findings show a growing trend in terms of MAPE when increasing the length of the lines and higher differences in the OPF results. However, the computation time of the linear implementation (0.79 s) is significantly lower in comparison to the non-linear approach (632.4 s).",

      "abstract": "Energy communities (ECs) are currently seen as an important pathway to increase the participation of citizens in the energy transition. The present work proposes a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) optimization model that provides the optimal design of a renewable energy community (REC) in terms of best technologies and chosen members. Different objective functions are investigated so that the REC's design can be studied from different perspectives. The first objective is related to the minimization of total annualized costs (TAC) while the second one regards the maximization of the shared energy. The model considers one year as time horizon with a timestep of one hour. A case study is defined by considering the municipality of Plodio, located in the northwest of Italy, as the host of a potential REC. A total of 11 possible users are introduced, including municipality and residential users. In cost-optimized scenarios, the REC design is characterized by fewer users but has the maximum installation of PV modules. However, most of the revenues are obtained due to the selling of electricity and not due to its sharing. When the shared energy is maximized, all the candidate members are chosen and technologies such as wind turbines and batteries are exploited to increase the number of periods characterized by the injection of electricity into the grid. It is also noted that higher electricity prices increase the profitability of the investment. Finally, it is shown that the inclusion of an industrial user positively influences energy-sharing indicators.",

This work presents a novel model of an energy management system (EMS) for grid-connected polygeneration microgrids that allows optimizing the management of electrical storage systems, electric vehicles, and other deferrable loads such as heat pumps. The main novelty of this model is that it incorporates both climate comfort variables and the consideration of the degradation of the energy storage capacity in the control strategy, as well as a penalty for the dumping of surpluses. The model has been applied to a smart, sustainable building as a case study. The results show that the proposed model is highly adaptable to diverse weather conditions, minimizing renewable energy losses while satisfying the energy demand and providing comfort to the building’s users. The study shows (i) that EVs’ dynamic charging schedules play a crucial role, (ii) that it is possible to minimize a battery’s degradation by optimizing its cycling, averaging one cycle per day, and (iii) the critical impact of seasonal weather patterns on microgrid energy management and the strategic role of EVs and storage systems in maintaining energy balance and efficiency.",

      "abstract": "Renewable Energy Communities (RECs) are being deployed all around the World as a technically feasible solution to decreasing users' dependence on fossil fuels. Several demonstration facilities have shown their potential to provide final consumers with clean energy and all associated environmental benefits. However, the economic evaluation of these systems as a whole set is more complex than evaluating generation technologies individually, which can be considered a barrier, and it may be more complicated to calculate its uncertainty with precision. This paper deals with this challenge and adapts a model for the evaluation of the global Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) of a polygeneration microgrid to the characteristics of a typical REC, allowing the assessment of the distribution of the LCOE depending on the uncertainty of the input parameters. Thanks to its simple analytical formulation, the proposed model, that can be used for any combination of technologies (both renewable and conventional), provides relevant information on uncertainty propagation in a symbolic way that avoids the need to run numerical simulations or make assumptions on the distribution of the random input parameters. A case study has been presented, considering a typical small electrical REC with photovoltaic plants and micro wind turbines. Although the model can be defined to any market, as a representative example, it has been evaluated according to the current Spanish and Italian regulations, which are analyzed in depth with reference to the scientific literature. Results show that uncertainties in parameter estimates give rise to a very large scatter in the LCOE, pointing out a set of quantities whose role is crucial for a reliable estimate, among which electricity purchase and selling prices, yearly power load, and self-consumption / virtually-shared energy rates stand out.",

      "abstract": "The integration of renewable energy sources in the European power system is one of the main goals set by the European Union. In order to ease this integration, in recent years, Renewable Energy Communities (RECs) have been introduced that aim to increase the exploitation of renewable energy at the local level. This paper presents an Energy Management System (EMS) for an industrial microgrid owned and operated by a greentech company located in the north of Italy. The company is a member of an REC. The microgrid is made of interconnected busbars, integrating photovoltaic power plants, a fleet of electric vehicles, including company cars and delivery trucks supporting Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G), dedicated charging stations, and a centralized battery energy storage system. The industrial site includes two warehouses, an office building, and a connection to the external medium-voltage network. The EMS is designed to optimize the operation of the microgrid and minimize the operating costs related to the sale and purchase of energy from the external network. Furthermore, as the company is a member of an REC, the EMS must try to follow a desired power exchange profile with the grid, suggested by the REC manager, with the purpose of maximizing the energy that is shared within the community and incentivized. The results demonstrate that, when minimizing only costs, local self-consumption is favored, leading to a Self-Sufficiency Rate (SSR) of 65.37%. On the other hand, when only the adherence to the REC manager’s desired power exchange profile is considered in the objective function, the SSR decreases to 56.43%, net operating costs increase, and the energy shared within the REC is maximized.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, efforts have been made to increase the proportion of electricity demand met by Renewable Energy Sources (RESs). Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) play a crucial role in this frame, particularly in Microgrids (MGs) where DERs and clusters of loads are interconnected. This paper presents an Energy Management System (EMS) developed for a low-voltage MG installed in Italy, connecting Photovoltaic (PV) units, a Wind Turbine (WT), a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS), a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) unit and loads: the EMS aims to optimize the day-ahead scheduling of the MG, considering both economic and power quality criteria. The mathematical model incorporates the capability curves of the inverters connected to DERs and allows for curtailment of PV and WT units, with curtailment costs assessed using the Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE). Penalties for the absorption of reactive power from the external network are considered and evaluated in accordance with the current regulatory framework. Optimal Power Flow (OPF) equations are integrated into the EMS model, too. A preliminary analysis, carried out on a simplified MG, evaluates the impact of linearizing the DERs capability curves and OPF equations on the EMS's outcomes. Finally, a sensitivity analysis evaluates the impact of different operational constraints and of different objective function formulations on the operation of the MG, discussing key energy and economic results.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a tool that allows to perform an ex-ante estimation of the profitability to participate to the electric energy and service markets for a microgrid or a polygeneration power plant. The tool is the evolution of an Energy Management System (EMS) previously developed by the University of Genoa and Renantis Solutions Srl. Constraints are added to the original EMS to model the Ancillary Service Market (ASM) and Day Ahead Market (DAM) mechanisms in the framework of a planning tool that allows to get estimates of the microgrid/plant costs and revenues over a long-time horizon. As the market outcome strongly depends on the Transmission System Operator (TSO) acceptance/rejection of bids and offers, a statistical approach is proposed. The optimization process is split in two steps: the first one optimally dispatches the energy units and proposes DAM offers and ASM bid and offers over a specified time horizon. Then, a Monte Carlo method is launched; at each extraction the TSO acceptance/rejection of each ASM bid and offer is simulated and there is a second step of optimization in which the energy sources are optimally re-dispatched to meet the bidding program and so to avoid imbalance power exchange that would increase the energy cost. The cost/revenue is thus computed at each extraction. The result is the probability density function of the costs/revenues that allows to estimate the profitability of the participation to the electricity markets. One test performed on a real microgrid shows that the computational time needed to complete one iteration related to a time horizon of one month is approximately 20 s. Moreover, the comparison of the outcomes with two independent launches to define the set of bids and offers to be accepted in ASM demonstrates that the statistical analysis allows to avoid misleading conclusions on the costs/revenues. Consequently, the fact that the developed EMS allows to perform a statistical analysis in a reasonable time enables the possibility of comparing multiple scenarios and gives an indication related to the range of cost/revenues in which the microgrid/plant may incur. Finally, the computational efficiency of the proposed approach allows to conclude that the developed EMS is appropriate to perform a long-time horizon (of the order of magnitude of years) analysis and, at the same time, allows to model all the involved components with a high level of details.",

      "abstract": "The integration of distributed energy resources in the power grid supposes a great challenge, considering the expected growing in the electric mobility and the renewable generation. Therefore, to support the successful deployment of these resources, energy management according to the expected behaviors of the elements of power grids is required. In this sense, the probabilistic forecasting methods are gaining acceptance, as they provide richer information than deterministic methods thanks to the consideration of expected probabilities. One of their problems is that the application of metrics for choosing the best models is not simple, depending on the objective of the type of probabilistic prediction that must be performed. In this paper, diverse types of forecasting are performed, and two possible approaches for selecting interval forecasting models are compared in a case study centered on the Smart Polygeneration Microgrid (SPM) located on the Savona Campus of University of Genova (Italy). The results show that, for the machine learning models that were tested, it is better to obtain a model for each of the different types of forecasting that are required (quantiles, and the prediction intervals) to have better-quality predictions. The average improvement on the quality of the tested prediction intervals for the three forecasted variables were a 27.40%, 7.39%, and 28.65% in their Winkler score respectively.",

      "abstract": "The increase of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) in low-voltage distribution networks (LVDN) requires accurate phase topology information of single-phase users. However, this information is not always available or, when it is, is often unreliable. Although there are methods in the literature for the automatic phase topology identification in LVDN, the influence of DERs on their performance has not been widely studied. In this paper, an evaluation of the influence of DERs in phase topology identification is presented. Five DER penetration scenarios (0%, 5%, 10%, 20% and 40%) over a LVDN with 459 users were used. A total of three state-of-the-art methods from the literature were tested. All of them showed an accuracy decrease when DER penetration increases. However, the one proposed by the authors showed the smallest decrease (from 100% without DER to 95.87% with 40% DER penetration) compared to the others, which showed a greater influence (from 99.76% to 89.81% and from 97.77% to 52.67% respectively).",

      "abstract": "The reduction of Green House Gases (GHGs) emissions has been the top priority of the European Union (EU) in recent times. The increase in use of Electric Vehicles (EVs) to combat climate change is viable only with the use of Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) to power them. Since the Paris Agreement in 2015, the integration of RESs into the charging infrastructure has increased in the EU. The increasing market share of EVs in various categories has called for immediate changes in the EV charging infrastructure and in the operation of charging hubs. This paper aims to present an Energy Management System (EMS) to efficiently manage an EV charging hub fed by RESs, reducing the daily costs of operation and GHG emissions. The mathematical model of the EMS is developed in Matlab as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model. The MILP-based EMS is applied to the real-world case of an innovative EV charging hub located in the Ligurian region of Italy and the results of the optimization are reported.",

      "abstract": "Energy management systems (EMSs) play a central role in improving the performance of microgrids by ensuring their efficient operation while minimizing operational costs and environmental impacts. This paper presents a comprehensive study of mixed integer linear programming (MILP) based EMSs developed and implemented in MATLAB 2021a using YALMIP software for the energy management of a new positive energy district in the city of Savona, Italy, as part of the Interreg Alpine Space Project ALPGRIDS. The main objective of this research is to optimize the functioning of the microgrid, focusing on cost efficiency and environmental sustainability. In pursuit of this objective, the EMS undergoes comprehensive testing and analysis, replicating actual conditions and addressing the diverse demands of end-users across typical days throughout the year, considering real electricity selling and purchase prices. The EMS also accounts for the reactive power capabilities of the various technologies integrated into the microgrid. The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) serves as a metric for assessing curtailment costs, while penalties related to reactive power absorption from the distribution network are appraised in alignment with prevailing regulatory guidelines. The case study provides valuable insights into the practical implementation of EMS technology in microgrids and demonstrates its potential for sustainable energy management in complex urban energy districts. In all scenarios, the battery energy storage system (BESS) and combined heat and power (CHP) are pivotal for load satisfaction and microgrid resilience. BESSs balance supply and demand, which are crucial in periods of low renewable energy availability, while the versatile CHP efficiently addresses energy demands, contributing significantly to overall microgrid effectiveness. Their synergy ensures reliable load satisfaction, showcasing the dynamic and adaptive nature of microgrid energy management across diverse scenarios.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes a multi-scale control scheme aimed at controlling speed, dwell time, and charging time of electric and automated buses performing the transport service on lines where there are no reserved lanes. The proposed control scheme has two layers characterized by different control objectives, level of detail and time scales. The high-level controller periodically solves a multi-objective optimal control problem formalized to ensure an adequate transport service, while the low-level controller, being based on a more accurate description of the bus dynamics and energy consumption, seeks to follow the high-level control actions while taking into account the effective traffic conditions encountered on the line and the effective dynamic behaviour of the bus. The paper concludes with the application to a case study in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.",

      "abstract": "Electric mobility is one of the key components of the smart mobility transition that most of the cities worldwide are living nowadays. Besides the electrification of private cars, a great contribution in this direction is given by public transport, since a growing number of electric buses is appearing in most of the cities. At the same time, another important innovation is completely changing the mobility concept, that is, the technology allowing increasing levels of automation on board of vehicles. The mobility of public transport of the future smart cities will be then represented by fleets of electric automated vehicles. In order to correctly plan and control such vehicles, it is necessary, first of all, to develop appropriate models able to represent the dynamic behavior of buses when interacting with other vehicles on the road and able to estimate their energy consumption when traveling in the city roads. On the basis of such models, proper control algorithms can be designed in order to regulate the behavior of buses which have to follow a specific route and respect a fixed timetable. In this chapter, we provide an overview on electric buses, by highlighting the main modeling and control challenges, and by providing some possible traffic and consumption models, as well as some traffic control algorithms for optimizing bus speeds, dwell and charging times.",

      "abstract": "Reforms in the transport sector have been on the rise since the Paris Agreement in 2015. Given that the reduction of CO<inf>2</inf> emissions in the transportation sector and the dependence on fossil fuels for energy production is at the forefront of the European Union's (EU) climate goals., the rapid growth in the use of Electric Vehicles (EVs) for personnel and logistics transport has fuelled the increase of improved EV charging infrastructures integrated with Renewable Energy Sources (RES). This paper aims to present an Energy Management System (EMS) to optimize the operation of an EV charging hub fed by RES thereby reducing the operational costs of the hub and the dependence on the public grid. Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is used to develop the mathematical model of the EMS implemented in MATLAB and solved by Gurobi. An EV charging hub fed by a wind farm and a photovoltaic (PV) plant., located in the Ligurian region of Italy., is selected as a case study for the EMS and the results of the optimization are reported.",

      "abstract": "This manuscript proposes to study different cases that require the use of renewable energies in addition to diesel generators and energy storage systems with the aim of increasing the resilience of a microgrid feeding critical facilities. The aim of the work here presented is to quantify the benefits provided by an improvement of the energy resilience that could be achieved by installing a microgrid in a hospital fed by renewable energy sources. The microgrid will use a scheme based on solar PV in addition to diesel generators and an energy storage system based on electrochemical batteries. First, it has been evaluated how the implant of the microgrid increases the resilience of the power supply when a power failure occurs, considering that the main application in a hospital, even in the event of breakdowns, is to ensure the continuity of the surgical procedures and safely store drug stocks. Thus, these has been defined as the critical loads of the system. The components sizes have been optimized by considering both economic profitability but also the resilience capacity, observing that, by installing solar photovoltaic modules, Li-ion batteries and diesel generators, the microgrid could save approximately $440,191 over a 20-year life cycle of the facility (both considering the mitigation of energy provide by the power grid and the avoided losses during probable power services interruptions), while increasing the minimum resilience of the installation more than 34 h.",

The house is equipped with a Photovoltaic (PV) plant and a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS). The building is connected to the low-voltage distribution grid and the integration of an Electric Vehicle (EV) with a dedicated charging wall-box is considered as a further scenario. In the first phase of the analysis, the performance of the system is examined without the inclusion of the EV, comparing the results of the developed EMS with real-world data. This phase aims to test the effectiveness of the proposed EMS, if compared to the one supplied by the PV and BESS provider: in the two representative months, January and August, the proposed EMS allows a reduction of net operating costs of 10.0 % and 1.9 % respectively. In the second phase of the analysis, the integration of the EV into the household context is considered, enabling Vehicle-to-Home (V2H). Economic and energy Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) show the effectiveness of the proposed EMS and the beneficial effects of EV and V2H integration, as proved by a Self-Consumption Rate (SCR) of 92.9 % in January and by a Self-Sufficiency Rate (SSR) of 99.9 % in August.",

      "abstract": "In the contemporary energy landscape, characterized by a global commitment to sustainability, the effective management and forecasting of energy consumption play pivotal roles in achieving environmental and economic goals. As nations strive to meet sustainable development targets, optimizing energy use becomes imperative. This paper addresses these challenges by focusing on load forecasting and energy management within the context of a Savona campus microgrid. In this thesis, the NNR algorithm based load profile prediction model was proposed. The development process involved a detailed exploration of the correlation between weather information and electricity consumption. Furthermore, the outputs of the load forecasting model, namely the predicted load profiles, were subsequently utilized in the Energy Management System (EMS) to optimally manage power flows in the campus microgrid using an Internet of things as a service (IoTaaS) with day-ahead forecasting model. The overall results of the model evaluation across all periods reveal a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 9.63 kW, a Coefficient of Determination (R2) of 0.79, and a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 9.02%. These metrics provide a comprehensive assessment of the model's performance across various temperature conditions. The proposed load profile forecasting model was integrated into the Energy Management System (EMS) developed for Savona campus microgrid in Italy. The findings provide a valuable framework for optimizing microgrid operations, aligning with global sustainability objectives.",

      "abstract": "The integration of renewable energy systems in buildings leads to a reduction in energy bills for end users and a reduction in the carbon footprint of such buildings, usually referred to as prosumers. In addition, the installation of charging points for the electric vehicles of people working or living in these buildings can further improve the energy efficiency of the whole system if innovative technologies, such as vehicle-to-building (V2B) technologies, are implemented. The aim of this paper is to present an Energy Management System (EMS) based on mathematical programming that has been developed to optimally manage a prosumer building equipped with photovoltaics, a micro wind turbine and several charging points for electric vehicles. Capabilities curves of renewable power plant inverters are modelled within the EMS, as well as the possibility to apply power curtailment and V2B. The use of V2B technology reduces the amount of electricity purchased from the public grid, while the use of smart inverters for the power plants allows zero reactive power to be drawn from the grid. Levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) is used to quantify curtailment costs, while penalties on reactive power absorption from the distribution network are evaluated in accordance with the current regulatory framework. Specifically, the model is applied to a prosumer building owned by the postal service in a large city in Italy. The paper reports the main results of the study and proposes a sensitivity analysis on the number of charging stations and vehicles, as well as on the consideration of different typical days characterized by different load and generation profiles. This paper also investigates how errors in forecasting energy production from renewable sources impact the optimal operation of the whole system.",

      "abstract": "One of the main ways to reach the important targets of the European Commission in the energy field set by 2030 is to implement sustainable energy systems to cover electrical and thermal energy demands, as well as transportation needs, in urban areas. In the aforesaid scenario, multi-vector energy hubs consist of installing small and medium size power plants, mainly fed by renewable sources, and charging infrastructures for electric vehicles in sustainable urban districts. The optimal design of such systems can be faced from different points of view and using different methods, one of the most adopted being the development of mathematical programming algorithms typically aimed to minimize global costs and emissions. The contribution of this paper is to propose an innovative methodology to optimally design a multi-vector energy hub able to supply electricity and thermal energy, for space heating and cooling, to a set of buildings within a sustainable district acting as a local energy community. The developed mixed integer linear programming model is characterized by very detailed models of the technologies and by a multi-objective function which is proposed to evaluate the impact of the optimal solution on global costs and emissions. The proposed mathematical model is very comprehensive as it involves a wide range of energy technologies with detailed modelling by considering the impact of external ambient conditions and energy vector temperature values on the plant conversion efficiency, thus showing high replicability potential in real contexts. In the case study, the model is applied to a university campus in the North of Italy.",

      "abstract": "European countries aim to reach important targets in the energy field through the increase of energy efficiency in final uses, the exploitation of renewable energy sources, and the implementation of energy communities. In the aforesaid framework, renewable energy self-consumers represent a smart solution to foster the adoption of renewable energy power plants and storage systems in the residential and tertiary sectors. The goal of the paper is to propose an optimization-based methodology to evaluate the impact of electric mobility on the optimal design of renewable energy collective self-consumers. The integration of renewable sources and storage systems with charging infrastructures for electric vehicles is analyzed and discussed by running a stochastic optimization model, developed in Matlab/Yalmip, to evaluate different scenarios with different electric mobility penetration levels. The paper shows how the presence of electric vehicles increases the optimal installed size of the RES plants significantly, from 15% up to more than 25%. Moreover, it underlines how the optimal charging system, in terms of type, number, and size of charging stations, is affected by the considered number of electric vehicles but also by the model and thus the characteristics of the electric vehicles such as the maximum accepted charging power in AC and DC modes.",

      "abstract": "To face the complexity introduced by the ever-increasing participation of new energy sources, storage systems and controllable loads to electricity markets, Distributed Energy Systems must optimize the power exchange. Usually, Energy Management System (EMS) are used to manage Micro-Grids (MGs) operations, but computational timings may become prohibitive, due to high number of constraints and links between parameters and technical constraints. This paper describes the evolution of the Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) MATLAB Based Energy Management System (MB-EMS) developed at the University of Genoa, aimed at optimizing the operating costs of a MG or plant, considering technical constraints and limitations of electrical and thermal production units, energy storage systems, non-programmable loads and flexible loads. Costs related to maintenance interventions and CO<inf>2</inf>emissions costs are also included, as well as incentives related to the High-Efficiency Cogeneration systems. Specific test cases for a real MG are solved in a short computational time over a time horizon of one year. Calculations are rapidly performed, also when dealing with 15 minutes resolution problems. In this sense, the developed tool can be used both as a real time scheduler, as instance for participation in the energy market sector, and in long term planning problems.",

      "abstract": "The usage of photovoltaic (PV) systems has been rapidly increasing in recent years to generate green electricity. Anomaly detection in PV systems is essential to improve reliability, ensure electricity production and equipment safety, and decrease their negative impact on the economy of the operation system. This paper proposes an effective anomaly detection model based on a deep neural network autoencoder, which accurately identifies PV system anomalies. The presented model only uses measured PV power production as input and does not need additional equipment data collection. The results demonstrate that the proposed model is superior to existing data-driven solutions regarding different evaluation accuracy metrics to detect anomalies in PV systems. The proposed model is validated and assessed on a PV power plant in Genoa, Italy. Obtained numerical results of the case study show the superiority of the developed model compared to principal component analysis and other machine learning classification models. In comparison to other machine learning models, the proposed model accurately detected all faults in the test dataset, achieving an F1-score accuracy of 82%.",

      "keywords": "integrated local energy community | multi-objective approach | sector coupling | stochastic operation optimization",
      "abstract": "Aiming at integrating different energy sectors and exploiting the synergies coming from the interaction of different energy carriers, sector coupling allows for a greater flexibility of the energy system, by increasing renewables’ penetration and reducing carbon emissions. At the local level, sector coupling fits well in the concept of an integrated local energy community (ILEC), where active consumers make common choices for satisfying their energy needs through the optimal management of a set of multi-carrier energy technologies, by achieving better economic and environmental benefits compared to the business-as-usual scenario. This paper discusses the stochastic operation optimization of the smart Savona Campus of the University of Genoa, according to economic and environmental criteria. The campus is treated as an ILEC with two electrically interconnected multi-energy hubs involving technologies such as PV, solar thermal, combined heat and power systems, electric and geothermal heat pumps, absorption chillers, electric and thermal storage. Under this prism, the ILEC can participate in the day-ahead market (DAM) with proper bidding strategies. To assess the renewables’ uncertainties, the roulette wheel method is used to generate an initial set of scenarios for solar irradiance, and the fast forward selection algorithm is then applied to preserve the most representative scenarios, while reducing the computational load of the next optimization phase. A stochastic optimization model is thus formulated through mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), with the aim to optimize the operation strategies of the various technologies in the ILEC, as well as the bidding strategies of the ILECs in the DAM, considering both energy costs and carbon emissions through a multi-objective approach. Case study results show how the optimal bidding strategies of the ILEC on the DAM allow minimizing of the users’ net daily cost, and, as in the case of environmental optimization, the ILEC operates in self-consumption mode. Moreover, in comparison to the current operation strategies, the optimized case allows reduction of the daily net energy cost in a range from 5 to 14%, and the net daily carbon emissions in a range from 6 to 18%.",

      "abstract": "The ever-increasing participation of new energy sources, storage systems and controllable loads to electricity markets has introduced more complexity in the operation of power plants, microgrids (MGs) and networks. To face these issues, it is often necessary to design Distributed Energy Systems to optimize the power exchange. Usually, MG operation is managed by an Energy Management System (EMS) dealing with large amounts of parameters to be taken into account and that may drive to problems difficult to be faced and requiring long computational timings. In this direction, this paper describes the Mixed Integer Linear Programming MATLAB Based Energy Management System (MB-EMS) developed at the University of Genoa, aimed at optimizing the operating costs of a generic polygeneration system, considering different electrical and thermal production units, energy storage systems, non-programmable loads and flexible loads. Many important technical details are accounted: the duration and costs related to maintenance interventions and CO<inf>2</inf> emissions costs are considered for all production units as well as constraints and incentives related to the High-Efficiency Cogeneration systems. Constraints related to the minimum and maximum State-Of-Charge of energy storage systems, plus their deterioration, with the consequent optimization of their utilization, are also modelled. Specific test cases for all functionalities are presented. Moreover, a test related to a real MG performed over a time horizon of one year with a time step of 1 h is performed and solved in a short computational time. The linearization of constraints reduces the computational effort, avoiding the need of clustering or averaging parameters for similar production units. Consequently, calculations are rapidly performed, also when dealing with long term planning problems (a realistic test case with time horizon of one year and time step of 15 min can be simulated in some seconds). In this sense, the developed tool can be used both in real time operation and in long term planning problems.",

      "abstract": "This contribution discusses the combined impact of the uncertainties related to the forecasts of the power production from Renewable Energy Sources, the Electrical Load and the Thermal Load on the operation costs of a microgrid. To quantify the possible variation of the cost determined by an Energy Management System, a stochastic approach has been adopted. The perturbation of the forecasted data is obtained adding to the abovementioned variables random numbers according to a suitable Probability Density Function. To this purpose, both Uniform and Normal distribution have been used. The analysis is developed referring to a test case facility: the Smart Polygeneration Microgrid of the University of Genoa. Among the possible cases, four combinations have been presented, to perturb the data with a 5%, 20% and 50% variation. The analyzed cases show that an increase in the error on the forecasts of the Electrical Load, the Thermal Load and the production from Renewable Energy Sources, causes a final cost increase. As expected, lower perturbations produce lower deviations with respect to the cost calculated by the Energy Management System. For all the presented cases, no significant differences in the minimum and maximum deviation from the costs calculated by the Energy Management System when variables are perturbated using a Normal or Uniform Probability Density Function have been found. The application of perturbations on a real test facility shows the reliability of the calculations performed by the Energy Management System, also considering the fact that the Electric Load, the Thermal Load and the power production from Renewable Energy Sources are parameters affected by uncertainty.",

      "abstract": "A microgrid is a group of interconnected loads and distributed generation sources that acts as a single entity with respect to the public grid. The implementation of a microgrid providing energy to different users located in the same urban area can lead to environmental and economic benefits. Nowadays many urban redevelopment projects are opting for microgrids to reduce energy bills and to meet the criteria of positive energy districts. In this paper the optimal planning of a microgrid with the help of HOMER Grid software is accomplished. The simulation of the annual operation of the microgrid is performed applying all the required constraints to obtain the optimal sizing of the installed technologies consisting of PV plants, storage battery systems, CHP units, and micro wind turbines. Different scenarios are analyzed as a function of variable electricity purchase and selling prices, as well as considering current incentive mechanisms. The analyzed microgrid has been designed in the city of Savona, in the North of Italy, within the Interreg Alpine Space ALPGRIDS project.",

The second case study is the Smart Energy Building (SEB), also placed at the Savona Campus, which represents a nanogrid with thermal and electrical devices. Finally, the third case study covers the ERESMAGrid, an electrical microgrid at the Campus of Vegazana of the University of León (Spain), which includes several renewable energy generators and an electrochemical storage system. In the aforesaid three cases, a probabilistic approach based on Monte Carlo method is applied, modeling the uncertainty of the main input parameters by suitable statistical distributions.",

      "abstract": "The deployment of Energy Communities can help to increase the provision of sustainable energy from renewable energy sources at urban, industrial, and commercial levels, granting benefits to all the community members. Their effective integration in the form of microgrids (and nanogrids) will undoubtedly help to decarbonize the energy sector and, at the same time, increase energy resiliency. The main purpose of this book is to provide a systematic framework for the calculation of the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOEn) for Energy Communities proposing a general formulation and its application to three representative real case studies. To the authors’ knowledge, the existing literature does not address this issue yet. This book is intended for researchers, academics and postgraduate students in energy engineering and economics, promoters of energy projects, policymakers and, in general, for anyone interested in energy sustainability and renewable energy integration. In this chapter, we present the context and the aim of the book, its organization and a brief biographical sketch of the authors.`",

      "abstract": "In this chapter we present the fundamentals of the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOEn) focusing on renewable power plants and multi-vector energy systems. After having introduced the basic formulation for the LCOEn, we extend its definition to polygeneration systems, hybrid systems (generators working in parallel with energy storage devices as a single unit) and microgrids/nanogrids. Although we focus on the LCOE (Levelized Cost of Electricity) we also analyze other variants of LCOEn (i.e., Levelized Cost of Stored Energy: LCOS, Levelized Cost of Heat: LCOH, and Levelized Cost of Cooling: LCOC). Furthermore, we present a novel approach to analyze multi-vector energy systems and we propose the Levelized Cost of Exergy (LCOEx) as a new useful indicator in the field.",

      "abstract": "The present paper proposes a new methodology to aid the electrification process of local public transport (LPT). In more detail, real drive cycles of traditional buses currently in use are evaluated together with other data to simulate the consumption of equivalent e-buses (electric buses) with similar characteristics. The results are then used in order to design the best charging infrastructure. The proposed methodology is applied to the case study of Algeciras Bay, where a specific line of LPT is considered. Real measurements are used as data for the simulation model, and the average consumption of an equivalent e-bus is obtained for different operating conditions. Based on these results, different sizes and locations for fast-charging infrastructure are proposed, and the size of the depot charging system is defined trying to maintain the current buses timetable. Finally, some future developments of the present work are presented by considering other bus lines that may benefit from the introduction of the defined charging systems.",

      "abstract": "As reported in the “Clean energy for all Europeans package” set by the EU, a sustainable transition from fossil fuels towards cleaner energy is necessary to improve the quality of life of citizens and the livability in cities. The exploitation of renewable sources, the improvement of energy performance in buildings and the need for cutting-edge national energy and climate plans represent important and urgent topics to be faced in order to implement the sustainability concept in urban areas. In addition, the spread of polygeneration microgrids and the recent development of energy communities enable a massive installation of renewable power plants, high-performance small-size cogeneration units, and electrical storage systems; moreover, properly designed local energy production systems make it possible to optimize the exploitation of green energy sources and reduce both energy supply costs and emissions. In the present paper, a set of key performance indicators is introduced in order to evaluate and compare different energy communities both from a technical and environmental point of view. The proposed methodology was used in order to assess and compare two sites characterized by the presence of sustainable energy infrastructures: the Savona Campus of the University of Genoa in Italy, where a polygeneration microgrid has been in operation since 2014 and new technologies will be installed in the near future, and the SPEED2030 District, an urban area near the Campus where renewable energy power plants (solar and wind), cogeneration units fed by hydrogen and storage systems are planned to be installed.",

      "abstract": "Short-term electric power forecasting is a tool of great interest for power systems, where the presence of renewable and distributed generation sources is constantly growing. Specifically, this type of forecasting is essential for energy management systems in buildings, industries and microgrids for optimizing the operation of their distributed energy resources under different criteria based on their expected daily energy balance (the consumption–generation relationship). Under this situation, this paper proposes a complete framework for the short-term multistep forecasting of electric power consumption and generation in smart grids and microgrids. One advantage of the proposed framework is its capability of evaluating numerous combinations of inputs, making it possible to identify the best technique and the best set of inputs in each case. Therefore, even in cases with insufficient input information, the framework can always provide good forecasting results. Particularly, in this paper, the developed framework is used to compare a whole set of rule-based and machine learning techniques (artificial neural networks and random forests) to perform day-ahead forecasting. Moreover, the paper presents and a new approach consisting of the use of baseline models as inputs for machine learning models, and compares it with others. Our results show that this approach can significantly improve upon the compared techniques, achieving an accuracy improvement of up to 62% over that of a persistence model, which is the best of the compared algorithms across all application cases. These results are obtained from the application of the proposed methodology to forecasting five different load and generation power variables for the Savona Campus at the University of Genova in Italy.",

      "abstract": "The integration of electric mobility with energy systems based on renewable sources represents one of the main pillars of sustainable cities and, in particular, of Local Energy Communities. This leads to reduce the environmental impact in urban areas and contributes to the implementation of the microgrid concept. Electric mobility services mainly include the use of electric buses, car sharing, bike sharing, and e-scooters. The aforesaid services fit well with university campuses where the transportation demand is considerable and sustainability is a challenging target. In this framework, the present paper aims to propose a methodology to optimally define and design electric services for a Local Energy Community which takes energy from a microgrid based on the exploitation of renewable energy sources and storage systems. The study considers the application of the proposed methodology, based on a mixed-integer linear programming model, to a university campus in Italy. Starting from the analysis of the results of a survey created to identify the needs of end-users, the model determines the optimal configuration of the electric mobility system made of shuttles, cars and bikes as well as charging points. The optimization model also investigates the opportunity of upgrading the set of renewable energy and storage technologies present in the microgrid of the campus to which the electric mobility infrastructures will be connected. In the paper some different scenarios are analyzed in order to compare the proposed electric mobility services from the technical and economic point of view, referring to the considered case study.",

      "abstract": "Multi-energy systems (MES) connect different energy networks using conversion technologies, leveraging alternative supply paths and redundancy to improve the integration of renewable energy, the reliability and the profitability of energy supply. This paper investigates MES reliability by integrating a pre-and post-failure operational optimization into a reliability assessment based on an alternating renewal process. Expected energy not supplied and uninterrupted supply times are used to quantify the MES’ ability to withstand failures of technologies, networks and external grid supply. The method is applied to a Swiss MES that supplies thermal and electrical energy demands of a mixed-use district. A comparison of system configurations with electricity-and gas-based conversion technologies, energy storage and distributed photovoltaic generation shows that both electricity- and gas-based MES are highly reliable due to the high reliability of the Swiss electricity grid. Introducing centralized battery storage and distributed photovoltaic panels further increases the probability of uninterrupted supply and decreases the expected energy not supplied. However, reliability is not always increased by introducing conversion technologies that couple energy carriers. In fact, heat pumps introduce a dependency of the heat supply on electricity, while combined heat and power plants can be less reliable than other technologies, thus increasing the expected energy not supplied.",

      "abstract": "We investigate the optimal operation of multi-energy systems deploying geothermal energy storage to deal with the seasonal variability of heating and cooling demands. We do this by developing an optimization model that improves on the state-of-the-art by accounting for the nonlinearities of the physical system, and by capturing both the short- and long-term dynamics of energy conversion, storage and consumption. The algorithm aims at minimizing the CO<inf>2</inf> emissions of the system while satisfying the heating and cooling demands of given end-users, and it determines the optimal operation of the system, i.e. the mass flow rate and temperature of the water circulating through the network, accounting for the time evolution of the temperature of the geothermal fields. This optimization model is developed with reference to a real-world application, namely the Anergy Grid installed at ETH Zurich, in Switzerland. Here, centralized heating and cooling provision based on fossil fuels is complemented by a dynamic underground network connecting geothermal fields, acting as energy source and storage, and demand end-users requiring heating and cooling energy. The proposed optimization algorithm allows reducing the CO<inf>2</inf> emissions of the university campus by up to 87% with respect to the use of a conventional system based on centralized heating and cooling. This improves on the 72% emissions reduction achieved with the current operation strategies. Furthermore, the analysis of the system allows to derive design guidelines and to explain the rationale behind the operation of the system. The study highlights the importance of coupling daily and seasonal energy storage towards the achievement of low-carbon energy systems.",

      "abstract": "The exploitation of distributed renewable energy sources leads to a low-carbon energy transition, mainly based on the optimal integration of hydro, PV and wind power plants with the remaining high-performance fossil-fuel power stations. In the last twenty years, European Union (EU) countries have shown a significant increase of the power installed in new PV and wind power plants, together with the refurbishment of small and medium size hydro stations. In particular, in Italy, PV and wind energy production has strongly increased and nowadays there are regions characterized by a very green energy mix. In this new scenario, energy storage becomes a viable solution to mitigate the variability of renewable energy sources thus optimizing the network operation. The present paper is focused on the Liguria region, in the North of Italy and in particular on the Bormida Valley where nowadays more than the half of the annual electricity consumption is covered by the renewable energy local production. The paper describes the current energy situation and proposes an optimization tool to investigate the possibility of installing new PV and wind power plants, as well as energy intensive storage units based on sodium-sulphur batteries; moreover, different scenarios are analyzed through the definition of economic and environmental key performance indicators.",

This facility is not allowed to inject surplus energy into the public distribution power grid in order to minimize network congestions. As stationary energy storage devices are not competitive at nanogrid level nowadays, the smart charging of electric vehicles seems to be a feasible and cost-effective solution. The paper describes the Mixed-Integer Linear Programming model which has been specifically developed to operate the nanogrid optimally allowing a 76% reduction of the curtailed energy in comparison with the same system without the smart charging station, and a 67% daily savings in comparison with a traditional consumer of the same size and characteristics.",

Results show the impact of the initial state of charge (SOC) of the electrical vehicles (EVs) at the beginning of the day on the capability of balancing either the overestimation or the underestimation of the PV production.

      "abstract": "This manuscript proposes to study different cases that require the use of renewable energies in addition to diesel generators and energy storage systems with the aim of increasing the resilience of a microgrid feeding critical facilities. The aim of the work here presented is to quantify the benefits provided by an improvement of the energy resilience that could be achieved by installing a microgrid in a hospital fed by renewable energy sources. The microgrid will use a scheme based on solar PV in addition to diesel generators and an energy storage system based on electrochemical batteries. First, it has been evaluated how the implant of the microgrid increases the resilience of the power supply when a power failure occurs, considering that the main application in a hospital, even in the event of breakdowns, is to ensure the continuity of the surgical procedures and safely store drug stocks. Thus, these have been defined as the critical loads of the system. The components sizes have been optimized by considering both economic profitability but also the resilience capacity, observing that, by installing solar photovoltaic modules, Li-ion batteries and diesel generators, according to simulations performed in REopt® software, the microgrid could save approximately $ 440,191 on average over a 20-year life cycle of the facility (both considering the mitigation of energy provide by the power grid and the avoided losses during probable power services interruptions), while increasing the minimum resilience of the installation more than 34 h.",

The aim is to minimize the operation costs and the voltage deviation of the distribution network, managing simultaneously both the active and reactive resources.

As a result, electricity can be easily purchased and sold across further areas and countries. On the other hand, trying to guarantee renewable projects profitability, Power Purchase Agreements and Options contracts are arising as a feasible solution. The problem arises when the power plant owners have to negotiate the purchase electricity price in order to optimize risks and profits, as well as make future plans. Thus, several methods for Electricity Price Forecasting (EPF) have been developed and presented, showing different results, as market spot prices suffer from strong seasonality, spikes and high volatility. In this paper, three methods, based on Deep Learning Dynamic Neural Networks (NAR, NARX and LSTM) applied to forecast MIBEL electricity spot prices are discussed in order to evaluate their adequacy, accuracy and reliable horizon.",

      "abstract": "Solar photovoltaic (PV) plants coupled with storage for domestic self-consumption purposes seem to be a promising technology in the next years, as PV costs have decreased significantly, and national regulations in many countries promote their installation in order to relax the energy requirements of power distribution grids. However, electrochemical storage systems are still unaffordable for many domestic users and, thus, the advantages of self-consumption PV systems are reduced. Thus, in this work the adoption of hydrogen systems as energy vectors between a PV plant and the energy user is proposed. As a preliminary study, in this work the design of a PV and hydrogen-production self-consumption plant for a single dwelling is described. Then, a technical and economic feasibility study conducted by modeling the facility within the Homer Energy Pro energy systems analysis tool is reported. The proposed system will be able to provide back not only electrical energy but also thermal energy through a fuel cell or refined water, covering the fundamental needs of the householders (electricity, heat or cooling and water). Results show that, although the proposed system effectively increases the energy local use of the PV production and reduces significantly the energy injections or demands into/from the power grid, avoiding power grid congestions and increasing the nano-grid resilience, operation and maintenance costs may reduce its economic attractiveness for a single dwelling.",

      "abstract": "In recent decades, many EU and national regulations have been issued in order to increase the energy efficiency in different sectors and, consequently, to reduce environmental pollution. In the building sector, energy efficiency interventions are usually based on the use of innovative insulated materials and on the installation of cogeneration and tri-generation units, as well as solar technologies. New and retrofitted buildings are more and more commonly being called \"smart buildings\", since they are characterized by the installation of electric and thermal power generation units, energy storage systems, and flexible loads; the presence of such technologies determines the necessity of installing Building Energy Management Systems (BEMSs), which are used to optimally manage their operation. The present paper proposes a BEMS for a smart building, equipped with plants based on renewables (photovoltaics, solar thermal panels, and geothermal heat pump), where the heating and cooling demand are satisfied by a Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning System (HVAC) fed by a geothermal heat pump. The developed BEMS is composed of two different modules: An optimization tool used to optimally manage the HVAC plant, in order to guarantee a desired level of comfort inside rooms, and a simulation tool, based on an equivalent electric circuit model and used to evaluate the thermal dynamic behavior of the building. The paper describes the two modules and shows the main results of the validation phase that has been conducted on a real test-case represented by the Smart Energy Building (SEB) located at the Savona Campus of the University of Genoa, Italy.",

The microgrid infrastructure integrates different technologies to satisfy the electrical, thermal and cooling demand of the site, among which an important role is played by the cogeneration AE T100 microturbines developed by the company. In the paper, the optimization tool AEN-MGD, developed to optimally design and operate the microgrid, is described and different possible configurations of the microgrid are investigated and analysed from the technical, economic and environmental point of view. The proposed model has a general validity and it can be used to design and operate other similar energy infrastructures.",

      "abstract": "A microgrid can be considered a profitable solution to be adopted in smart cities if it is marketable, i.e. more, or at least equally convenient than other traditional energy supply sources. Different economic parameters can be defined to determine its affordability. In particular, the LCOE (Levelized Cost of Electricity) is the most popular indicator adopted in the energy sector, widely used both for conventional and renewable power sources. However, the use of this metric still disregards important aspects that concerns microgrid applications. After providing a state-of-the-art of the use of LCOE, the present paper proposes a new methodology for sustainable microgrids in smart city, taking into account benefits due to cogeneration and trigeneration, integration costs as well as positive and negative side effects.",

      "abstract": "Reactive power sharing is one of the main issues in the control and operation of an autonomous Microgrids (MGs), especially for MGs composed by power generation interfaced with the MG distribution by means of Power Electronic Converters (PEC). Among the various MG control techniques, the droop is the one that has been widely applied thanks to the possibility of achieving a communication-less regulation of the MG. However some issues arises as far as reactive power and voltage control is concerned. The aim of this study is to draw some analytical consideration of reactive power sharing in droop-controlled autonomous MGs in order to highlight the parameters and configuration that can lead to undesired operational conditions.",

The idea is to transform the Savona Campus in a Living Lab of the City of the Future: smart technologies in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and energy sectors were installed in order to show a real application of the Smart City concept to population and external stakeholders. Moreover, special attention was given to the environment, personal wellbeing, and social equalities. The sustainable energy Research Infrastructures (RIs) of Savona Campus allowed enhancement of the applied research in degree programs and the collaboration with several companies. In particular, an important partnership with the Italian electric Distribution System Operator (DSO), ENEL S.p.A., started in 2017 to test the capability of these RIs to operate disconnected from the National Grid, relying only on the supply of renewables and storage systems. The \"Living Lab Smart City\" is an important action to reduce the carbon footprint of the Savona Campus and to increase the awareness of students, teachers and researchers towards Sustainable Development in Higher Education Institutes.",

A hub has to be designed in order to guarantee a mobility service that allows people to move in the most effective way, providing them an efficient network of means of transport, and permitting tourists to exploit as best as possible all the landmarks and attractions of the area where it is located. The aim of this work is to evaluate the case study of Abano Terme city, in the North of Italy, where both the railway station and the public transport system need to be enhanced to offer a better service to tourists visiting the territory. Using the concept of hub and evaluating the actual transport demand, some possible solutions to the problem are proposed and described, in order to improve the transport services of the city. The aforesaid proposal is based on the sustainability concept and on the use of smart mobility systems where electric buses and car sharing services are adopted to reduce emissions and primary energy consumptions.",

The main decision variables of the model are the number and typology of wind turbines and cogeneration plants, the size of photovoltaic fields and the power exchange with the public grid. The optimal values of the variables come from the minimization of installation, maintenance and operational costs, and satisfy load and technical constraints. The model is applied to three districts in the Savona Municipality that represent pilot sites of an extended project concerning the planning and management of smart urban areas.

Sodium/Nickel chloride batteries are considered optimal storage systems, due to their limited environmental impact, high reliability and specific energy, and reduced maintenance. The present paper describes a mathematical model elaborated to calculate the electrical parameters, during the discharge phase, of a Sodium/Nickel chloride galvanic cell contained within an electrical storage system designed for smart grid applications. Some results of the model have been compared with values achieved in experimental tests carried out on the FZSoNick electrical storage batteries of the Genoa University Smart Polygeneration Microgrid.",

Electric Vehicles (EVs) contribute to lower the GHG emissions as they produce no exhaust gas as opposed to internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. The present study has been developed within a research project focused on the use of EVs in sustainable districts to analyze different scenarios applied to a University Campus in the North of Italy, where EVs are charged within a smart microgrid composed of RES power plants, high-efficiency cogeneration units and storage systems. The study aims at fostering the diffusion of the concept of smart mobility, that becomes particularly profitable in sustainable districts where the distributed generation concept is also applied. Furthermore, the proposed methodology can be easily implemented to analyze other similar test-cases, where sustainable districts are fed by the aforesaid energy infrastructures.",

The approach aims at finding the optimal mix and sizing of the generation units to be installed in a number of sites, given the characteristics of each location in terms of radiation, wind potential, electrical and thermal loads, etc. Both dispatchable and renewable (non-dispatchable) energy sources are taken into account; in particular, in the present application the sources considered for installation include cogeneration microturbines, photovoltaic plants and wind turbines. As both renewable sources and loads are stochastic in nature, a proper approach is used to evaluate the effects of the related uncertainties. The proposed model is applied to a neighborhood in Savona, Italy. The goal of the technique is to represent a tool for a decision maker when planning investments in different urban areas, in the context of the transition from a traditional city to a 'smart' one.",

      "abstract": "The increasing penetration of variable and unpredictable renewable energy sources into the liberalized electricity market brings about significant changes in the management strategies of fossil fuel power plants. These new operation modes cause remarkable effects on the lifetime of the plants. Consequently, the operators of the plants need to be assisted by effective procedures, which are able to define suitable production plans. In the present paper, the authors propose a dynamic model which can be used to estimate the effects of the variations of thermodynamic and mechanical parameters during transient operation, start-ups and shut-downs. To check the effectiveness of the model, a combined cycle plant with a three-pressure level heat recovery steam generator has been selected. The geometry of the components, the influence of the environmental conditions, and the control strategies are included in the model. In this way, the residual lifetime of the most critical components can be predicted.",

      "abstract": "Electric mobility is assuming a central role in the new world energy scenario where Renewable Energy Sources (RES) have increased their contribution to the electricity production, mainly due to the fact they are characterized by a reduced environmental impact; in the aforesaid context, Electric Vehicles (EVs) can play a significant role to facilitate the integration of RES into the power grid, also within smart grid infrastructures. Public administration represents one of the sectors that can mostly benefit from the use of the EV technology in its fleets; in many countries, governments have introduced incentive policies to support the spread of the electric mobility and car manufacturers are developing EVs for urban transportation users. In this paper, the attention is focused on a smart microgrid project developed at the University of Genoa and based on the integration of RES, EVs and storage systems. In particular, the attention is here pointed on the use of the EVs to highlight the different habits of recharge adopted at the Genoa University. The paper describes the smart microgrid test-bed facility at the Savona Campus and reports the most significant results relative to an experimental campaign conducted on EVs.",

      "abstract": "Microturbines represent a suitable technology to be adopted in smart microgrids since they are characterized by affordable capital and maintenance costs, high reliability and flexibility, and low environmental impact; moreover, they can be fed by fossil fuels or biofuels. They can operate in cogeneration and trigeneration mode, thus permitting to attain high global efficiency values of the energy conversion system from primary energy to electrical and thermal energy; from the electrical point of view, microturbines can operate connected to the distribution grid but also in islanded mode, thus enabling their use in remote areas without electrification. The paper describes the mathematical model that has been developed to simulate in off-design and transient conditions the operation of a 65 kW<inf>el</inf>cogeneration microturbine installed within a smart microgrid. The dynamic simulation model is characterized by a flexible architecture that permits to simulate other different size single-shaft microturbines. The paper reports the main equations of the model, focusing on the architecture of the simulator and the microturbine control system; furthermore the most significant results derived from the validation phase are reported too, referring to the microturbine installed in the Smart Polygeneration Microgrid of the Savona Campus at the University of Genoa in Italy.",

When the electrical grid is considered, it is necessary to guarantee an electrical demand in each time interval of a single day while the decisions related to installation have to be considered for the whole life time of generation units. In this work, a decision model is proposed for the planning of the energy production in a smart grid feeding a smart district. Specifically, the considered system is characterized by wind turbines, photovoltaic plants, cogeneration micro-turbines, boilers and a connection to the electrical grid. The input parameters of the available renewable resources, the electrical and thermal demands have been estimated on the basis of real data. The proposed model has been applied to a neighborhood in Savona, Italy. The proposed tool is aimed at supporting a central decision maker in planning investments in different urban areas, in the context of the transition from a traditional city to a \"smart\" one.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, the optimization of a microgrid operating in a 'urban district-like' environment is considered, combining both the optimal scheduling of the microgrid sources and demand response strategies, implemented in the district buildings. In particular, the overall system is optimized in order to schedule generation plants, storage systems, electrical vehicles, deferrable and variable loads with the minimum daily operating costs, taking also into account network constraints. Binary and auxiliary variables have been used to reduce the nonlinearity of the model. Moreover, a technique based on Model Predictive Control (MPC) is proposed to minimize uncertainties coming from renewable resources and to reduce the complexity of the overall decision problem solution. The proposed approach has been developed exploiting, as a reference and practical test-case, the Savona Campus of the Genoa University, where the research infrastructure Smart Polygeneration Microgrid (SPM) is in operation; day-ahead optimization results have been compared with those of the proposed MPC approach.",

      "abstract": "In the framework of the 2020 European strategy, that aims the EU to become a smart, sustainable and inclusive economy, several innovative and cost-effective research and development projects are centered on the smart microgrid and sustainable energy concepts. Moreover, the need to develop energy management systems, that permit to operate energy infrastructures in an eco-friendly and sustainable manner, becomes a fundamental prerogative. To this aim, in the present paper a mathematical model is proposed for the optimal daily operation of a sustainable energy infrastructure consisting in a smart electrical and thermal microgrid feeding a smart university campus, such as that located in the city of Savona in Italy; in the paper the main equations of the multi-objective optimization model are reported, as well as some significant results.",

      "abstract": "In this work, the application of an original distributed optimal power flow method to test a microgrid in the Savona area, Italy is proposed. The microgrid shows different types of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) and is connected to the main grid through a fixed power bus. Due to the high computational speed, the applied distributed Optimal Power Flow can be performed almost in real time, i.e. every 5 minutes or less. The operating solution found for generators, simply using local information, corresponds to a suboptimal condition with reduced losses, bus voltages and line currents within constrained intervals. The distributed optimization algorithm is iterative, but also fast. It is based on the use of Kirchhoff and simplified power flow equations and heuristic rules and can be employed for islanded and grid connected medium or small networks. Test results on a real world test system, the Savona Campus \"Smart Polygeneration Microgrid\" (SPM), prove that a few iterations are enough to converge to a sub-optimal solution.",

The analysis includes the evaluation of operational costs and CO<inf>2</inf> emissions, and is carried out in two steps: firstly, the quantification of the economic and environmental benefits provided by the SPM and the SEB on a yearly timescale is determined. Then, the same analysis has been done on a short-term horizon by the use of an optimization algorithm included in the SPM supervisory software. Such a model minimizes an objective function related to daily operational costs and includes the SPM electric and thermal power plants and loads, the distributed heating network, an active building (SEB) and the ICT system responsible for the operational management of the whole research infrastructures. The results of the analysis and the performed experimental research contribute to develop a set of Key Performances Indicators (KPIs) suitable for the smart microgrid concept deployment.",

EU governmental policies encourage the spread of efficient and clean technologies in the energy sector, supporting distributed generation, cogeneration and trigeneration, as well as the exploitation of renewable sources. Furthermore, smart microgrid and energy storage systems have acquired more and more importance in the last years. Within this context, the DESOD (Distributed Energy System Optimal Design) tool, described in the present paper, has been developed at the University of Genoa. DESOD is based on a mixed-integer linear programming model to optimally design and operate a distributed energy system which provides heating, cooling and electricity to an urban neighborhood. In the paper, the model is described in detail and the results derived from its application to a real test case are discussed; a computational analysis of the model is reported as well.",

      "abstract": "The liberalization of the European energy markets combined with the rapid spread of unpredictable renewable energy sources have stressed the need of improving the traditional power units flexibility. Fast start-ups/shut downs and rapid load variations have become priority objectives because they guarantee high profits in the short term but cause a lifetime reduction due to thermo-mechanical fatigue, creep and corrosion. To this purpose, in the present work, an innovative procedure, able to predict the power plant dynamic behaviour during load variations, identify the most stressed components and estimate their lifetime reduction is presented and tested. Being combined cycles the most efficient, flexible and widespread technologies, the selected test case is a 380. MW combined cycle unit. To predict the plant dynamic performance a dynamic model has been built in Modelica language and several transient conditions investigated. The high pressure steam drum and superheater are the most stressed components. Results show a 52.9% reduction in superheater collectors life if the load variation is 50% faster than the reference case. On the contrary, a 35.8% lifetime increase is observed if the load variation is 50% slower. For the same conditions the high pressure steam drum life is reduced by 31.9% and increased by 16.3%, respectively. Also the superheater tube bank lifetime reduction is computed. The proposed procedure can be considered a valuable innovative tool to assist power plant designers and operators.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents ongoing research activities and technology upgrades carried out by the Power System Research team of the University of Genoa on the Smart City test-bed facilities installed at the Savona Campus. These facilities consist of a Smart Polygeneration Microgrid (SPM) feeding the Campus, of a Smart Energy Building (SEB) connected to the SPM and acting as a \"prosumer\" and of an Energy Management System (EMS) controlling the Campus generating units and thermal and electrical loads. The SPM, initially set up as a grid-tied system, is now subjected to further improvements in order to be operated in islanded mode. The paper shows that all the aforementioned infrastructures constitute a real example of how to build a sustainable smart city.",

      "abstract": "The energy markets deregulation coupled with the rapid spread of unpredictable energy sources power units are stressing the necessity of improving traditional power plants flexibility. Cyclic operation guarantees high profits in the short term but, in the medium-long time, cause a lifetime reduction due to thermo-mechanical fatigue, creep and corrosion. In this context, Combined Cycle Power Plants are the most concerned in flexible operation problems. For this reason, two research groups from two Italian universities have developed a procedure to estimate the devices lifetime reduction with a particular focus on steam drums and superheaters/reheaters. To assess the lifetime reduction, it is essential to predict the thermodynamic variables trend in order to describe the plant behaviour. Therefore, the core of the procedure is the power plant dynamic model. At this purpose, in this paper, three different dynamic models of the same single pressure Combined Cycle Gas Turbine are presented. The models have been built using three different approaches and are used to simulate plant behaviour under real operating conditions. Despite these differences, the thermodynamic parameters time profiles are in good accordance as presented in the paper. At last, an evaluation of the drum lifetime reduction is performed.",

The electric grid is a three phase low voltage distribution system, connecting many different technologies: three cogeneration micro gas turbines fed by natural gas, a photovoltaic field, three cogeneration Concentrating Solar Powered (CSP) systems (equipped with Stirling engines), an absorption chiller equipped with a storage tank, two types of electrical storage based on batteries technology (long term Na-Ni and short term Li-Ion ion), two electric vehicles charging stations, other electrical devices (inverters and smart metering systems), etc. The EMS can be used both for microgrids approximated as single bus bar (or one node) and for microgrids in which all buses are taken into account. The optimal operation of the microgrid is based on a central controller that receives forecasts and data from a SCADA system and that can schedule all dispatchable plants in the day ahead or in real time through an approach based on Model Predictive Control (MPC).

      "abstract": "In the recent years the flexibility of fossil-fuel power plants has become of primary importance since the competitiveness of the electricity market imposes to such plants to be characterized by short run times and fast cycling, not only to be competitive but also to compensate for fluctuating renewable sources. Cyclic operations guarantee high profits in the short term but cause a reduction in the lifetime due to thermo-mechanical fatigue, creep and corrosion effects in the medium-long time. In this context, combined cycle power plants fed by natural gas are the most concerned in flexible operation problems. Two research groups have developed a procedure to estimate the devices residual life reduction, focusing in particular on the most stressed components, such as steam drums and superheaters. The procedure can be utilized for planning the power production and scheduling maintenance interventions. For estimating the life reduction, due to cycling, it is essential to foresee the trends of the main thermodynamic parameters (such as mass flow rates, temperatures and pressures) that describe the plant behavior. Therefore, the core of the procedure is the power plant dynamic model. At this purpose, in this paper, three different models of the same single pressure combined cycle power plant are presented. The models have been built using three different approaches and, at the present time, they are used by the two research groups to simulate the plant under real operating conditions. To analyze the plant behavior, different transient conditions are simulated. Despite the difference in how the models solve the problem and represent the geometry of the components, the obtained time profiles of the thermodynamic parameters are in good accordance as accurately described in the paper. At last, an evaluation of the residual life of the drum is presented as a function of pressure and temperature variations which cause thermal and mechanical stress, namely thermo-mechanical fatigue.",

Such microgrid is designed to produce electric and thermal energy by means of renewable generation units, cogenerative gas turbines, a storage unit and electric vehicle charging stations. The work focuses its attention on the issue of the microgrid day-ahead power production optimization. Such problem consists in finding the power production profiles for all the dispatchable units in order to optimize a well-defined goal (economical, environmental, etc). This requires to model all the components of the grid in order to define the set of constraints for the optimization procedure. In particular, the way of representing the electric power balance equations plays a crucial role since a trade-off between accuracy and computational efforts is required. Different approaches are presented and tested on the SPM, e.g. complete load flow, modified DC load flow and single bus-bar representation, in order to highlight the peculiarity of the different optimization models obtained and evaluate their impact on computational time, result accuracy and possibility of future experimental validation.",

      "abstract": "The deregulated energy market and the increasing quota of electrical capacity covered by non-predictable renewable sources require strongly irregular and discontinuous operation of thermoelectric plants to satisfy users demand and compensate the variability of renewable sources. As a consequence, due to thermo-mechanical fatigue, creep and corrosion, a lifetime reduction of the most critical components occurs. The availability of a procedure able to predict the residual life of plant devices is necessary to assist the management decisions about power plants' operation and maintenance scheduling. The first step of this procedure is the capability of simulating the plant behaviour versus time by evaluating the trends of the main thermodynamic parameters that describe the plant operation during different transient periods. In this context, the main contribution of the present paper is to propose a complete procedure able to simulate the plant dynamic behaviour and estimate the residual life reduction of some components. Indeed, two different models, developed by two different research groups, of the same single pressure heat recovery steam generator unit are presented and utilized to characterize the dynamic behaviour of the above mentioned power plant. The main thermodynamic variables during different transient operation conditions are predicted and good correspondence between the two methods is obtained. It can be also noted that, when the geometry and size of the devices are considered, the thermal inertia related to heat exchangers tubes, pipes and other physical masses causes a delay in the system response. Moreover, a residual life estimation of the most stressed component is presented.",

      "abstract": "The present paper is focused on the analysis of a typical small size electric steam generator (3.45 kW installed in machines operating in laundries for ironing activities. A mathematical model has been developed to study the dynamic behavior of the steam generator in different operating conditions, in order to evaluate the main thermodynamic and physical quantities (pressure, temperature, flow rate, etc.) which describe its operation, as a function of time. The mathematical model has been implemented by using the software Matlab/Simulink. The present paper describes both the mathematical model and the simulator, focusing on the analysis of the control system and reporting the most significant results of the study, that has been carried out also taking into account data from experimental tests. The simulator permits to analyze how different ironing cycles influence the water level and the pressure within the steam generator. Furthermore, the analysis aims also to quantify the electricity and water consumptions, for different operating conditions, in order to give some suggestions on how to optimize ironing cycles. For the aforementioned reasons, the simulator can be considered a useful tool for both users and manufacturers that operate in the ironing machine sector. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

      "abstract": "The continuous spread of DER (Distributed Energy Resource) systems and CHCP (Combined Heat, Cooling and Power) technologies around the world highlights critical issues concerning the management strategies of such complex energy infrastructures. The concept of SG (Smart Grid) could be the solution to these problems even if nowadays there are not so many ongoing research and development applications that demonstrate the effective economic and environmental benefits consequent to exploiting smart grid technologies. Therefore, it is essential to develop, both in civil and industrial applications, smart grid/microgrid test-bed facilities where the synergy of new equipment, advanced management systems and ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) can determine advantages in terms of operational cost reduction, primary energy saving and CO<inf>2</inf> emission decrease. The present paper describes the main components of the SPM (Smart Polygeneration Microgrid) of the Genoa University located at the Savona Campus. The paper is focused on a mathematical model developed to optimally manage the SPM in order to minimize daily operational costs. The optimal results are reported also pointing the attention on CO<inf>2</inf> emission reduction and primary energy saving consequent to the optimal operation of the SPM in comparison with the current reference scenario not based on the distributed generation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

      "abstract": "The present paper is focused on the optimization of combined heat and power distributed generation systems. In particular, the authors describe a mixed-integer linear programming model that has been developed in order to optimally design and operate an energy system in a limited urban area where buildings are equipped with small-size CHP plants and are connected by a heat distribution network; in the proposed model a multi-objective function is optimized, since capital and operating costs, as well as CO<inf>2</inf> emissions, are taken into account. The model has a general validity even if the results reported in the present paper are relative to the case study represented by a residential and tertiary district in the city of Arenzano in the North of Italy. Furthermore, a comparative study has been done in order to quantify the benefits, in terms of economic saving and CO<inf>2</inf> emission reduction, of having a combined heat and power distributed generation system in buildings in spite of using boilers to produce heat and of buying electricity from the grid. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, as set by the EU 20-20-20 targets, the reduction of primary energy use and greenhouse gas emissions in the energy sector can be attained by increasing the use of renewable sources and improving energy efficiency. Many national and international research programs are aiming at developing innovative technologies and new energy management strategies in order to reach the targets set out in the 20-20-20 directive. In this context, a primary role is played by the Distributed Generation (DG), which refers to the electrical and thermal generation located near to the place of use, exploiting available renewable sources. One of the best way to exploit the emerging potential of DG is to take a system approach which views generation and associated loads as a whole concept called microgrid. The sources can operate in parallel to the grid or can operate in island, providing utility power station services. Utilization of waste heat from the sources will increase total efficiency, making the polygeneration microgrid more financially attractive and smart from the energy consumption standpoint. The smartness is also in the management system, where control strategies aiming at the optimization of technical, economical and environmental issues are typically implemented. This paper deals with smart microgrids, addressing basically the following topics: (1) to review methods, models, tools, technologies and research challenges in the specific field; (2) to present the University of Genoa Smart Polygeneration Microgrid (SPM), built with the financial contribution of the Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research at the decentralized Savona Campus facilities. The SPM produces energy at low emissions for the University and operates as a test-bed facility for research, testing and development of smart grid components. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

      "abstract": "The present study is relative to the dynamic simulation of heat recovery steam generators. In particular, the study is focused on the development of simulation models able to calculate thermal and mechanical stresses and, as a consequence, the low-cycle fatigue damage of high pressure steam drums in combined cycle systems. The paper describes the mathematical model that the author has developed to estimate the useful life reduction of the high pressure steam drum belonging to a three pressure levels heat recovery steam generator. The aim of the present study is to propose a detailed calculation procedure useful to electrical energy producers that want to predict the steam drums useful life reduction, due to different transient operating conditions, in order to optimize plant load cycles. The steam drum life reduction has been evaluated following the guidelines proposed by the EN 13445 Standard, and subjecting the uniaxial equivalent stress to the \"rainflow cycle counting method\" reported by the ASTM E 1049 Standard. As described in the paper, one of the innovations introduced by the author to apply the EN 13445 Standard is relative to the analytical method proposed to calculate the allowable number of fatigue cycles without using iterative formulas. Furthermore, it is important to say that the calculation tool can be used to estimate the life consumption of any steam drum of a combined cycle power plant; the model is characterized by low run times and high reliability. In fact, it has been successfully tested and validated taking into account experimental data from real power plants; the paper reports some calculation results that refer to typical transient operating conditions.",

      "abstract": "The paper aims to contribute to a better understanding of the thermodynamic concept of heat regeneration in steam power plants with a finite number of bleedings. A regenerative Rankine cycle is compared to a complex system (CHC - complete hybrid cycle) composed by one non-regenerative Rankine cycle (HEC - hybrid engine cycle) and more reverse cycles (RCs - reverse cycles), as many as the number of the bleedings, able to pump heat from the condenser to a series of surface feedwater heaters, disposed upstream of the steam plant boiler. The COPs (coefficients of performance) of the heat pumps are evaluated, and new interesting formulations of the efficiency of the regenerative steam cycle are proposed. In particular a steam cycle with two bleedings is analyzed, neglecting heat losses and pressure drops in the boiler and considering irreversibility only along the expansion line of the steam turbine and into the feedwater heaters. The efficiency and the work of the regenerative cycle are compared to the analogous values of the CHC cycle composed by one simple steam cycle (HEC) and two heat pump cycles (RCs), with steam as the working fluid. The two reverse cycles are considered completely reversible and raising heat from the condenser temperature to the bled steam condensing temperature. The paper shows the most significant results of the study in order to analyze the regenerative cycle and the CHC cycle in comparison with the non-regenerative Rankine cycle; in particular, the analysis is focused on the evaluation of the useful work, the heat supplied and the heat rejected for the examined cycles. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

Both simulators derive from a finite differences model based on the discretization of the Fourier's heat conduction equation but are characterized by a different Simulink structure; their main output is the temperature and the thermo-mechanical stress distribution inside the metal of a steam drum. Owing to their short runtimes and flexibility, the two simulators can be linked with the real-time dynamic simulation model of the combined cycle power plant and can be used to evaluate the plant life consumption due to transient operating conditions which determine high thermo-mechanical stresses in metal components. Then the paper reports on some simulation results concerning the models validation phase and the analysis of typical transient operating conditions of a combined cycle power plant.",

To this end, a mathematical model has been developed for determining the optimal steam pressure in a one pressure level heat recovery steam generator, considering that the gas turbine is known. Different objective functions have been analysed in this study, some of which refer only to the exergy balance of the heat recovery steam generator while others involve the whole bottoming cycle. Some constraints for the operating parameters of the power plant have also been taken into account, regarding for instance the steam quality at the turbine outlet and the steam turbine blade height. Some numerical results have been reported in the paper, comparing the different objective functions for heat recovery steam generators coupled with several gas turbines; the developed parametric analysis has been performed in order to evaluate the influence of some parameters on both the heat recovery steam generator and the whole bottoming cycle. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",

The paper describes the main features of air-cooled condensers, showing the problems related to their use, such as the presence of non-condensable gases inside the steam flow or the condenser performances variability due to ambient conditions. The present study refers to A-frame air-cooled condensers characterized by single-pass and multiple-row arrangement. A phenomenological study has been done in order to calculate the main physical parameters which describe the condenser operating conditions. In particular, three mathematical models have been developed: while both the first and the second model consider a condenser with tubes characterized by the same finned surface, with or without the use of throttling valves upstream of each tube, the third model examines the behaviour of a condenser with different row effectiveness. The three mathematical models permit one also to investigate the possible vapour back flow inside each row of tubes, by calculating the axial coordinate value along each tube at which the condensing steam mass flow rate becomes null; the third mathematical model has been implemented in the Matlab/Simulink environment in order to couple the simulator of the condenser with the whole plant simulation model. © 2009 WIT Press.",

The simulator can predict the internal working parameters for both exhaust gas and steam by evaluating the heat balances between exhaust gas and water/steam in the HRSG. The boiler model has been included in the whole plant dynamic simulator so that it is possible to plot the most important output variables as the gas and steam electrical power outputs and the plant global efficiency, in steady-state and transient conditions.
