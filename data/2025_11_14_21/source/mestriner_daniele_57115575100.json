Lightning data were obtained from a lightning location system (the SIRF network) and processed to focus exclusively on cloud-to-ground (CG) strokes. The analysis covers both land and surrounding sea areas, with data filtered and validated according to the study objectives. A detailed statistical comparison of CG activity between the two periods is presented, along with an assessment of spatial distributions across the Italian territory. Furthermore, correlations between CG stroke occurrence and both sea surface temperature and land surface temperature are examined. The findings highlight temporal and spatial variations in lightning patterns over the decade and provide insights into their possible relationship with environmental conditions.",

      "abstract": "Lightning-induced voltages significantly contribute to flashovers in medium-voltage (MV) overhead distribution lines. These voltages, generated by the electromagnetic fields of nearby lightning strikes, pose a substantial risk to system reliability and operational safety. The magnitude of these induced voltages strongly depends on the surrounding environment, particularly on the presence and characteristics of nearby objects. Nearby objects can influence the voltage waveform across pole insulators, either by altering its shape or attenuating its intensity. This study investigates the specific impact of the presence of air gaps between adjacent buildings on the induced voltage along MV lines placed in urban areas. By comparing scenarios involving separated buildings to those where a single continuous structure is considered, the research highlights how the structural configuration affects the line's susceptibility to electromagnetic fields. To evaluate the impact, simulations are conducted using a Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method-based solver. This computational approach enables detailed analysis of both the spatial variations in electric field strength and the temporal evolution of the induced voltage along the line. The results provide insights into the electromagnetic interactions between the distribution lines and their surrounding structures, offering valuable information for optimizing the design and layout of MV distribution systems to mitigate lightning-induced hazards.",

      "abstract": "Lightning is a major risk for humans, animals, and electrical systems. Many researches focused on the fully developed events, such as the Return Stroke (RS) current, the emitted electromagnetic fields, and the phenomenon modeling. However, there is poor understanding regarding precursors, such as Preliminary Breakdown Pulses (PBP). PBP are the pulses before the first RS. Studying these pulses provides understanding into the initial event that triggers the process within the cloud. Sufficient measurement data and a reliable model of PBP help to forecast the lightning flash development and help creating effective protection systems, ultimately enhancing the safety and reliability of electrical infrastructure and minimizing the risk of damage from lightinings. The aim of this paper is to conduct an extensive literature review to identify sources of measured data of PBP and the available modeling methods. The first part provides a review of key existing experimental studies, discussing aspects such as measurement equipment, signals, data, identification algorithms, and statistical observations. The second part discusses the methods available for modeling PBP categorized into descriptive and physical models. Descriptive models focus on reconstructing the primary PBP features from measured data, while physical models aim to explore the underlying physical mechanisms of PBPs.",

The hybrid electromagnetic model is considered to model the grounding system for the distribution poles. The representations of other system elements are considered those typically recommended in the IEEE Standard 1410. The lightning-induced voltages across the insulator strings are estimated based on the Agrawal model, and the outage rate is assessed by means of the Monte Carlo method. Additionally, analysis considering protective techniques, such as implementing shield wires and surge arresters, is taken into account.

      "abstract": "The electromagnetic fields (EMFs) produced by a lightning discharge are usually computed by supposing a vertical channel. However, the tortuous path of channels represents a realistic feature of lightning strikes and can drastically modify the radiated EMFs. Numerical methods for their computation have been developed, mainly based on the superposition law as applied to consecutive rectilinear segments, properly oriented in order to create a tortuous path; however, such methods require a high computational effort, which may be unfeasible for realistic problems. As an alternative approach, this work introduces an equivalent tortuous function, which aims at taking into account the channel tortuosity in the EMF expressions produced by a vertical channel. The proposed function is obtained as the regularized solution of an appropriate inverse problem, and is validated against several tortuous lightning channels.",

      "abstract": "The number of HVDC plants is continuously increasing, basically due to practical reasons -i.e. frequent impossibility to develop a terrestrial routing- and to the better exploitation of renewable energy sources. Therefore, the number of sea return electrodes increases, and the risk of damage due to impact with objects such as anchors and fishing nets becomes more probable. One issue that should be analyzed is thus the overall structural resistance of offshore sea electrodes to such kinds of events. Of course, electrode module weight has a significant impact on the time and cost of electrode laying, so it is necessary to find a good compromise between these two conflicting requirements. This paper is aimed at providing an overview of the main arising issues and of the guidelines that can be followed.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a new alternative approach for estimating the lightning performance of overhead distribution lines by combining the Unscented Transform method with the Monte Carlo method. The partial application of the Unscented Transform method, a mathematical tool that discretizes probability density functions, significantly reduces the number of simulations required for lightning performance assessments. The proposed hybrid approach is compared to the traditional one, which relies solely on the Monte Carlo method, with both approaches applied within a computational tool to estimate the lightning performance, considering both direct and indirect lightning strikes. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach can provide similar lightning performance estimates as the traditional method but with greater computational efficiency.",

      "abstract": "This article presents a new method to solve the inverse problem of reconstructing the lightning return-stroke current from measurements of the radiated magnetic field. Although the lightning channel is still assumed to be straight, vertical, and at a known distance from the sensors measuring the fields, no model or channel-base measurement of the current is required, so that, unlike previous approaches to this kind of inverse problem, several assumptions on the current propagation along the channel can be dropped. The method is formulated in the frequency domain and is based on a double Fourier series (DFS) representation of the unknown current as a function of two variables, i.e., the vertical coordinate and the frequency. The theoretical investigation results in an inversion algorithm, which is tested against simulated data in order to obtain some examples of current reconstruction.",

      "abstract": "The electric fields radiated by a lightning discharge may represent an important source of damage for electric and electronic equipment. Often, an analysis of such fields in the frequency domain is necessary and their frequency-domain expressions have always been evaluated by considering an infinite time-window and omitting the zero-frequency term coming from the static component of the fields. This work shows that, in order to take into proper account such component, the classical expressions of the electric fields in the frequency domain should be modified by including a distributional term. This aspect may strongly affect numerical algorithms such as the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), since the agreement between Fourier Transform (FT) and FFT is guaranteed only if the FT is a function. Starting from this issue, the present work proposes new frequency-domain expressions of the radial and vertical electric fields by assuming, more realistically, that the time window in which the fields are measured is finite. As a result, the new FT of each time-windowed field is wholly functional again, but it turns out to be modified with respect to its traditional expression.",

      "abstract": "By relying on suitable propagation models, lightning electromagnetic fields can be computed from the knowledge of the channel-base current (CBC) and of the attenuation function. While the CBC is measured by means of instrumented towers, a parametric attenuation function is usually assumed a priori and then compared with the measured fields in order to find optimal values for the CBC parameters. Unlike this approach, the present paper proposes a methodology for the reconstruction of the attenuation function whereby the latter is obtained as the solution of an inverse problem (while maintaining the same kind of input data). Moreover, for the sake of generality, the framework is formulated by considering possibly short time-windows, so that meaningful information can be recovered even when a complete recording of the lightning discharge process is not available. The inversion method is based on an iterative Tikhonov regularization procedure. The proposed approach is then applied to simulated data of electric and magnetic fields, as well as of CBC current, blurred by numerical noise in the time domain. The resulting algorithm turns out to provide a good accuracy in reconstructing a fictitious attenuation function. Finally, a short sensitivity analysis on the electromagnetic field noise and on the radial distance error is presented.",

      "abstract": "High Voltage Direct Current power links are usually designed to adopt, on a continuous basis or during emergency operations, two grounding plants using the soil or seawater as a link–current return path. Such DCs flowing into the ground can cause problems, of which one of the most important is the increased risk of the corrosion of metallic structures in the area. Normally, the simplest mitigation technique is to keep an adequate distance between the main grounding plants and any metallic structure that can be corroded. Normally, such distances are not less than 5 km. However, there are situations where this approach cannot be applied, for example due to geographical constraints. In this paper, we describe and analyze the behavior of a mitigation technique that can be adopted when the HV pole cable is laid closer than the recommended distance to the main ground electrode. This paper is focused on the minimization of deleterious effects on the cable’s metallic sheath and its earthing points, distributed along it by means of sheath segmentation. The suggested approach appears well-suited to substantially diminishing the current flowing through the sheath of an HVDC power cable. In the segmented scenario, the sheath’s power dissipation is less than one-hundredth of that in the typical continuous configuration.",

      "abstract": "In a recent paper, a procedure to reconstruct the attenuation function of a return-stroke current from the simultaneous measurements of the channel-base current and the radiated electromagnetic fields was presented. One of the assumptions of the whole framework was that the sensors can record the overall time-evolution of the lightning return-stroke, namely from its start to its end. However, this condition is too restrictive for most of the real data collected in the past decades, since they were generally acquired for other goals than the reconstruction of the attenuation function. Accordingly, in the present paper we perform a theoretical investigation aimed at removing such restriction. As a result, we first derive a new set of integral equations that relate the channel-base current to the radiated fields during a generic time-window, then we obtain the corresponding equations in the frequency domain via Fourier Transform, which represent the analytical formulation of an inverse problem to be numerically solved through appropriate regularization techniques.",

      "abstract": "HVDC electrodes are usually implemented in HVDC links to avoid the installation of a metallic return. Submarine cables, especially those dealing with lengths of thousands of kilometers, are expensive, and high costs of laying are normally expected. Due to the high number of reversible HVDC links, the marine electrodes must be able to withstand both anodic and cathodic operations, which leads to careful considerations in terms of the material to be used. This paper shows the state of the art of the currently installed reversible sea return electrodes, focusing on the type of installation (sea, shore or pond electrodes) and on the material used, from the first plant installed in 1954 up to the more recent ones established during the XXI century. All reported data derive from publicly available sources. Moreover, since nowadays environmental issues are among the most important topics, for each material and for each type of installation, a guideline on the possible interferences caused by marine electrodes with the surrounding environment is proposed.",

      "abstract": "Lightning represents one of the most critical issues for electrical infrastructure. In dealing with overhead distribution line systems, indirect lightning strikes can lead to induced voltages overcoming the critical flashover value of the line, thus damaging the insulators. The computation of lightning-induced voltages requires the modeling of the lightning current, the evaluation of the lightning electromagnetic fields and the solution of the field-to-line coupling equations. The numerical calculation of the lightning electromagnetic fields is time-consuming and is strongly dependent on the lightning channel modeling and soil properties. This article presents a review of the most widely adopted methods to calculate the lightning electromagnetic fields, starting from the classical formulation, which requires numerical integration, and highlighting the most effective approaches that have been developed to reduce computational effort. This is done first for the case of a perfectly conducting ground, then the available formulations to account for the ground finite conductivity are presented together with their possible implementations in both the frequency and time domains.",

      "abstract": "The behavior of the return-stroke current along the lightning channel is extremely important for the evaluation of the electromagnetic fields radiated at various distances, since such fields may cause disturbances or faults on electric and electronic equipment. It is commonly known that lightning current attenuates while propagating along the channel and several models have been adopted in an attempt to reproduce the characteristics of the electromagnetic fields at different distances. This work proposes a method that can reconstruct the attenuation of the current along the channel, starting from the knowledge of the channel-base current and of the vertical electric field measured by a sensor located five km away from the discharge location. The method relies upon the Tikhonov regularization technique applied to an ill-posed problem in the frequency domain and is mainly based on the hypothesis of long-time measurement windows.",

In this contribution, a WT transient response to direct lightning strikes is studied with a full-Maxwell approach, involving a complete model for the WT. Simulations are carried out considering both first and subsequent return strokes to one of the rotor blades. Significant reflections are found in the lightning current waveforms through the WT, and this gives rise to amplifications in the radiated electromagnetic fields with respect to ground discharges.",

      "abstract": "Lightning-induced voltages are one of the major causes of flashovers in medium voltage (MV) overhead distribution lines. Their magnitude can strongly be affected by the presence of nearby objects, which could attenuate or modify the waveform of the voltage across the pole insulators. This work presents a study on how having a building close to an overhead line can reduce the peak-value of the induced voltage on the line, considering different distances from the line to the building and different values of the soil conductivity. The reinforcement and the foundation of the building are also considered. The simulations are carried out using a solver based on the FDTD method. The main results include the electric field strength in the analysis space and the ratio of the peak-value of the induced voltage in the presence of the building to the peak-value of the induced voltage without the building. It was observed that the soil conductivity has a significant influence on the attenuation provided by the building. If the soil is highly conductive and the line is at least 200 m away from the building, the effect of the building could be neglected.",

      "abstract": "The electromagnetic lightning field is usually computed by considering a model consisting in a vertical and rectilinear channel, as well as a Transmission-Line (TL) type propagation characterized by an attenuation function, which expresses how the current decreases while it travels upward along the lightning channel. When dealing with realistic channels, affected by tortuosity, the current attenuation is usually neglected and the field computation is cumbersome, since the discretization of the channel in a large number of linear segments has to be performed. This contribution presents an equivalent attenuation function to be used in the computation of vertical channels in order to reproduce the results of a tortuous one. The attenuation function is computed by solving an inverse problem through the Tikhonov regularization technique, and it is found to be reliable for distances larger than 5 km from the lightning channel.",

One of the most important variables is the channel-base current (CBC) waveform, usually measured by means of proper instruments installed on tall towers where the striking probability is higher. However, the presence of the tower itself and the low number of registered events represent a critical issue in the possibility of acquiring a large amount of data. On the other hand, Lightning Location Systems are able to provide a high number of data, but limited to the peak value of the current. This work proposes an algorithm that can reconstruct the CBC from remote measurements of the vertical electric field and/or the azimuthal magnetic field taken during a finite time-window [0, T].",

      "abstract": "Lightning may be the cause of outages and faults on electrical infrastructures. In overhead distribution lines, voltages overcoming the critical flashover value of the line may be induced by indirect lightning strikes, and this fact may cause serious damages to insulators. Consequently, the assessment of induced voltages is an important aspect in the design phase of transmission and distribution lines. To this goal, the lightning current shall be modeled, the electromagnetic fields should be evaluated and the field-to-line coupling equations implemented. In case time dependent functions are considered, the lightning electromagnetic fields may also be numerically approximated, but, usually, such approximation requires significant computational efforts and strongly depend on the way in which the lightning channel is modeled and on the soil properties. The present paper proposes an overview of the most utilized methodologies aiming at numerically or analytically approximating the lightning electromagnetic fields. Under the hypothesis of perfectly conducting ground, the classical formulation, requiring numerical integration is firstly presented. Then, the most effective approaches aiming at reducing computational timings are discussed. Finally, the models available to represent the lightning tortuosity are presented.",

This contribution presents a novel semi-analytical approach for the calculation of lightning electromagnetic fields considering channel tortuosity with an arbitrary current source.

      "abstract": "A correct representation of the lightning current is crucial when the electromagnetic field radiated to a point of interest has to be computed. Based on the engineering models of Transmission Line type, such representation involves the knowledge of the return-stroke speed, the channel-base current, the channel height and the attenuation function. Whereas the first three quantities can be measured in different ways, no measurement technique can directly provide reliable information on the attenuation function. In the past decades, researchers have applied various strategies to address this problem. These strategies are all based on a common feature, i.e., the unknown function is postulated a priori and then validated through the comparison of the computed electromagnetic fields at one or more observation points with the corresponding measured waveforms. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach for the identification of the attenuation function: starting from appropriate measurements of the return-stroke speed, the channel-base current, the channel height and the radiated electromagnetic field, we first formulate an algebraic inverse and ill-posed problem, obtained from the discretization of integral equations relating the source to the radiated field in the frequency domain, and then we solve it by means of a Tikhonov regularization technique. The proposed framework is preceded by a detailed theoretical analysis, with special emphasis on the description and filtering of measurement noise and on the minimum duration of the measurement time-windows ensuring reliable results.",

The procedure considers downward negative first, negative subsequent, and positive return strokes, taking into account the number of strokes per flash (flash multiplicity) and the distance among return stroke impact points within the same flash (stroke terminations distance). The analysis of the effect produced using LLS data on the estimated number of flashovers per year on the test line is achieved by replacing one by one the standard distributions and parameters typically adopted in the literature, with those inferred from the LLS, when they can be considered reliable.

      "abstract": "Lightning electromagnetic (EM) fields are typically computed by assuming the current propagation within a straight vertical channel of negligible cross section. However, it is well known that the lightning path is tortuous and this can significantly affect the radiated fields and the lightning-induced voltages on power lines. Lupò et al. (2000) proposed an analytical method evaluating the EM fields radiated by a tortuous channel assuming a step current source; to consider an arbitrary (realistic) current source, a slow-converging convolution integral was applied. The aim of this article is to reduce the computation time of such procedure by extending to the tortuous channel case the approach proposed by Brignone et al. (2021) for the evaluation of the lightning EM fields with arbitrary current source, originally developed for a straight vertical channel. The performances of the present method are evaluated by means of comparison with the solution proposed by Lupò et al. (2000), showing an excellent agreement with a significant reduction of the CPU effort. This in principle will allow the computation of lightning-induced overvoltages at both individual and statistical level without a prohibitive computational effort.",

      "abstract": "A lightning event striking the sea could induce several damages to the near infrastructures located on the coast. The possible damages are connected to the induced voltages caused by the electromagnetic fields generated by the lightning discharge. In order to compute them, several simplified approaches have been developed, using ideal models for the surrounding geometry and for the electrical parameters of the soil. This works provides the evaluation of the lightning electromagnetic fields generated by a lightning event striking on the sea taking into account the possible elevation of the terrain with respect to the sea level and the inclination of the seabed. The analysis has been carried out taking into account several distances between the coast and the striking location as well as different observation points, in order to evaluate the induced effects on a structure located close to the sea-land interface as well as in a more distant location. The analysis, implemented with the aid of the finite element method, leads to important conclusions on the components of the electric and magnetic field that are more affected by the realistic characteristics of the surrounding orography.",

      "abstract": "Wind turbines (WTs) can beseriously damaged by lightning strikes and they can be struck by a significant number of flashes. This should be taken into account when the WT lightning protection system is designed. Moreover, WTs represent a path for the lightning current that can modify the well-known effects of the lightning discharge in terms of radiated electromagnetic fields, which are a source of damage and interference for nearby structures and systems. In this paper, a WT struck by a lightning discharge is analyzed with a full-wave modelling approach, taking into account the details of the WT and its interactions with the lightning channel. The effects of first and subsequent return strokes are analyzed as well as that of the rotation angle of the struck blade. Results show that the lightning current along the WT is mainly affected by the ground reflection and by the reflection between the struck blade and the channel. The computed electromagnetic fields show that, for subsequent return strokes, the presence of a WT almost doubles their magnitude with respect to a lightning striking the ground. Such enhancement is emphasized when the inclined struck blade is considered.",

      "abstract": "Lightning strikes can seriously affect the reliability and availability of electrical infrastructures. The computation of lightning-electromagnetic fields represents one of the most crucial steps in the evaluation of the induced effects; thus, having at disposal accurate and efficient dedicated tools is essential. This paper proposes a new approach for the lightning-electromagnetic fields computation above a perfectly conducting ground. The proposed approach does not involve any assumption either on the channel-base current waveshape or on the attenuation function of the current along the channel. Integrals are expanded in series of exponential functions (Prony series) which makes them analytically solvable. The proposed approach results in a speed up of the computational time by a factor of 10 to some hundreds with respect to classical numerical approaches. The proposed method is validated against the classical formulas obtained through numerical integration for different channel-base current waveforms, attenuation functions and observation points.",

      "abstract": "The Fourier transform (FT) of the electric field (EF) radiated by a lightning return stroke is shown to include a distributional term at zero frequency, which prevents numerical algorithms, such as fast FT, from working properly. Inspired by the finite duration of any field measurement in real applications, we introduce a time-windowing strategy, whereby the integration time-interval of the FT becomes bounded. As a result, the distributional term is removed from the FT, whereas the functional part of the FT is modified throughout the whole range of frequencies, in such a way that a good performance of the numerical algorithms can be restored. The dependence of the modified spectra of the EFs on the length of the time window is also investigated and three numerical experiments with different channel-base currents are performed to validate the whole resulting framework.",

      "abstract": "Lightning-related phenomena are one of the most dangerous factors affecting the overhead distribution systems. Said that, protective measures to reduce lightning damages are an important issue to guarantee distribution line reliability. The most widely employed protective measures against lightning are: shield wires, surge arresters, and increasing the line insulation level, usually by increasing the length of insulator strings. Among the aforementioned techniques, one that deserves a special attention is installing lightning arresters, since it can be very effective and commonly used in reducing lightning overvoltage. In this way, this paper presents a comparative study of the induced overvoltage calculation along insulator strings due to indirect lightning strikes in the distribution lines with and without the installation of surger arresters and comparing results considering a simple and rigorous modeling of the pole-footing grounding system. Furthermore, a simplified representation of the model of the pole-footing grounding system, in which the surge arresters will be installed, commonly adopted may lead to an underestimation of the overvoltage. The results point that the surge arresters are able to isolate the propagation of the induced voltages in adjacent poles by positioning them at poles in alternate pattern. The maximum voltage difference found when considering the rigorous model instead of the simplified model of the pole-footing grounding system, for the cases studied, was around 6.42%.",

For the correct evaluation of lightning-induced overvoltages, the frequency dependence of the electrical parameters of the soil should be considered. Therefore, this paper proposes a simplified approach which selects a representative frequency according to the front time of the current waveform at the base of the lightning channel and takes advantage of an approximate formula for the lightning-induced overvoltage peak which is available in the literature. The most relevant strengths of the proposed method are the simplicity of implementation and the reduced process time, which is extremely lower than that required by more sophisticated numerical methods. These characteristics make the proposed approach a simple and practical tool. The results show overvoltage decreases above 35 percent for soils of low conductivity. Therefore, the frequency dependence of the electrical parameters of the soil plays an important role.",

Thus, this paper considers the frequency-dependent soil electrical parameters in a previously developed approximate formula for the peak value of lightning-induced overvoltage on overhead lines. This approach consists of using a specific frequency (based on the lightning front time) to estimate the ground conductivity. Since the proposal is easy to implement and fast to run in any computational environment, it is a practical engineering tool.

      "abstract": "Dealing with lightning performance computation, researchers usually consider only negative downward first return strokes and the relevant channel-base peak current distribution. The aim of this article is to account for the lightning flash mechanism, which means to include also downward negative subsequent strokes and downward positive strokes, taking into account available distributions of the number of strokes per flash (i.e., the flash multiplicity) and of the distance among the impact points of the strokes within the same flash (i.e., the channel terminations distance). In this regard, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the present study is the first one taking into account the multiple ground channel terminations in the lightning performance assessment. The obtained results show that both the negative subsequent strokes and multiple channel termination determine a significant increase in the estimated number of flashovers per year, and they need to be considered in the lightning performance assessment. On the other hand, considering positive downward strokes, a less remarkable increase in the estimated number of flashovers per year is observed.",

      "abstract": "This article proposes a method for the derivation of a formula that links the maximum lightning-induced-overvoltage occurring on an overhead distribution line with the variables that characterize the lightning return stroke, such as the peak current, front duration, and stroke location. The coefficients of such formulas are obtained thanks to a limited number of lightning field-to-line coupling simulations, thus guaranteeing a significant computational time saving with respect to already existing methods. The method is presented first with a preliminary analysis to get some insight into the functional relationship between each of such variables and the overvoltage. Then, the method is presented and validated against numerical calculations performed with a dedicated code, both in terms of punctual evaluations and overvoltage distribution.",

      "abstract": "Lightning is one of the most dangerous natural phenomena, able to produce high impacts and damage on human beings and infrastructures (civil, electric, telecommunications, etc.) even though perception of it as a hazard is low. The aim of this study is to provide a detailed analysis of lightning occurrence throughout the Italian territory to support the work of different operators and researchers (physicists, meteorologists and electric/ITC engineers) improving knowledge about the main properties of lightning. Thus, an in-depth study of the statistics of lightning activity across the Italian territory for the period 2010–2019 is performed in detail using the data collected by the Italian Lightning Detection Network SIRF (Sistema Italiano Rilevamento Fulmini), part of the European network EUCLID (European Cooperation for Lightning Detection). This analysis presents general properties such as Ground Stroke Density (GSD) and the positive to negative strokes ratio by highlighting how seasonal, geographical and orographic factors influence their values. Then, attention is focused on lightning peak current, on flash multiplicity and on the distance between the points of impact of different strokes within a flash. Comparison made with other articles available in the literature reveals good agreement with studies conducted with other LLS data in Mediterranean regions. On the other hand, some differences appear with direct current measurements that can be partly ascribed to Lightning Location System (LLS) detection contamination (confirming other comparative studies of LLS and instrumented tower findings), to differences between tower and ground measures, and to the presence of regional differences.",

In this work, attention is focused on the effects of wideband modeling of electric grounding in the overvoltage calculation along insulator strings due to indirect lightning strikes. This study is done directly in the time-domain with the grounding being represented with an equivalent circuit accounting for its dynamics. Results show that the adoption of commonly adopted simplified grounding models, such as low-frequency resistance, may lead to an underestimation of the overvoltage.

      "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel decentralized and communication-less control strategy for frequency and voltage regulation in Photovoltaic (PV)-Storage islanded Microgrids (MGs). The developed approach aims at achieving a suitable management of the different operational assets of the PV-Storage islanded MGs providing seamless transitions among them and guaranteeing a continuous and effective power supply to the loads. Local inverter controllers are designed exploiting the capabilities of the Model Predictive Control; the resulting control architecture is a composition of local Distributed Generating (DG) unit controller relies only on measurements available on the DG unit site that allows nullifying both frequency and voltage errors providing a suitable repartition of the power request. This way, the proposed approach can combine the advantages of the classic droop and master/slave controllers as it needs neither communication among devices nor a secondary centralized control loop. Moreover, it is able to account for the Storage characteristics imposing a power curtailment of the PV units whenever either the power absorption or the State of Charge limit is reached.",

In this second case, a time-domain analytical expression for the Cooray-Rubinstein formula is presented. The main idea that leads to the derivation of analytical formulas consists of dividing the channel into intervals in which the distance between the field source point and the observation point can be approximated with a linear function of the time, and of the spatial coordinates of both points. In the companion aticle, a detailed comparison is proposed with the classical (numerical) approach highlighting an excellent agreement both at close and far distances, considering all the values of practical interest for the ground conductivity. Moreover, the method guarantees a meaningful improvement in computational performance.",

      "abstract": "Dealing with realistic networks, the solution of lightning electromagnetic field coupling to transmission lines is generally obtained through a Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) algorithm interfaced with an electromagnetic simulator. As well known, the stability of the FDTD scheme is determined by the Courant stability condition. In this contribution, it is shown that a second stability condition that limits the ratio between the space step and the line length appears when spatial extrapolation is used to obtain the values of the currents at the line extremities to be interfaced with a transient electromagnetic simulator. Finally, this work aims at solving the aforementioned problem by using a different approach to obtain the currents at the line extremities.",

      "abstract": "Microgrids (MGs) control is one of the most important and challenging topics in nowadays power system engineering research. The most common and well-known primary control logic is the droop one, since it allows MG sources to share the power request and to participate to the frequency and voltage regulation without a dedicated communication network. Therefore, the stability of a droop-controlled MG working point is a crucial issue that is typically assessed resorting to the small-signal stability theory. However, such approach does not allow to understand whether an equilibrium point can be reached starting from a specified initial condition. In this paper, this problem is faced proposing a stability condition that relies on some simplifying assumptions. The proposed solution does not need any numerical methods or software simulators (often highly CPU demanding). The developed methodology is validated with simulations performed in the PSCAD-EMTDC environment representing the MG components with a high level of detail.",

      "abstract": "Overhead distribution lines can be seriously damaged from lightning events because both direct and indirect events can cause flashovers along the line. The lightning performance of such power lines is usually computed neglecting the effect of corona discharge along the conductors: in particular, the corona discharge determined by the indirect lightning event is taken into account only by few researchers because it can have meaningful impacts only in few cases. However, when we deal with overhead distribution lines with high Critical Flashover value (CFO) and small diameters, the corona discharge caused by indirect events has to be taken into account. This paper shows the effects of corona discharge in the lightning performance computation of overhead distribution lines. The analysis will involve different configurations in terms of line diameter and air conditions, focusing on the negative effect of corona discharge in the number of dangerous events that determine line flashovers.",

Typical users of lightning information are meteorological agencies, aviation or air traffic authorities, land management entities, electric power transmission and distribution operators and other public utilities. Nowadays the lightning strike hazards may be properly managed by using well performing Lightning Location Systems (LLS). All sensors and devices of a network used to detect and locate lightning events can be featured by parameters that numerically describe reliability, precision and ranges of operation. This paper proposes an overview on the main parameters of LLSs: Detection Efficiency, False Alarm Rate and Location Accuracy. The effects of Detection efficiency on cloud-to-ground flashes are discussed. Examples of performance parameters of LLS networks in the Mediterranean area are proposed and, finally, two ground truth reference towers are presented.",

On one hand, numerical stability conditions of the finite-difference time-domain schemes have been deeply investigated in the presence of boundary conditions known analytically; on the other hand, there is not so much literature on the situations in which such conditions are provided in a numerical way through an external electromagnetic simulator. The study reveals that the commonly used linear extrapolation of currents at the line extremities might rise to numerical instabilities.

      "abstract": "One of the most important and studied topics in lightning research is the development of suitable models for the return stroke current and electromagnetic fields. In particular, when dealing with the so-called engineering models, the definition of a function that expresses the attenuation of the current while flowing in the discharge channel (from now on, the attenuation function) is of crucial importance for a reliable computation of the lightning discharge electromagnetic fields and the resulting over voltages induced in a power distribution electric system. The paper contributes to such topic in two ways: first of all, a review of all the well-known engineering models is presented, highlighting the definition of each attenuation function and comparing the models in terms of the resulting overvoltage induced on a typical distribution line. Secondly, an innovative idea based on the possibility of reconstructing the attenuation function starting from the measured electromagnetic fields is presented. The state of the art in this research line is outlined and the issues that are still open are presented. In particular the possibility of adopting the so-called regularization techniques to solve ill posed inverse problems to evaluate the current starting from electromagnetic fields is addressed analysing the available results and highlighting that, to the best of the authors knowledge, these techniques have never been applied with experimental data.",

Their variation affect the results in a non-predictable way and only one variation can cause a high computational cost in the computation procedure. This work presents a method, based on a statistical tool that provides an analytical formula linking the maximum voltage induced on a transmission line with the front duration and the return stroke speed.

      "abstract": "The goal of nuclear fusion is one of the most important challenges in contemporary research and technological development. Its achievability will completely change the energy scenario and reduce the dependence on fossil fuels in the production of electricity. ITER project is focusing the efforts of many countries and researchers in the demonstration of nuclear fusion achievability. Beside the challenges related to the physic of plasma any other challenges in the engineering filed must be faced to realize such an ambitious goal. Among them, the electrical power supply of the ITER superconductive coils will be very demanding. Due to the particularity of the load, the total reactive power requested will exceed the limits imposed by the Transmission System Operator imposing to implement dedicated reactive power compensation strategies. This paper focuses on the two reactive power compensation systems that will be installed at ITER site, focusing on their interaction in terms of voltage stability during fast variations, such as load rejection. As will be shown later in the article, two main strategies for the reactive power sharing are considered. Results concerning both strategies will be analyzed and discussed in terms of system stability and the respect of design voltage limits.",

For this reason, suitable expressions for the helix electromagnetic fields are presented and conditions under which they can be approximated with the ones produced by the classical lightning channel model (i.e., a vertical antenna) are derived. Moreover, the analysis of the deviations between measurements and calculations is used as a tool to propose a channel vertical coordinate dependent function for the speed that guarantees the best fitting. The validation is done considering different line configurations, from a single line to a complex layout with one main feeder and many laterals and in the presence of non-linear elements, such as surge arresters.",

      "abstract": "Chattering alleviation in Sliding Mode control has attracted many researchers in the last decades providing many valuable contributions to this field. One possible way to address this problem is by means of replacing a discontinuous function in the command law definition with an interpolating one, introducing the concept of the boundary layer and quasi-sliding mode control. On the one hand the introduction of this boundary layer helps alleviate the chattering phenomenon but on the other hands deteriorate the performance of the controller itself. In particular, the boundary layer width is the parameter that must be chosen as result of a trade-off and its choice is extremely important for the controller correct operation. Since no straightforward procedures on how to tune this key parameter are available in the technical literature this paper aims at proposing a simple and effective procedure able to satisfactorily address this problem.",

The storage system plays a key role in this scenario, in particular high power permeable storage systems as supercapacitors enable the series architecture to be applied on medium size car obtaining energy saving higher than the ones achievable thanks to standard parallel architectures. However, the low energy density featuring supercapacitors represent the main limitation of this solution if it is conceived as a stand-alone storage system. Indeed, this characteristic can lead to the State of Charge (SOC) saturation, frustrating all the benefits typical of hybrid powertrains. This paper aims therefore at evaluating if a supercapacitor module reasonably sized and employed on series based powertrains (on medium-size car) as the only storage system, can avoid SOC saturation in different road missions.",

The most widely employed protection measures against lightning overvoltages are the use of shield wires and/or surge arresters and increasing the line insulation level. The shield wire beneficial effect is widely demonstrated in many studies, where it is shown that a significant reduction in the induced voltage magnitudes is achieved. This paper presents an analysis on the main parameters that influence the performance of a shield wire to mitigate lightning-induced overvoltages in MV lines. The proposed analysis is based on a statistical method, the Response Surface Method, which permits to obtain the equation of the surface that best approximates a given model.

Achieving such an important goal will completely change the energy scenario and it will reduce the current dependency on fossil fuels with a sustainable alternative. In this framework, ITER project represents the most advanced project for nuclear fusion all over the world. However, challenges related to the physics of the plasma and many others related to various fields of engineering need to be faced in order to accomplish the ITER project development. In particular, one is the need for the definition of suitable discharging units able to de-energise the superconductive coil power supply when necessary. This paper deals with the application of arc models available in the literature to support the definition of a suitable layout for the previously mentioned Fast Discharging Units. This can be achieved firstly by defining a procedure to identify the optimal parameters of the so-called 'Black Box Arc Models' in order to fit the experimental oscillograms provided by circuit breakers producers and secondly by implementing it on a circuital simulator in order to define the compliance of the discharging unit with the coil insulation limits.",

The proposed method is based on the Model Predictive Control (MPC) technique and it is applied to an islanded portion of the Smart Polygeneration Microgrid (SPM) testbed facility of the University of Genoa in Italy. The proposed control system is a decentralized one due to the fact that each inverter is equipped with its own control system that takes into account only local measurements and has the advantage of avoiding any frequency or voltage deviations.

      "abstract": "Lightning overvoltages are one of the most dangerous factors affecting the power quality of a distribution grid. In medium voltage (MV) overhead distribution systems, lightning transients can be caused by either direct or indirect strikes. Indirect strikes are much more frequent than direct strikes and can cause flashovers, especially when the line insulation level is low. The most widely employed protection measures against lightning overvoltages are the use of the shield wires, and/or surge arresters, and increasing the line insulation level. In particular, many studies have shown a significant reduction in the induced voltage magnitudes, thanks to the use of the shield wires in both transmission and distribution systems. This paper deals with the possibility of adopting the shield wires to mitigate lightning induced overvoltages in MV networks, and proposes an analysis on the main parameters that influence their performances. This aim is pursued by means of a probabilistic and statistical analysis based on the response surface method (RSM), which permits to obtain the equation of the surface that best approximates a given model. The application and efficiency of the proposed RSM-based approach have been illustrated by applying it to a realistic situation of a rural distribution line.",

Many papers focused their attention on the evaluation of the effects caused by lightning events on a transmission line, but an overall analysis that takes into account, a real power system is rare to be found. In this paper, the analysis of electromagnetic transients in a connection between a power plant and large power grid is presented with a high detail of the high frequency model for each power system element. In particular, overhead lines, cables, transformers and surge arresters are modelled taking into account all the electromagnetic aspects. The simulations are performed using the well-known code PSCAD-EMTDC, taking into account, different scenarios for the lightning events, and the results show the behaviour of cables and transformers when are subjected to the aforementioned electromagnetic transients with a high level of detail.",

      "abstract": "Microgrids (MGs) may represent a new answer to many old problems in energy and electric world, such as pollution, high reliability, efficiency and so on. The MG rapid increase implies a fast transformation of the electric power systems that are now characterized by new energy sources requiring dedicated control architectures and simulation tools. Unfortunately, the majority of such new sources are connected to the MG by means of power electronic converters that often make it impossible to replicate some of the concepts, tools and control philosophies commonly used in traditional networks. For this reason, there is a strong need of developing models for MG structures that can be reliable but sufficiently simple to be used for the control system design. In this framework, this paper presents a simplified first harmonic model for the Smart Polygeneration Microgrid (SPM) located in the Savona Campus of the University of Genoa that allows the interface with many controllers. The developed simplified model is validated comparing it with a complete simulation performed in the PSCAD-EMTDC environment that allows to represent each component with a high level of detail.",

      "abstract": "Microgrids (MGs) may represent a solution in the near future to many problems in the energy and electric world scenarios; such as pollution, high reliability, efficiency and so on. In particular, MGs' capability to work in an islanded configuration represents one of their most interesting features in terms of the improvement of the reliability of the system, the integration of renewable energy sources and the exploitation of the quick response and flexibility of power electronic devices in a stand-alone system. In order to study and validate innovative solutions and control strategies for islanded operation, there is a need to develop models for MG structures that can be reliable and sufficiently simple to be used for the purpose of the design and validation of innovative control systems. This paper proposes a simplified, first harmonic model for a generic structure of MG characterized by its use of only electronic power converter interfaced generation. The main advantages of the proposed method lie in the model's simplicity and its reduced solving time, thanks to the limited number of necessary parameters to describe the system. Moreover, the developed formulation allows the avoidance of specific (and often licensed) software to simulate the system. The performances of the proposed model have been validated by means of a comparative analysis of the results obtained against a more accurate representation of the system performed in the power system CAD-electromagnetic transient and DC (PSCAD-EMTDC) environment, which allows for the representation of each component with a very high level of detail. Such comparison has been performed using the University of Genoa Savona Campus Smart Polygeneration Microgrid testbed facility, due to the availability of all the necessary numerical values.",

      "abstract": "The aim of the present article is that of proposing a calculation procedure to assess electric quantities at the Point of Interconnection (POI) of large PhotoVoltaic (PV) power plants on the basis of rated data and main design elements of the plant itself. The quantities of inters are active and reactive power available at the POI in order to extrapolate the power plant capability starting from the capabilities of PWM inverters. The procedure also allows evaluating the POI voltage variations, an important element due to the increasing requirements for renewable generation units to participate in voltage regulation. The main interest in such a methodology lays in its simplicity of application, that allows avoiding the usage of dedicated software for load flow calculations, and flexibility, that makes it suitable for the support of the bidding and pre-design phase of large photovoltaic power plants.",
