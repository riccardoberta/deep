      "abstract": "Lightning is a major risk for humans, animals, and electrical systems. Many researches focused on the fully developed events, such as the Return Stroke (RS) current, the emitted electromagnetic fields, and the phenomenon modeling. However, there is poor understanding regarding precursors, such as Preliminary Breakdown Pulses (PBP). PBP are the pulses before the first RS. Studying these pulses provides understanding into the initial event that triggers the process within the cloud. Sufficient measurement data and a reliable model of PBP help to forecast the lightning flash development and help creating effective protection systems, ultimately enhancing the safety and reliability of electrical infrastructure and minimizing the risk of damage from lightinings. The aim of this paper is to conduct an extensive literature review to identify sources of measured data of PBP and the available modeling methods. The first part provides a review of key existing experimental studies, discussing aspects such as measurement equipment, signals, data, identification algorithms, and statistical observations. The second part discusses the methods available for modeling PBP categorized into descriptive and physical models. Descriptive models focus on reconstructing the primary PBP features from measured data, while physical models aim to explore the underlying physical mechanisms of PBPs.",

      "abstract": "The paper presents a new approach for lightning location and peak current estimation based on Deep Learning (DL) algorithms. The basic idea is to use the time domain waveforms of the overvoltages induced by lightning strikes on transmission or distribution lines as features to regress both the location and the channel base current peak of a lightning event. Starting from previous research findings, the performance of the method have been further increased by proposing three different DL models, working either in the frequency or in the time domain. All models are trained with data simulated with the Lightning Power Electromagnetic Simulator for Transient Overvoltages (LIGHT-PESTO). The performances of the methods are first assessed on the same test case as the one presented in a previously published paper to show their increased effectiveness. Then, the best performing model among the three is tested on a more realistic network to show that, even in presence of much more complex systems, its performances are not reduced.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents the evolution of an Energy Management System developed by University of Genoa aimed at minimizing the operation costs of plants and Microgrids (MGs). In the updated version, the Ancillary Service Market (ASM) and Day Ahead Market (DAM) mechanisms are modelled to include the possibility of trading in these markets. Since the Transmission System Operator (TSO) rejection or acceptance in the ASM cannot be forecasted, a statistical approach is proposed. Specifically, the optimization process is divided in two steps: initially the optimal dispatching program is computed, identifying DAM offers and ASM bid and offers that can be proposed. Then, a Monte Carlo method is implemented: by receiving a user defined acceptance rate, the TSO decisions are simulated by extracting sets of awarded proposals from a Probability Density Function (PDF). For each extraction, the second step of the optimization re-dispatches the units based on the bidding program. A PDF of the revenues/costs is the final outcome. Thereafter, the statistical moments of the resulting PDF can be analysed to estimate the profitability of the participation to the markets. A test performed on a real plant over one year demonstrates that longtime horizons may be simulated within reasonable computational time allowing to maintain a high level of details to model devices and markets.",

      "abstract": "Lightning represents a major hazard to humans, buildings, electrical and electronic installations. To date, the majority of investigations have concentrated on the Return Stroke (RS) phase of the lightning flash. Nonetheless, a significant gap persists in the comprehension of RS antecedents, particularly Preliminary Breakdown (PB) pulses, which manifest as a succession of transient signals occurring prior to the initiation of the first RS. Analyzing these initial pulse sequences yields critical insight into the processes that trigger electrical breakdown within thunderclouds. Accordingly, the acquisition of comprehensive measurement datasets and the development of robust models capable of characterizing PB may support the prediction of lightning flash progression and the formulation of more effective protection strategies. Within this framework, this study is intended to provide a survey of existing literature concerning PB data, examining aspects such as measurement instrumentation, recorded signals, data attributes, identification techniques, and statistical findings.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes the implementation of a receding horizon procedure to insert accurate and periodically updated Photovoltaic (PV) power production forecasts into an Energy Management System (EMS). This allows the EMS to compute the optimal scheduling of the dispatchable units of a Microgrid (MG) or polygenerative plant to minimize costs. The PV forecasts are obtained as outcomes of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). To allow reproducibility, the RNN is developed so that it requires input data available on open repositories and accessible with a timeliness consistent with the application. The RNN is used to input PV forecasts to the EMS. Two approaches to feed the EMS are compared: the first one hourly updates the PV forecasts and then launches a run of the EMS to dispatch the units for the next 23 hours. Then, only the control action related to the following hour are considered, and the other ones are discarded. The process is replicated hourly, giving origin to a receding horizon strategy. The second approach receives at midnight the PV forecasts for the next 23 hours and the EMS is run daily to dispatch the units. The effectiveness of the approaches is validated on historical data of a real MG comparing them with the ideal conditions, in which the PV forecast is exact.",

      "abstract": "Purpose – This study aims to investigate the use of machine learning–based algorithms in the field of lightning stroke localization. This work is an important step ahead with respect to the research recently started by the authors, i.e. the possibility of locating a lightning discharge from the voltage induced on overhead transmission lines; more in detail it seeks new insights into the inclusion of both first and subsequent return strokes of negative cloud-to-ground flashes. Design/methodology/approach – This study uses a quantitative approach, using supervised learning techniques for a regression problem (data preprocessing, model selection, training, testing, validation or algorithm optimization). Data are collected from a dedicated lightning-induced overvoltage simulator and analyzed using a specific machine learning–based procedure developed and programmed by the authors. Findings – The results reveal significant improvements in localization accuracy for both first and subsequent strokes, with respect previous works, indicating that the novel approach is promising for future investigation with more complex power system configurations and the use of experimental data. These findings provide evidence that dedicated models for each type of stroke yield better performance, offering significant implications for the integration of machine learning–based lightning location systems into the existing power infrastructure. Originality/value – The proposed method is, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, entirely new and constitute an innovation with respect to the present literature, both of the same authors and of other research groups. In particular, a new preprocessing procedure of the voltage data is proposed, and the performances of different neural networks are evaluated, both for the first and the subsequent stroke. The application to both first and subsequent stroke is an innovation itself because it has not been proposed before.",

      "abstract": "The electromagnetic fields (EMFs) produced by a lightning discharge are usually computed by supposing a vertical channel. However, the tortuous path of channels represents a realistic feature of lightning strikes and can drastically modify the radiated EMFs. Numerical methods for their computation have been developed, mainly based on the superposition law as applied to consecutive rectilinear segments, properly oriented in order to create a tortuous path; however, such methods require a high computational effort, which may be unfeasible for realistic problems. As an alternative approach, this work introduces an equivalent tortuous function, which aims at taking into account the channel tortuosity in the EMF expressions produced by a vertical channel. The proposed function is obtained as the regularized solution of an appropriate inverse problem, and is validated against several tortuous lightning channels.",

      "abstract": "This paper introduces a receding horizon method designed to integrate updated Photovoltaic (PV) power generation forecasts into an effective Energy Management System (EMS). At first, three RNN PV-based forecasting algorithms are compared to find the best architecture based on evaluation metrics, and the most accurate is utilized to estimate the PV power production. Secondly, the best-performing algorithm feeds into the EMS PV power production data. In addition, the feeding process compares two approaches. In the first one, PV forecasts are updated every hour, and the EMS is run to optimize dispatch decisions for the upcoming 23 hours. In the second method, the PV forecast is received at midnight, and the EMS optimizes decisions. The proposed joint approach is verified using an accurate EMS and by comparing the results with the real PV power data benchmark. Hence, the results indicate that the dispatching of units can be accurately predicted using the proposed forecasting techniques, with the hourly update approach yielding the most precise outcomes.",

      "abstract": "The number of HVDC plants is continuously increasing, basically due to practical reasons -i.e. frequent impossibility to develop a terrestrial routing- and to the better exploitation of renewable energy sources. Therefore, the number of sea return electrodes increases, and the risk of damage due to impact with objects such as anchors and fishing nets becomes more probable. One issue that should be analyzed is thus the overall structural resistance of offshore sea electrodes to such kinds of events. Of course, electrode module weight has a significant impact on the time and cost of electrode laying, so it is necessary to find a good compromise between these two conflicting requirements. This paper is aimed at providing an overview of the main arising issues and of the guidelines that can be followed.",

Although the lightning channel is still assumed to be straight, vertical, and at a known distance from the sensors measuring the fields, no model or channel-base measurement of the current is required, so that, unlike previous approaches to this kind of inverse problem, several assumptions on the current propagation along the channel can be dropped. The method is formulated in the frequency domain and is based on a double Fourier series (DFS) representation of the unknown current as a function of two variables, i.e., the vertical coordinate and the frequency. The theoretical investigation results in an inversion algorithm, which is tested against simulated data in order to obtain some examples of current reconstruction.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a tool that allows to perform an ex-ante estimation of the profitability to participate to the electric energy and service markets for a microgrid or a polygeneration power plant. The tool is the evolution of an Energy Management System (EMS) previously developed by the University of Genoa and Renantis Solutions Srl. Constraints are added to the original EMS to model the Ancillary Service Market (ASM) and Day Ahead Market (DAM) mechanisms in the framework of a planning tool that allows to get estimates of the microgrid/plant costs and revenues over a long-time horizon. As the market outcome strongly depends on the Transmission System Operator (TSO) acceptance/rejection of bids and offers, a statistical approach is proposed. The optimization process is split in two steps: the first one optimally dispatches the energy units and proposes DAM offers and ASM bid and offers over a specified time horizon. Then, a Monte Carlo method is launched; at each extraction the TSO acceptance/rejection of each ASM bid and offer is simulated and there is a second step of optimization in which the energy sources are optimally re-dispatched to meet the bidding program and so to avoid imbalance power exchange that would increase the energy cost. The cost/revenue is thus computed at each extraction. The result is the probability density function of the costs/revenues that allows to estimate the profitability of the participation to the electricity markets. One test performed on a real microgrid shows that the computational time needed to complete one iteration related to a time horizon of one month is approximately 20 s. Moreover, the comparison of the outcomes with two independent launches to define the set of bids and offers to be accepted in ASM demonstrates that the statistical analysis allows to avoid misleading conclusions on the costs/revenues. Consequently, the fact that the developed EMS allows to perform a statistical analysis in a reasonable time enables the possibility of comparing multiple scenarios and gives an indication related to the range of cost/revenues in which the microgrid/plant may incur. Finally, the computational efficiency of the proposed approach allows to conclude that the developed EMS is appropriate to perform a long-time horizon (of the order of magnitude of years) analysis and, at the same time, allows to model all the involved components with a high level of details.",

The obtained results show that the proposed approach can be the base for a tool able to regress lighting location with an accuracy comparable to or even better than traditional methods [i.e., lightning location system (LLS)] and provide a peak current estimate more accurate than LLS and more actual and widespread than direct tower measurements (which are limited to a reduced number of recorded events in some specific regions).

      "abstract": "The electric fields radiated by a lightning discharge may represent an important source of damage for electric and electronic equipment. Often, an analysis of such fields in the frequency domain is necessary and their frequency-domain expressions have always been evaluated by considering an infinite time-window and omitting the zero-frequency term coming from the static component of the fields. This work shows that, in order to take into proper account such component, the classical expressions of the electric fields in the frequency domain should be modified by including a distributional term. This aspect may strongly affect numerical algorithms such as the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), since the agreement between Fourier Transform (FT) and FFT is guaranteed only if the FT is a function. Starting from this issue, the present work proposes new frequency-domain expressions of the radial and vertical electric fields by assuming, more realistically, that the time window in which the fields are measured is finite. As a result, the new FT of each time-windowed field is wholly functional again, but it turns out to be modified with respect to its traditional expression.",

      "abstract": "By relying on suitable propagation models, lightning electromagnetic fields can be computed from the knowledge of the channel-base current (CBC) and of the attenuation function. While the CBC is measured by means of instrumented towers, a parametric attenuation function is usually assumed a priori and then compared with the measured fields in order to find optimal values for the CBC parameters. Unlike this approach, the present paper proposes a methodology for the reconstruction of the attenuation function whereby the latter is obtained as the solution of an inverse problem (while maintaining the same kind of input data). Moreover, for the sake of generality, the framework is formulated by considering possibly short time-windows, so that meaningful information can be recovered even when a complete recording of the lightning discharge process is not available. The inversion method is based on an iterative Tikhonov regularization procedure. The proposed approach is then applied to simulated data of electric and magnetic fields, as well as of CBC current, blurred by numerical noise in the time domain. The resulting algorithm turns out to provide a good accuracy in reconstructing a fictitious attenuation function. Finally, a short sensitivity analysis on the electromagnetic field noise and on the radial distance error is presented.",

      "abstract": "High Voltage Direct Current power links are usually designed to adopt, on a continuous basis or during emergency operations, two grounding plants using the soil or seawater as a link–current return path. Such DCs flowing into the ground can cause problems, of which one of the most important is the increased risk of the corrosion of metallic structures in the area. Normally, the simplest mitigation technique is to keep an adequate distance between the main grounding plants and any metallic structure that can be corroded. Normally, such distances are not less than 5 km. However, there are situations where this approach cannot be applied, for example due to geographical constraints. In this paper, we describe and analyze the behavior of a mitigation technique that can be adopted when the HV pole cable is laid closer than the recommended distance to the main ground electrode. This paper is focused on the minimization of deleterious effects on the cable’s metallic sheath and its earthing points, distributed along it by means of sheath segmentation. The suggested approach appears well-suited to substantially diminishing the current flowing through the sheath of an HVDC power cable. In the segmented scenario, the sheath’s power dissipation is less than one-hundredth of that in the typical continuous configuration.",

      "abstract": "In a recent paper, a procedure to reconstruct the attenuation function of a return-stroke current from the simultaneous measurements of the channel-base current and the radiated electromagnetic fields was presented. One of the assumptions of the whole framework was that the sensors can record the overall time-evolution of the lightning return-stroke, namely from its start to its end. However, this condition is too restrictive for most of the real data collected in the past decades, since they were generally acquired for other goals than the reconstruction of the attenuation function. Accordingly, in the present paper we perform a theoretical investigation aimed at removing such restriction. As a result, we first derive a new set of integral equations that relate the channel-base current to the radiated fields during a generic time-window, then we obtain the corresponding equations in the frequency domain via Fourier Transform, which represent the analytical formulation of an inverse problem to be numerically solved through appropriate regularization techniques.",

      "abstract": "HVDC electrodes are usually implemented in HVDC links to avoid the installation of a metallic return. Submarine cables, especially those dealing with lengths of thousands of kilometers, are expensive, and high costs of laying are normally expected. Due to the high number of reversible HVDC links, the marine electrodes must be able to withstand both anodic and cathodic operations, which leads to careful considerations in terms of the material to be used. This paper shows the state of the art of the currently installed reversible sea return electrodes, focusing on the type of installation (sea, shore or pond electrodes) and on the material used, from the first plant installed in 1954 up to the more recent ones established during the XXI century. All reported data derive from publicly available sources. Moreover, since nowadays environmental issues are among the most important topics, for each material and for each type of installation, a guideline on the possible interferences caused by marine electrodes with the surrounding environment is proposed.",

      "abstract": "Lightning represents one of the most critical issues for electrical infrastructure. In dealing with overhead distribution line systems, indirect lightning strikes can lead to induced voltages overcoming the critical flashover value of the line, thus damaging the insulators. The computation of lightning-induced voltages requires the modeling of the lightning current, the evaluation of the lightning electromagnetic fields and the solution of the field-to-line coupling equations. The numerical calculation of the lightning electromagnetic fields is time-consuming and is strongly dependent on the lightning channel modeling and soil properties. This article presents a review of the most widely adopted methods to calculate the lightning electromagnetic fields, starting from the classical formulation, which requires numerical integration, and highlighting the most effective approaches that have been developed to reduce computational effort. This is done first for the case of a perfectly conducting ground, then the available formulations to account for the ground finite conductivity are presented together with their possible implementations in both the frequency and time domains.",

      "abstract": "To face the complexity introduced by the ever-increasing participation of new energy sources, storage systems and controllable loads to electricity markets, Distributed Energy Systems must optimize the power exchange. Usually, Energy Management System (EMS) are used to manage Micro-Grids (MGs) operations, but computational timings may become prohibitive, due to high number of constraints and links between parameters and technical constraints. This paper describes the evolution of the Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) MATLAB Based Energy Management System (MB-EMS) developed at the University of Genoa, aimed at optimizing the operating costs of a MG or plant, considering technical constraints and limitations of electrical and thermal production units, energy storage systems, non-programmable loads and flexible loads. Costs related to maintenance interventions and CO<inf>2</inf>emissions costs are also included, as well as incentives related to the High-Efficiency Cogeneration systems. Specific test cases for a real MG are solved in a short computational time over a time horizon of one year. Calculations are rapidly performed, also when dealing with 15 minutes resolution problems. In this sense, the developed tool can be used both as a real time scheduler, as instance for participation in the energy market sector, and in long term planning problems.",

      "abstract": "The behavior of the return-stroke current along the lightning channel is extremely important for the evaluation of the electromagnetic fields radiated at various distances, since such fields may cause disturbances or faults on electric and electronic equipment. It is commonly known that lightning current attenuates while propagating along the channel and several models have been adopted in an attempt to reproduce the characteristics of the electromagnetic fields at different distances. This work proposes a method that can reconstruct the attenuation of the current along the channel, starting from the knowledge of the channel-base current and of the vertical electric field measured by a sensor located five km away from the discharge location. The method relies upon the Tikhonov regularization technique applied to an ill-posed problem in the frequency domain and is mainly based on the hypothesis of long-time measurement windows.",

      "abstract": "Lightning strikes attachment to Wind Turbines (WTs) is not uncommon. The current discharge along the WT components can cause variations in the electromagnetic field radiation, affecting the surrounding power and electronic systems. In this contribution, a WT transient response to direct lightning strikes is studied with a full-Maxwell approach, involving a complete model for the WT. Simulations are carried out considering both first and subsequent return strokes to one of the rotor blades. Significant reflections are found in the lightning current waveforms through the WT, and this gives rise to amplifications in the radiated electromagnetic fields with respect to ground discharges.",

      "abstract": "The electromagnetic lightning field is usually computed by considering a model consisting in a vertical and rectilinear channel, as well as a Transmission-Line (TL) type propagation characterized by an attenuation function, which expresses how the current decreases while it travels upward along the lightning channel. When dealing with realistic channels, affected by tortuosity, the current attenuation is usually neglected and the field computation is cumbersome, since the discretization of the channel in a large number of linear segments has to be performed. This contribution presents an equivalent attenuation function to be used in the computation of vertical channels in order to reproduce the results of a tortuous one. The attenuation function is computed by solving an inverse problem through the Tikhonov regularization technique, and it is found to be reliable for distances larger than 5 km from the lightning channel.",

      "abstract": "Lightning events can cause several damages to electronic and electric infrastructure. One of the most important variables is the channel-base current (CBC) waveform, usually measured by means of proper instruments installed on tall towers where the striking probability is higher. However, the presence of the tower itself and the low number of registered events represent a critical issue in the possibility of acquiring a large amount of data. On the other hand, Lightning Location Systems are able to provide a high number of data, but limited to the peak value of the current. This work proposes an algorithm that can reconstruct the CBC from remote measurements of the vertical electric field and/or the azimuthal magnetic field taken during a finite time-window [0, T].",

      "abstract": "Lightning may be the cause of outages and faults on electrical infrastructures. In overhead distribution lines, voltages overcoming the critical flashover value of the line may be induced by indirect lightning strikes, and this fact may cause serious damages to insulators. Consequently, the assessment of induced voltages is an important aspect in the design phase of transmission and distribution lines. To this goal, the lightning current shall be modeled, the electromagnetic fields should be evaluated and the field-to-line coupling equations implemented. In case time dependent functions are considered, the lightning electromagnetic fields may also be numerically approximated, but, usually, such approximation requires significant computational efforts and strongly depend on the way in which the lightning channel is modeled and on the soil properties. The present paper proposes an overview of the most utilized methodologies aiming at numerically or analytically approximating the lightning electromagnetic fields. Under the hypothesis of perfectly conducting ground, the classical formulation, requiring numerical integration is firstly presented. Then, the most effective approaches aiming at reducing computational timings are discussed. Finally, the models available to represent the lightning tortuosity are presented.",

This contribution presents a novel semi-analytical approach for the calculation of lightning electromagnetic fields considering channel tortuosity with an arbitrary current source.

      "abstract": "The ever-increasing participation of new energy sources, storage systems and controllable loads to electricity markets has introduced more complexity in the operation of power plants, microgrids (MGs) and networks. To face these issues, it is often necessary to design Distributed Energy Systems to optimize the power exchange. Usually, MG operation is managed by an Energy Management System (EMS) dealing with large amounts of parameters to be taken into account and that may drive to problems difficult to be faced and requiring long computational timings. In this direction, this paper describes the Mixed Integer Linear Programming MATLAB Based Energy Management System (MB-EMS) developed at the University of Genoa, aimed at optimizing the operating costs of a generic polygeneration system, considering different electrical and thermal production units, energy storage systems, non-programmable loads and flexible loads. Many important technical details are accounted: the duration and costs related to maintenance interventions and CO<inf>2</inf> emissions costs are considered for all production units as well as constraints and incentives related to the High-Efficiency Cogeneration systems. Constraints related to the minimum and maximum State-Of-Charge of energy storage systems, plus their deterioration, with the consequent optimization of their utilization, are also modelled. Specific test cases for all functionalities are presented. Moreover, a test related to a real MG performed over a time horizon of one year with a time step of 1 h is performed and solved in a short computational time. The linearization of constraints reduces the computational effort, avoiding the need of clustering or averaging parameters for similar production units. Consequently, calculations are rapidly performed, also when dealing with long term planning problems (a realistic test case with time horizon of one year and time step of 15 min can be simulated in some seconds). In this sense, the developed tool can be used both in real time operation and in long term planning problems.",

      "abstract": "A correct representation of the lightning current is crucial when the electromagnetic field radiated to a point of interest has to be computed. Based on the engineering models of Transmission Line type, such representation involves the knowledge of the return-stroke speed, the channel-base current, the channel height and the attenuation function. Whereas the first three quantities can be measured in different ways, no measurement technique can directly provide reliable information on the attenuation function. In the past decades, researchers have applied various strategies to address this problem. These strategies are all based on a common feature, i.e., the unknown function is postulated a priori and then validated through the comparison of the computed electromagnetic fields at one or more observation points with the corresponding measured waveforms. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach for the identification of the attenuation function: starting from appropriate measurements of the return-stroke speed, the channel-base current, the channel height and the radiated electromagnetic field, we first formulate an algebraic inverse and ill-posed problem, obtained from the discretization of integral equations relating the source to the radiated field in the frequency domain, and then we solve it by means of a Tikhonov regularization technique. The proposed framework is preceded by a detailed theoretical analysis, with special emphasis on the description and filtering of measurement noise and on the minimum duration of the measurement time-windows ensuring reliable results.",

      "abstract": "This article presents the Lightning Performance (LP) assessment of a realistic portion of the Italian distribution network with the use of probability distributions for lightning parameters inferred from local data recorded by a Lightning Location System (LLS). The procedure considers downward negative first, negative subsequent, and positive return strokes, taking into account the number of strokes per flash (flash multiplicity) and the distance among return stroke impact points within the same flash (stroke terminations distance). The analysis of the effect produced using LLS data on the estimated number of flashovers per year on the test line is achieved by replacing one by one the standard distributions and parameters typically adopted in the literature, with those inferred from the LLS, when they can be considered reliable. Results show that adopting LLS-inferred parameters and distributions produces significant (positive or negative) variations in the estimated number of flashovers with respect to values computed with the standard approach.",

      "abstract": "Lightning electromagnetic (EM) fields are typically computed by assuming the current propagation within a straight vertical channel of negligible cross section. However, it is well known that the lightning path is tortuous and this can significantly affect the radiated fields and the lightning-induced voltages on power lines. Lupò et al. (2000) proposed an analytical method evaluating the EM fields radiated by a tortuous channel assuming a step current source; to consider an arbitrary (realistic) current source, a slow-converging convolution integral was applied. The aim of this article is to reduce the computation time of such procedure by extending to the tortuous channel case the approach proposed by Brignone et al. (2021) for the evaluation of the lightning EM fields with arbitrary current source, originally developed for a straight vertical channel. The performances of the present method are evaluated by means of comparison with the solution proposed by Lupò et al. (2000), showing an excellent agreement with a significant reduction of the CPU effort. This in principle will allow the computation of lightning-induced overvoltages at both individual and statistical level without a prohibitive computational effort.",

      "abstract": "Wind turbines (WTs) can beseriously damaged by lightning strikes and they can be struck by a significant number of flashes. This should be taken into account when the WT lightning protection system is designed. Moreover, WTs represent a path for the lightning current that can modify the well-known effects of the lightning discharge in terms of radiated electromagnetic fields, which are a source of damage and interference for nearby structures and systems. In this paper, a WT struck by a lightning discharge is analyzed with a full-wave modelling approach, taking into account the details of the WT and its interactions with the lightning channel. The effects of first and subsequent return strokes are analyzed as well as that of the rotation angle of the struck blade. Results show that the lightning current along the WT is mainly affected by the ground reflection and by the reflection between the struck blade and the channel. The computed electromagnetic fields show that, for subsequent return strokes, the presence of a WT almost doubles their magnitude with respect to a lightning striking the ground. Such enhancement is emphasized when the inclined struck blade is considered.",

      "abstract": "Lightning strikes can seriously affect the reliability and availability of electrical infrastructures. The computation of lightning-electromagnetic fields represents one of the most crucial steps in the evaluation of the induced effects; thus, having at disposal accurate and efficient dedicated tools is essential. This paper proposes a new approach for the lightning-electromagnetic fields computation above a perfectly conducting ground. The proposed approach does not involve any assumption either on the channel-base current waveshape or on the attenuation function of the current along the channel. Integrals are expanded in series of exponential functions (Prony series) which makes them analytically solvable. The proposed approach results in a speed up of the computational time by a factor of 10 to some hundreds with respect to classical numerical approaches. The proposed method is validated against the classical formulas obtained through numerical integration for different channel-base current waveforms, attenuation functions and observation points.",

      "abstract": "The Fourier transform (FT) of the electric field (EF) radiated by a lightning return stroke is shown to include a distributional term at zero frequency, which prevents numerical algorithms, such as fast FT, from working properly. Inspired by the finite duration of any field measurement in real applications, we introduce a time-windowing strategy, whereby the integration time-interval of the FT becomes bounded. As a result, the distributional term is removed from the FT, whereas the functional part of the FT is modified throughout the whole range of frequencies, in such a way that a good performance of the numerical algorithms can be restored. The dependence of the modified spectra of the EFs on the length of the time window is also investigated and three numerical experiments with different channel-base currents are performed to validate the whole resulting framework.",

      "abstract": "This paper develops a Dynamic Market Mechanism (μDMM) to optimally allocate electric and thermal power in a combined heat and power microgrid. The market mechanism is formulated as a receding horizon constrained optimization problem, from which an optimal automated transactive procedure is developed. Its operation is distributed in nature and incorporates the most up-to-date electric and thermal load estimates and renewable generation. The results of the market clearing of the proposed microgrid μDMM are the spot prices and schedules for electric and thermal power in addition to non-binding estimates of future prices and set-points. The performance of the μDMM is illustrated using simulation studies of a Combine Heat and Power (CHP) microgrid model based on the Smart Polygeneration Microgrid (SPM) located on the University of Genova Savona Campus. The results show that the μDMM has the ability to adapt to new information via updated forecasts and improve the performance of microgrid operation compared to a centralized method. This in turn makes the μDMM attractive for use in μEMS (microgrid Energy Management Systems) by allowing new energy resources to be added in a plug and play fashion.",

      "abstract": "The Smart Polygeneration Microgrid (SPM) at the Savona Campus of the University of Genoa consists of several renewable and traditional electrical and thermal generating units integrated with electric batteries; buildings and facilities are connected by an electrical grid and a district heating network. Thermal and electrical power flows are managed by a proper Energy Management System (EMS) which includes models for all the SPM components ensuring operational costs minimization in compliance with networks constraints. The present study focuses on the integration of a thermal energy storage (TS) system in the SPM: to this aim, a new thermal storage model based on a stepped two-zone approach has been built inside the dynamic EMS solver. The TS is conceived for recovering additional heat from two 65kW<inf>el</inf> cogenerative gas turbines (CGT), thus minimizing the operation time of the backup gas heaters (GH): the analysis is aimed at inferring the best TS size in terms of different key parameters, expressed through properly defined economic and energy criteria, including overall energy consumption, reduced greenhouse emissions, minimum payback period. The model is applied to energy demand data (heat and electricity) as measured at 15 min time steps along 2 years. The present dynamic analysis shows that an optimized size TS based on sensible heat can increase the CGT operation hours up to 34% yearly and reduce the equivalent CO<inf>2</inf> emissions by 4%.",

      "abstract": "This contribution discusses the combined impact of the uncertainties related to the forecasts of the power production from Renewable Energy Sources, the Electrical Load and the Thermal Load on the operation costs of a microgrid. To quantify the possible variation of the cost determined by an Energy Management System, a stochastic approach has been adopted. The perturbation of the forecasted data is obtained adding to the abovementioned variables random numbers according to a suitable Probability Density Function. To this purpose, both Uniform and Normal distribution have been used. The analysis is developed referring to a test case facility: the Smart Polygeneration Microgrid of the University of Genoa. Among the possible cases, four combinations have been presented, to perturb the data with a 5%, 20% and 50% variation. The analyzed cases show that an increase in the error on the forecasts of the Electrical Load, the Thermal Load and the production from Renewable Energy Sources, causes a final cost increase. As expected, lower perturbations produce lower deviations with respect to the cost calculated by the Energy Management System. For all the presented cases, no significant differences in the minimum and maximum deviation from the costs calculated by the Energy Management System when variables are perturbated using a Normal or Uniform Probability Density Function have been found. The application of perturbations on a real test facility shows the reliability of the calculations performed by the Energy Management System, also considering the fact that the Electric Load, the Thermal Load and the power production from Renewable Energy Sources are parameters affected by uncertainty.",

      "abstract": "Lightning-related phenomena are one of the most dangerous factors affecting the overhead distribution systems. Said that, protective measures to reduce lightning damages are an important issue to guarantee distribution line reliability. The most widely employed protective measures against lightning are: shield wires, surge arresters, and increasing the line insulation level, usually by increasing the length of insulator strings. Among the aforementioned techniques, one that deserves a special attention is installing lightning arresters, since it can be very effective and commonly used in reducing lightning overvoltage. In this way, this paper presents a comparative study of the induced overvoltage calculation along insulator strings due to indirect lightning strikes in the distribution lines with and without the installation of surger arresters and comparing results considering a simple and rigorous modeling of the pole-footing grounding system. Furthermore, a simplified representation of the model of the pole-footing grounding system, in which the surge arresters will be installed, commonly adopted may lead to an underestimation of the overvoltage. The results point that the surge arresters are able to isolate the propagation of the induced voltages in adjacent poles by positioning them at poles in alternate pattern. The maximum voltage difference found when considering the rigorous model instead of the simplified model of the pole-footing grounding system, for the cases studied, was around 6.42%.",

      "abstract": "Dealing with lightning performance computation, researchers usually consider only negative downward first return strokes and the relevant channel-base peak current distribution. The aim of this article is to account for the lightning flash mechanism, which means to include also downward negative subsequent strokes and downward positive strokes, taking into account available distributions of the number of strokes per flash (i.e., the flash multiplicity) and of the distance among the impact points of the strokes within the same flash (i.e., the channel terminations distance). In this regard, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the present study is the first one taking into account the multiple ground channel terminations in the lightning performance assessment. The obtained results show that both the negative subsequent strokes and multiple channel termination determine a significant increase in the estimated number of flashovers per year, and they need to be considered in the lightning performance assessment. On the other hand, considering positive downward strokes, a less remarkable increase in the estimated number of flashovers per year is observed.",

The coefficients of such formulas are obtained thanks to a limited number of lightning field-to-line coupling simulations, thus guaranteeing a significant computational time saving with respect to already existing methods. The method is presented first with a preliminary analysis to get some insight into the functional relationship between each of such variables and the overvoltage. Then, the method is presented and validated against numerical calculations performed with a dedicated code, both in terms of punctual evaluations and overvoltage distribution.",

      "abstract": "Lightning is one of the most dangerous natural phenomena, able to produce high impacts and damage on human beings and infrastructures (civil, electric, telecommunications, etc.) even though perception of it as a hazard is low. The aim of this study is to provide a detailed analysis of lightning occurrence throughout the Italian territory to support the work of different operators and researchers (physicists, meteorologists and electric/ITC engineers) improving knowledge about the main properties of lightning. Thus, an in-depth study of the statistics of lightning activity across the Italian territory for the period 2010–2019 is performed in detail using the data collected by the Italian Lightning Detection Network SIRF (Sistema Italiano Rilevamento Fulmini), part of the European network EUCLID (European Cooperation for Lightning Detection). This analysis presents general properties such as Ground Stroke Density (GSD) and the positive to negative strokes ratio by highlighting how seasonal, geographical and orographic factors influence their values. Then, attention is focused on lightning peak current, on flash multiplicity and on the distance between the points of impact of different strokes within a flash. Comparison made with other articles available in the literature reveals good agreement with studies conducted with other LLS data in Mediterranean regions. On the other hand, some differences appear with direct current measurements that can be partly ascribed to Lightning Location System (LLS) detection contamination (confirming other comparative studies of LLS and instrumented tower findings), to differences between tower and ground measures, and to the presence of regional differences.",

In this second case, a time-domain analytical expression for the Cooray-Rubinstein formula is presented. The main idea that leads to the derivation of analytical formulas consists of dividing the channel into intervals in which the distance between the field source point and the observation point can be approximated with a linear function of the time, and of the spatial coordinates of both points. In the companion aticle, a detailed comparison is proposed with the classical (numerical) approach highlighting an excellent agreement both at close and far distances, considering all the values of practical interest for the ground conductivity. Moreover, the method guarantees a meaningful improvement in computational performance.",

The validation is presented with different configurations in terms of channel-base current, ground conductivity, and distance to the lightning channel, comparing the obtained results with the numerical integration of the classical formulas. The comparative analysis shows a perfect agreement between the proposed analytical approach and reference numerical simulations. Moreover, the computational effort of the proposed method is discussed, focusing the attention on the choice of the points in which the channel has to be divided in order to maximize the CPU time savings without losing accuracy.",

As well known, the stability of the FDTD scheme is determined by the Courant stability condition. In this contribution, it is shown that a second stability condition that limits the ratio between the space step and the line length appears when spatial extrapolation is used to obtain the values of the currents at the line extremities to be interfaced with a transient electromagnetic simulator. Finally, this work aims at solving the aforementioned problem by using a different approach to obtain the currents at the line extremities.",

      "abstract": "Microgrids (MGs) control is one of the most important and challenging topics in nowadays power system engineering research. The most common and well-known primary control logic is the droop one, since it allows MG sources to share the power request and to participate to the frequency and voltage regulation without a dedicated communication network. Therefore, the stability of a droop-controlled MG working point is a crucial issue that is typically assessed resorting to the small-signal stability theory. However, such approach does not allow to understand whether an equilibrium point can be reached starting from a specified initial condition. In this paper, this problem is faced proposing a stability condition that relies on some simplifying assumptions. The proposed solution does not need any numerical methods or software simulators (often highly CPU demanding). The developed methodology is validated with simulations performed in the PSCAD-EMTDC environment representing the MG components with a high level of detail.",

      "abstract": "Overhead distribution lines can be seriously damaged from lightning events because both direct and indirect events can cause flashovers along the line. The lightning performance of such power lines is usually computed neglecting the effect of corona discharge along the conductors: in particular, the corona discharge determined by the indirect lightning event is taken into account only by few researchers because it can have meaningful impacts only in few cases. However, when we deal with overhead distribution lines with high Critical Flashover value (CFO) and small diameters, the corona discharge caused by indirect events has to be taken into account. This paper shows the effects of corona discharge in the lightning performance computation of overhead distribution lines. The analysis will involve different configurations in terms of line diameter and air conditions, focusing on the negative effect of corona discharge in the number of dangerous events that determine line flashovers.",

An improved understanding of the phenomenon is important for warning and safety applications, in order to perform reliable risk assessment to respond to impacts. The introduction of Lightning Location Systems (LLS) helped mitigating threats since 1920. This contribution is focused on LLSs for intra-cloud and cloud-to-ground discharges, aiming at presenting an overview on the working principles of the most used techniques to locate lightning. The companion paper will describe in detail the performances of the main LLS and present examples of some existing LLS networks, with particular attention to the ones that operate in the Mediterranean areas.",

      "abstract": "One of the main issues that has to be faced when evaluating lightning-induced overvoltages on a realistic network configuration is to implement the algorithm that solves the field-to-line coupling problem into an electromagnetic simulator that is able to represent with a high level of detail all the power system components. On one hand, numerical stability conditions of the finite-difference time-domain schemes have been deeply investigated in the presence of boundary conditions known analytically; on the other hand, there is not so much literature on the situations in which such conditions are provided in a numerical way through an external electromagnetic simulator. The study reveals that the commonly used linear extrapolation of currents at the line extremities might rise to numerical instabilities. An efficient solution using the method of characteristics is presented and validated.",

      "abstract": "One of the most important and studied topics in lightning research is the development of suitable models for the return stroke current and electromagnetic fields. In particular, when dealing with the so-called engineering models, the definition of a function that expresses the attenuation of the current while flowing in the discharge channel (from now on, the attenuation function) is of crucial importance for a reliable computation of the lightning discharge electromagnetic fields and the resulting over voltages induced in a power distribution electric system. The paper contributes to such topic in two ways: first of all, a review of all the well-known engineering models is presented, highlighting the definition of each attenuation function and comparing the models in terms of the resulting overvoltage induced on a typical distribution line. Secondly, an innovative idea based on the possibility of reconstructing the attenuation function starting from the measured electromagnetic fields is presented. The state of the art in this research line is outlined and the issues that are still open are presented. In particular the possibility of adopting the so-called regularization techniques to solve ill posed inverse problems to evaluate the current starting from electromagnetic fields is addressed analysing the available results and highlighting that, to the best of the authors knowledge, these techniques have never been applied with experimental data.",

      "abstract": "Coastal areas represent one of the most important economic driving forces for entire countries. In the last decades, along coastal areas it has been observed a marked increase in risk of bathing due to the advent of mass tourism, particularly during the summer season. Local and global reports on bathing-related incidents highlight the importance of beach safety in coastal management. This paper describes a cost-effective and semi-quantitative approach for beach safety and sea bathing risk estimation. The methodology was applied to a coastal stretch located in eastern Liguria (north western Italy, Ligurian Sea), which is characterized by high tourism vocation and can be considered indicative of some main features of Mediterranean shores. The peculiar geomorphological and hydrodynamic hazard descriptors and the beach accessibility (i.e., the exposure of bathers to hazard) of the study area have been evaluated by means of open source archive information, field surveys and expert judgement. Subsequently, probability theory was used to estimate the Hazard Index and the Risk of Bathing Index. The resulting zoning maps show that beach safety and risk of bathing do not have a uniform distribution along this coastal sector since both hazard and risk conditioning variables can frequently change from one site to another. Considering the large and rapidly expanding tourism activities in coastal environments, the obtained zoning maps reveal that the proposed method can be a flexible and simple tool for stakeholders in charge of coastal management. The proposed approach may be also adapted to other coastal-type environments by means of an accurate identification of hazard and beach accessibility descriptors that better characterise the stretch of coast under consideration.",

For this reason, suitable expressions for the helix electromagnetic fields are presented and conditions under which they can be approximated with the ones produced by the classical lightning channel model (i.e., a vertical antenna) are derived. Moreover, the analysis of the deviations between measurements and calculations is used as a tool to propose a channel vertical coordinate dependent function for the speed that guarantees the best fitting. The validation is done considering different line configurations, from a single line to a complex layout with one main feeder and many laterals and in the presence of non-linear elements, such as surge arresters.",

      "abstract": "Model-based control techniques have been gaining more and more interest these days. These complex control systems are mostly based on theories, such as feedback linearization, model predictive control, adaptive and robust control. In this paper the latter approach is investigated, in particular, sliding mode (SM) control is analyzed. While several works on the description and application of SM control on single-input single-output systems can easily be found, its application on multi-input multi-output systems is not examined in depth at the same level. Hence, this work aims at formalizing some theoretical complements about the necessary conditions for the feasibility of the SM control for multi-input-multi-output systems. Furthermore, in order to obtain the desired performance from the control system, a method for parameter tuning is proposed in the particular case in which the relative degree of the controlled channels is equal to one. Finally, a simple control problem example is shown with the aim of stressing the benefits derived from the application of the theoretical complements described here.",

      "abstract": "Lightning overvoltages are one of the most dangerous factors affecting the power quality of a distribution grid. In medium voltage (MV) overhead distribution systems, lightning transients can be caused by either direct or indirect strikes. Indirect strikes are much more frequent than direct strikes and can cause flashovers, especially when the line insulation level is low. The most widely employed protection measures against lightning overvoltages are the use of the shield wires, and/or surge arresters, and increasing the line insulation level. In particular, many studies have shown a significant reduction in the induced voltage magnitudes, thanks to the use of the shield wires in both transmission and distribution systems. This paper deals with the possibility of adopting the shield wires to mitigate lightning induced overvoltages in MV networks, and proposes an analysis on the main parameters that influence their performances. This aim is pursued by means of a probabilistic and statistical analysis based on the response surface method (RSM), which permits to obtain the equation of the surface that best approximates a given model. The application and efficiency of the proposed RSM-based approach have been illustrated by applying it to a realistic situation of a rural distribution line.",

      "abstract": "The present paper is addressed to a further development of the Energy Management System (EMS) which is implemented and running at the Smart Polygeneration Microgrid (SPM) at the Savona Campus of the University of Genova. The SPM thermal network is constituted by heat generation units (cogenerative gas turbines and gas boilers, overall thermal power about 1MWth) and a network of pipelines providing the heat to a series of buildings during the daily working hours. Being the electric power demand significantly present also at night, a heat storage system would be advisable for full cogeneration all day long. For this reason the existing EMS model and predictive control has been modified for taking into account the presence of a thermal storage system of suitable volume. The new operation scheme at simulation level also includes a biomass burner, to be switched on in priority with respect to the existing gas burners. The approach for modelling the heat storage, in terms mainly of storage energy content, allows the economic feasibility of the investment to be assessed when subhourly simulations of real operating conditions are performed with respect to recent historical time series of electric and heat load demand at the Savona Campus.",

      "abstract": "Metastasized castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), is the most advanced form of prostate neoplasia, where massive spread to the skeletal tissue is frequent. Patients with this condition are benefiting from an increasing number of treatment options. However, assessing tumor response in patients with multiple localizations might be challenging. For this reason, many computational approaches have been developed in the last decades to quantify the skeletal tumor burden and treatment response. In this review, we analyzed the progressive development and diffusion of such approaches. A computerized literature search of the PubMed/Medline was conducted, including articles between January 2008 and March 2018. The search was expanded by manually reviewing the reference list of the chosen articles. Thirty-five studies were identified. The number of eligible studies greatly increased over time. Studies could be categorized in the following categories: automated analysis of 2D scans, SUV-based thresholding, hybrid CT-and SUV-based thresholding, and MRI-based thresholding. All methods are discussed in detail. Automated analysis of bone tumor burden in mCRPC is a growing field of research; when choosing the appropriate method of analysis, it is important to consider the possible advantages as well as the limitations thoroughly.",

      "abstract": "The paper aims at presenting a methodology to choose the proper sizing of an integrated Photovoltaic unit and a storage architecture starting from the knowledge of the load and solar irradiance time profiles. To do this, first a simple logic to manage the charging/discharging of the storage is proposed, then the function representing the overall cost during the whole life of the system is derived. The computation of the cost function for different photovoltaic and storage sizes allows finding the best sizing of the system. Finally, a thorough economic analysis is conducted to provide criteria to check whether the investment is economically advantageous. This is done considering the impact of the economic variables which are more influential on the investment key assessment parameters. The proposed methodology has been validated in different realistic test cases against the results provided by an energy management system, showing an excellent agreement between the approaches. Moreover, the economic analysis has been applied to four realistic situations in order to tailor the microgrid components ratings on the specific test case.",

Another possibility consists of measuring the electromagnetic field and reconstructing the channel current by solving an inverse problem, which can be done resorting to some dedicated mathematical tools: the so-called regularization techniques.",

The market is formulated as a receding horizon constrained optimization problem, from which an optimal automated transactive procedure is developed. The market operation is distributed in nature and incorporates the most up-to-date electric and thermal load estimates and renewable generation. These properties make our microgrid DMM, µDMM, attractive for microgrid energy management systems, as new smart buildings, battery storage systems, and renewable energy resources can be added in a plug-and-play fashion without reformulating the optimization problem and without adding computational complexity to the EMS. The result of the market clearing is the spot prices and set-points for electric and thermal power in addition to non-binding estimates of future prices and set-points. The the market mechanism is simulated on a CHP Microgrid model based on the Smart Polygeneration Microgrid (SPM) located on the University of Genoa's Savona campus.",

      "abstract": "The present paper proposes an Energy Management System (EMS) to be used in grid connected microgrids. To do this, first a suitable model (for optimization purposes) of all the components that typically appear in a microgrid is presented, then, four possible electric network models are detailed and finally the overall architecture of the optimization problem of the EMS is set up. Moreover, as the optimization of the energy production/consumption of a microgrid relies on the thermal and electric load and on the renewables forecasting, an online empirical correction of forecasted data is proposed, highlighting its positive impact on the overall operational cost of the microgrid. Another aspect which is accounted regards the possibility of allowing the EMS to act as a power plant controller in compliance with the Distribution System Operator (DSO) requirements in terms of reactive power management and voltage control (as requested by the majority of grid codes and national regulations). So, the proposed algorithm structure splits the optimization problem into two sub problems: the first one basically dictates the active power production of the dispatchable units minimizing an economic objective function, while the second accounts for the satisfaction of the DSO requirements. The experimental validation of the proposed EMS is performed on the University of Genoa Smart Polygeneration Microgrid (SPM), where the proposed EMS is currently running. The considered test cases highlight the effectiveness of the proposed EMS in economically operating the microgrid (compared to simpler EMS previously installed in the SPM) and in satisfying the reactive power or voltage regulation requirements provided by the Italian technical requirements.",

As the majority of renewable sources are connected to the MG by means of power electronic converters, it is often impossible to replicate some of the concepts, tools and control philosophies commonly used in traditional networks. One of the more frequent control methods in literature is the droop philosophy, whose stability issues have been deeply investigated. In order to evaluate the stability of a droop controlled MG, the present paper presents a new method, whose main advantage is the reduction of the computational effort that reflects in benefits for PLC and control hardware implementation.

As far as the first aspect is concerned, the procedure is cyclically repeated at each time-step after that loads and renewable productions have been adjusted by means of real-time measurements. The economic aspects are performed by solving an optimization problem that minimizes the overall production cost and, therefore, it fixes the active power set point for all the programmable units. The Distribution System Operator (DSO) requirements in terms of active/reactive power management and voltage control, as requested by the majority of grid codes/standards, are satisfied (if possible) by tuning the reactive power of the programmable units.

      "abstract": "The paper aims at defining a methodology to evaluate the lightning performance of a system of overhead distribution lines. As is well known, the evaluation of the lightning performance relies generally on a Monte Carlo approach that generates many different lightning events and calculates the corresponding overvoltages. To perform such calculation, the power system computer aided design (PSCAD) module developed in the companion paper is adopted. However, as any call to PSCAD implies a nonnegligible computational effort, here an efficient approach is presented in order to limit the number of simulations as much as possible. The obtained results are compared with the ones provided by other available techniques both on simple structures in order to highlight the main features of the method and on a typical Italian distribution network segment. The comparative analysis shows good agreement between the methods and the effectiveness of the proposed technique in terms of computational effort reduction.",

First, the theoretical formulation of the problem in the time domain is presented. Then its numerical solution together with its implementation is described. Finally, a PSCAD-EMTDC interface and platform is developed, which allows us to model a realistic network, automatically distinguish between direct and indirect strokes and account for power network precontingency conditions. The obtained results are compared with a frequency-domain solution for a simple case in order to validate the finite-difference time-domain method adopted to solve the coupling equations and the interface with PSCAD. The comparison with the well-known LIOV code for a more complex case is used as a general validation of the overall tool. In a companion paper, the developed platform will be used to evaluate the lightning performance of a portion of the Italian MV distribution network.",

      "abstract": "Microgrids (MGs) may represent a solution in the near future to many problems in the energy and electric world scenarios; such as pollution, high reliability, efficiency and so on. In particular, MGs' capability to work in an islanded configuration represents one of their most interesting features in terms of the improvement of the reliability of the system, the integration of renewable energy sources and the exploitation of the quick response and flexibility of power electronic devices in a stand-alone system. In order to study and validate innovative solutions and control strategies for islanded operation, there is a need to develop models for MG structures that can be reliable and sufficiently simple to be used for the purpose of the design and validation of innovative control systems. This paper proposes a simplified, first harmonic model for a generic structure of MG characterized by its use of only electronic power converter interfaced generation. The main advantages of the proposed method lie in the model's simplicity and its reduced solving time, thanks to the limited number of necessary parameters to describe the system. Moreover, the developed formulation allows the avoidance of specific (and often licensed) software to simulate the system. The performances of the proposed model have been validated by means of a comparative analysis of the results obtained against a more accurate representation of the system performed in the power system CAD-electromagnetic transient and DC (PSCAD-EMTDC) environment, which allows for the representation of each component with a very high level of detail. Such comparison has been performed using the University of Genoa Savona Campus Smart Polygeneration Microgrid testbed facility, due to the availability of all the necessary numerical values.",

      "abstract": "The estimation of the lightning performance of a power distribution network is of great importance to design its protection system against lightning. An accurate evaluation of the number of lightning events that can create dangerous overvoltages requires a huge computational effort, as it implies the adoption of a Monte Carlo procedure. Such a procedure consists of generating many different random lightning events and calculating the corresponding overvoltages. The paper proposes a methodology to deal with the problem in two computationally efficient ways: (i) finding out the minimum number of Monte Carlo runs that lead to reliable results; and (ii) setting up a procedure that bypasses the lightning field-to-line coupling problem for each Monte Carlo run. The proposed approach is shown to provide results consistent with existing approaches while exhibiting superior Central Processing Unit (CPU) time performances..",

      "abstract": "This letter deals with a recently proposed two-step algorithm for the reconstruction of dielectric and velocity profiles of axially moving cylinders. In particular, the aim of the present work is to investigate the limitations and capabilities in reconstructing the velocity profile. By considering a best-case scenario, it is shown that, although the algorithm should be able to work even in the presence of flows with very small axial velocity values, reliable results can only be obtained when the axial speed is larger than a lower bound. This bound is shown to be an intrinsic limitation of the algorithm which is only related to the cross-polarization isolation of the measurement system. Other simulations, based on worst-case scenarios, confirm that such a bound is independent of the type of flow considered, of the configuration of the measurement system, and of the errors coming from the step devoted to the reconstruction of the dielectric profile. Finally, the same simulations show that the algorithm is reliable in a wide range of speed values, provided sensors with large cross-polarization isolations are exploited.",

For this purpose, an equivalent electric circuit is proposed together with an experimental procedure to evaluate its input parameters. The paper also highlights the simplicity of implementation of the proposed model into a microgrid Energy Management System. This allows the optimal operation of the thermal network to be achieved on the basis of available data (desired temperature profile) instead of a less realistic basis (such as the desired thermal power profile). The validation of the proposed model is performed on the Savona Campus Smart Polygeneration Microgrid (SPM) with the following steps: (i) identification of the parameters involved in the equivalent circuit (performed by minimizing the difference between the temperature profile, as calculated with the proposed model, and the measured one in a set of training days); (ii) test of the model accuracy on a set of testing days (comparing the measured temperature profiles with the calculated ones); (iii) implementation of the model into an Energy Management System in order to optimize the thermal generation starting from a desired temperature hourly profile.",

As usual, the inverse scattering problems of interest are recast as optimization problems. An Ant Colony Optimization procedure is adopted to numerically solve these problems. It exploits a proprietary finite element code for the solution of forward scattering problems involving objects in motion. When the maximum magnitude of the axial speed is limited to one-hundredth of the speed of light in vacuum, it has been shown that it could be convenient to split the inverse problem into two parts (M. Pastorino, M. Raffetto, and A. Randazzo, IEEE Trans. Geosci. Remote Sens., 53, 2015, pp. 1452-1462): the first one related to the reconstruction of the geometrical and dielectric unknowns while the second part has to deal with the determination of the velocity profile.

      "abstract": "The present contribution proposes an adaptive two-step Energy Management System (EMS) for the optimal operation of the Savona Campus Smart Polygeneration Microgrid (SPM). The first step aims at performing an economical optimization, as it provides the active power set-point for the programmable units that minimizes the overall production cost. The second step is related to power quality issues (power factor correction or voltage support), as it produces in output the reactive power reference signal for all the devices under converter. Moreover, due to the presence of uncertainties in the electric and thermal load request and in the Renewable Energy Sources (RES) power production, an update forecasting logic is proposed that, applied at each time step of the optimization process, refines the forecast accuracy. The experimental validation performed on the SPM shows the efficacy of the proposed EMS in satisfying both the economic and the power quality objectives.",

The set splits into two parts. The first of these is made up of traditional conditions, which are not restrictive for practical applications and define the usual requirements for the domain, its boundary, its subdomains and their boundaries, the boundary conditions and the constitutive parameters. The second part consists of conditions which are specific for the problems at hand. In particular, these conditions are expressed in terms of the constitutive parameters of the media involved and of the velocity field. It is shown that it is not difficult to check the validity of these conditions and that they hold true for broad classes of practically important problems which involve axially moving media.",

Such a model is particularly useful when one has to represent the line into a more complex power system, modeled in a lumped way. To reach this goal, it is necessary to produce a reliable and computationally effective solution to the problem of the high-frequency electromagnetic field coupling with a terminated transmission line. From a mathematical standpoint, this problem can be presented by means of an integral equation whose solution can be achieved with regularization procedures for linear inverse problems. In order to obtain a computationally efficient result, the unknown current is first developed in a Fourier series and then the Landweber iterative algorithm is applied to identify the series coefficients. The proposed method is then tested taking as reference the numerical results obtained using the Numerical Electromagnetics Code (NEC-2), reaching a good agreement.",

      "abstract": "The evaluation of the indirect lightning performance of an overhead power line is typically represented by means of curves reporting how many lightning faults per year the line may experience as a function of its insulation level, and so it expresses the probability that the line is subject to an overvoltage greater than its critical flashover voltage (CFO). Obtaining this curve is a very time-consuming task from a computational point of view, since the evaluation of the lightning overvoltage requires the solution of the field-to-line coupling problem and this has to be repeated a significant number of times, taking into account the possible values assumed by all the stochastic variables that influence the process. In this contribution, some mathematical properties of the probability density functions (PDF) are exploited in order to derive a formula in which the probability that an overvoltage caused by an indirect lightning event is greater than an assigned value can be computed simply by a numerical evaluation of an integral. The results have been compared with those obtained applying a classical Monte Carlo technique, showing an excellent agreement between the two approaches with a considerable CPU time reduction.",

Such microgrid is designed to produce electric and thermal energy by means of renewable generation units, cogenerative gas turbines, a storage unit and electric vehicle charging stations. The work focuses its attention on the issue of the microgrid day-ahead power production optimization. Such problem consists in finding the power production profiles for all the dispatchable units in order to optimize a well-defined goal (economical, environmental, etc). This requires to model all the components of the grid in order to define the set of constraints for the optimization procedure. In particular, the way of representing the electric power balance equations plays a crucial role since a trade-off between accuracy and computational efforts is required. Different approaches are presented and tested on the SPM, e.g. complete load flow, modified DC load flow and single bus-bar representation, in order to highlight the peculiarity of the different optimization models obtained and evaluate their impact on computational time, result accuracy and possibility of future experimental validation.",

      "abstract": "The strong increase in the number of installed photovoltaic (PV) production plants has slowly changed the assets and the operating conditions of the electricity power system. In this context, the supply and control of the reactive power from the renewable generation plants are becoming an important issue to be exploited that can facilitate the integration of PV and wind power in electricity grids. The aim of this paper is to propose an optimized control strategy to manage the reactive power resource generated by PV plants in order to improve the quality of the low/medium voltage distribution network and meet the latest technical requirements listed by distribution system operators in their grid codes. A methodology to define the optimal reactive power references for each PV unit connected to a generic distribution network is presented for a specified goal (e.g., the achievement of suitable voltage levels at the grid nodes). Such reference signals are then provided to the PV plants regulation systems, which are designed in order to guarantee the decoupling between the active and reactive power channels, due to the use of the Feedback Linearization control technique. The problem is formulated in a generalized way, so that it can be extended to any possible grid configuration. © 2013 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "An in-depth knowledge of the littoral system is essential for its conservation and for an accurate planning of due interventions. The parabolic bay shape equation, used to study the embayed beach planform, is a qualitatively assessed instrument to obtain information about beach equilibrium conditions. Nowadays the equation has been extended in order to be applicable not only to sand beaches but also to gravel beaches. In this paper Phoebus user-friendly software for an automatic use of the extended parabolic bay shape equation is presented. The software enables both technical experts and non-professionals to conduct expeditious analysis in order to evaluate the evolution and equilibrium conditions of embayed littoral beaches lying between natural headlands or man-made structures, as well as to artificially recreate stable embayed beaches by building new artificial structures on open beaches. The software can be also used for coastal planning, to anticipate beach modifications in response to new building or to changes in pre-existing structures. Highlights: 1. Development of a free software to automatically compute embayed beach planform 2. The system can be used on every type of beach image 3. The software allows to display the planform both for sand and gravel beaches 4. Software reliability was demonstrated for natural and artificial bay beaches. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

      "abstract": "In this paper we present a hybrid approach to numerically solving two-dimensional electromagnetic inverse scattering problems, whereby the unknown scatterer is hosted by a possibly inhomogeneous background. The approach is \"hybrid\" in that it merges a qualitative and a quantitative method to optimize the way of exploiting the a priori information on the background within the inversion procedure, thus improving the quality of the reconstruction and reducing the data amount necessary for a satisfactory result. In the qualitative step, this a priori knowledge is utilized to implement the linear sampling method in its near-field formulation for an inhomogeneous background, in order to identify the region where the scatterer is located. On the other hand, the same a priori information is also encoded in the quantitative step by extending and applying the contrast source inversion method to what we call the \"inhomogeneous Lippmann-Schwinger equation\"; the latter is a generalization of the classical Lippmann-Schwinger equation to the case of an inhomogeneous background, and in our paper is deduced from the differential formulation of the direct scattering problem to provide the reconstruction algorithm with an appropriate theoretical basis. Then the point values of the refractive index are computed only in the region identified by the linear sampling method at the previous step. The effectiveness of this hybrid approach is supported by numerical simulations presented at the end of the paper. © 2013 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.",

      "abstract": "In the course of metformin treatment, staging abdominal cancer lesions with <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET images is often hindered by the presence of a high bowel radioactivity. The present study aimed to verify the mechanism underlying this phenomenon. Methods: Fifty-three mice were submitted to dynamic acquisitions of <sup>18</sup>FFDG kinetics under fasting conditions. Three small-animal PET scans were obtained over a 4-mo study period. The animals were subdivided into 4 groups according to the following metformin administration protocol: group 1, untreated mice (n = 15); group 2, mice exposed to metformin treatment (750 mg/kg/d) for the 48 h before each PET study (pulsed, n = 10); group 3, mice treated for the whole study period (prolonged, n = 10); and group 4, mice in which prolonged treatment was interrupted 48 h before PET (interrupted, n = 8). The rate constant of <sup>18</sup>F-FDG uptake was estimated by Patlak analysis. At the end of the study, the ileum and colon were harvested, washed, and counted ex vivo. Two further groups, of = animals each, were included to evaluate the effect of prolonged metformin treatment on phosphorylated adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (pAMPK) form and gene expression for thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP). Results: Pulsed treatment did not modify gut tracer retention with respect to the untreated group. Conversely, prolonged treatment induced a progressive increase in <sup>18</sup>F-FDG uptake that selectively involved the colonic wall, without any significant contamination of bowel content. This effect persisted after a complete drug washout in the interrupted group. These responses were paralleled by increased pAMPK availability and by reduced expression of TXNIP messenger RNA in colonic enterocytes exposed to prolonged metformin treatment. Conclusion: Metformin causes a selective increase in colonic <sup>18</sup>F-FDG uptake. This effect appears after a relatively long period of treatment and persists soon after drug washout. Accordingly, the increased bowel glucose metabolism reflects a biologic response to chronic metformin treatment characterized by increased levels of pAMPK and reduced levels of TXNIP.

      "abstract": "[<sup>18</sup>F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) is one of the most utilized tracers for positron emission tomography (PET) applications in oncology. FDG-PET relies on higher glycolytic activity in tumors compared to normal structures as the basis of image contrast. As a glucose analog, FDG is transported into malignant cells which typically exhibit an increased radioactivity. However, different from glucose, FDG is not reabsorbed by the renal system and is excreted to the bladder. The present paper describes a novel computational method for the quantitative assessment of this excretion process. The method is based on a compartmental analysis of FDG-PET data in which the excretion process is explicitly accounted for by the bladder compartment and on the application of an ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm for the determination of the tracer coefficients describing the FDG transport effectiveness. The validation of this approach is performed by means of both synthetic data and real measurements acquired by a PET device for small animals (micro-PET). Possible oncological applications of the results are discussed in the final section. © 2013 Sara Garbarino et al.",

The aim of the present work is to introduce an innovative optimized control strategy to exploit the reactive power resource generated by photovoltaic plants in order to improve the quality and efficiency of the low/medium voltage distribution network. Here, a methodology to define the optimal reactive power reference for every photovoltaic unit of the network is presented in order to pursue a well-defined goal, such as the minimization of the Joule losses or the voltage support. Such reference signals are then provided to the photovoltaic control systems that will guarantee the decoupling between the reactive power channel and the active power one, thanks to the use of the FeedBack Linearization (FBL) control technique. The problem is here formulated in a general way, therefore it can be extended to any possible grid configuration and test case scenario. © 2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Background. Despite advancements in comprehension of molecular mechanisms governing bone marrow (BM) homing of hematopoietic stem cells, cord blood transplant (CBT) suffers from a slow rate of hematopoietic recovery. Intrabone (IB) injection has been proposed as a method able to improve speed of BM engraftment with respect to conventional IV protocols. However, the mechanisms underlying this benefit are largely unknown. Aim. To verify whether IB-CBT determines a local engraftment able to predict the reconstitution of recipient hematopoiesis. Design and Methods. Twenty-one patients with hematologic malignancies received IB injection into both iliac crests of 3.2 ± 0.68 - 107/kg cord blood cells. One month following IB-CBT, PET-CT imaging was performed. Maximal standardized uptake values (SUVs) were assessed in BM of both iliac crests and in all lumbar vertebrae. Results. Maximal SUV within iliac crests was higher than in lumbar vertebrae (4.1 ± 1.7 versus 3.2 ± 0.7, resp., P = 0.01). However, metabolic activity in these two different BM districts was significantly correlated (r = 0.7, P < 0.001). Moreover, FDG uptake values within the injection site closely predicted platelet recovery 100 days after IB-CBT (r = 0.72, P < 0.01). Conclusions. The metabolic activity of injected BM predicts the subsequent rate of hematopoietic recovery after IB-CBT, suggesting a pivotal role of the local engraftment in the reconstitution of recipient hematopoiesis. © 2012 Cecilia Marini et al.",

      "abstract": "A suitable knowledge of coastal systems, of their morphodynamic characteristics and their response to storm events and man-made structures is essential for littoral conservation and management. Nowadays webcams represent a useful device to obtain information from beaches. Video-monitoring techniques are generally site specific and softwares working with any image acquisition system are rare. Therefore, this work aims at submitting theory and applications of an experimental video monitoring software: Beachkeeper plus, a freeware non-profit software, can be employed and redistributed without modifications. A license file is provided inside software package and in the user guide. Beachkeeper plus is based on Matlab <sup>®</sup> and it can be used for the analysis of images and photos coming from any kind of acquisition system (webcams, digital cameras or images downloaded from internet), without any a-priori information or laboratory study of the acquisition system itself. Therefore, it could become a useful tool for beach planning. Through a simple guided interface, images can be analyzed by performing georeferentiation, rectification, averaging and variance. This software was initially operated in Pietra Ligure (Italy), using images from a tourist webcam, and in Mar del Plata (Argentina) using images from a digital camera. In both cases the reliability in different geomorphologic and morphodynamic conditions was confirmed by the good quality of obtained images after georeferentiation, rectification and averaging. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

      "abstract": "Purpose Despite their relevance in clinical medicine, the extension and activity of the bone marrow (BM) cannot be directly evaluated in vivo. We propose a new method to estimate these variables by combining structural and functional maps provided by CT and PET. Methods BM extension and glucose uptake were estimated in 102 patients undergoing whole-body PET/CT because of a history of nonmetastatic melanoma. Image analysis assumed that the BM is surrounded by compact bone. An iterative optimization scheme was applied to each CT slice to identify the external border of the bone. To identify compact bone, the algorithm measured the average Hounsfield coefficient within a two-pixel ring located just inside the bone contour. All intraosseous pixels with an attenuation coefficient lower than this cut-off were flagged as 1, while the remaining pixels were set at 0. Binary masks created from all CT slices were thus applied to the PET data to determine the metabolic activity of the intraosseous volume (IBV). Results Estimated whole-body IBV was 1,632±587 cm3 and was higher in men than in women (2,004±498 cm3 vs. 1,203 ±354 cm3, P<0.001). Overall, it was strictly correlated with ideal body weight (r00.81, P00.001) but only loosely with measured body weight (r00.43, P00.01). The average FDG standardized uptake value (SUV) in the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae was 2.01±0.36, Accordingly, intraosseous voxels with SUV ≥1.11 (mean spine SUV-2.5×SD) were considered as active \"red\" BM and those with SUV <1.11 as \"yellow\" BM. Estimated red BM volume was 541±195 ml, with a higher prevalence in the axial than in the appendicular skeleton (87±8 % vs. 10±8 %, P<0.001). Again, red BM volume was higher in men than in women (7.8±2.2 vs. 6.7±2.1 ml/kg body weight, P<0.05), but in women it occupied a greater fraction of the IBV (32±7 % vs. 36±10 %, P<0.05). Patient age modestly predicted red BM SUV, while it was robustly and inversely correlated with red BM volume. Conclusion Our computational analysis of PET/CT images provides a first estimation of the extension and metabolism of the BM in a population of adult patients without haematooncological disorders. This information might represent a new window to explore pathophysiology the BM and the response of BM diseases to chemotherapy. © Springer-Verlag 2012.",

Due to the differences between the morphodynamics of sand and gravel beaches, which is strictly influenced by their different hydraulic characteristics, it was necessary to create a predictive instrument for this beach type as well.Therefore, in this study the standard Hsu and Evans equation (1989) was modified in order to make it applicable not only to sand beaches but also to gravel beaches. The shoreline was computed according to a parabolic model in polar coordinates whose coefficients are considered linearly dependent on the wave direction and related to the beach type. The estimation of the free parameters of the model was performed according to a statistical analysis of a shorelines data set of Mediterranean sand and gravel embayed beaches. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",

In a two-dimensional framework, the tumor inside the breast is regarded as an unknown scatterer placed inside an inhomogeneous and lossy background formed by skin and fat. We first present in detail the mathematical formulation of the method, which is based on the reciprocity gap functional: in particular, the physical and geometrical properties of the healthy breast are coded into the Green's function of the corresponding scattering equation, while any other object outside the array of receiving antennas can be neglected. Then, we propose a \"no-sampling\" implementation of the method, which allows a very fast visualization of the breast slices (the computational time is around 1s). Finally, we test the resulting algorithm against synthetic but realistic and noisy scattering data, by considering different plausible clinical situations. © 2010 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.",

The proposed method is organized in two stages: in the first one, the supports of the scatterers are retrieved by means of a new formulation of the Linear Sampling Method, which is based on the no sampling approach; in the second one, the complex permittivities of the targets are estimated by means of a quantitative method, which searches the solution within the constraints provided by the previous step. In such a way, the efficiency of the new version of the Linear Sampling Method is combined with the accuracy of quantitative procedures.

The study was carried out with a webcam, one of the most innovative techniques for monitoring coastal evolution. This technique makes it possible to automatically obtain a continuous, real-time set of images of high quality that can then be processed with dedicated software to provide information on the morphodynamic conditions of the beach. The image processing technique, [based on the studies carried out by the Coastal Imaging Laboratory of Oregon State University to develop the Argus System], was developed by the Dipartimento per lo Studio del Territorio e delle sue Risorse (Dip.Te.Ris.) and the Dipartimento di Matematica (Di.Ma.) of the University of Genoa. The research was focused on studying the variations in the shoreline following a nourishment programme as revealed by a comparison of the processed images, which made it possible to reconstruct the evolution of the beach in the short- and medium-term and thereby evaluate the efficiency of the intervention.",

      "abstract": "A two-step reconstruction scheme is introduced to solve fixed frequency inverse scattering problems in Born approximation conditions. The aim of the approach is to achieve super-resolution effects by constraining the inversion method to exploit some a priori knowledge on the scatterer. Therefore, the first step is to apply the linear sampling method to the far-field data in order to obtain an estimate of the support of the inhomogeneity. The second step is to apply the projected Landweber method to the linearized scattering equation in order to obtain super-resolution effects via out-of-band extrapolation. The effectiveness of the approach, which has a rather wide applicability power, is tested in the case of a two-dimensional problem for some scatterers of simple geometry. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

      "abstract": "The linear sampling method is a qualitative procedure for the visualization of both impenetrable and inhomogeneous scatterers, which requires the regularized solution of a linear illposed integral equation of the first kind. An open issue in this technique is the one of determining the optimal scatterer profile from the visualization maps in an automatic manner. In the present paper this problem is addressed in two steps. First, linear sampling is optimized by using a new regularization algorithm for the solution of the integral equation, which provides more accurate maps for different levels of the noise affecting the data. Then an edge detection technique based on active contours is applied to the optimized maps. Our computation exploits a recently introduced implementation of the linear sampling method, which enhances both the accuracy and the numerical effectiveness of the approach. © 2008 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.",
