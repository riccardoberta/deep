      "abstract": "The use of multiple access protocols information in Internet of Things (IoT) environments has gained significant interest over the past decade, particularly for crowd behavior monitoring. Due to its high data rates and low infrastructure requirements, WiFi is considered one of the most promising wireless technologies for leveraging the explosive growth of transmitted data from mobile devices. However, with the introduction of MAC address randomization and the application of new randomization policies on assigning randomized sequence numbers (SNs) to transmitted frames in mobile devices to enhance privacy, traditional approaches to device identification face significant challenges. To tackle this issue, we conduct a comprehensive analysis at the multiple access level and propose CrowdWatch which is an innovative framework designed to enhance the understanding and utilization of MAC randomization dynamics. Additionally, we introduce a novel approach that leverages multiple device-specific features to accurately associate frames with randomized MAC addresses to their corresponding devices. By integrating multimodal fingerprints, the framework can effectively identify mobile devices and track their behavior. The presented approach ensures reliable detection even under the latest randomization policies. We examined the introduced framework through real-world experiments, and the findings prove that it is an effective solution for smart building management and occupancy estimation in dynamic environments.",

As mobile devices become increasingly sophisticated, their capacity for wireless communication presents both opportunities for enhanced connectivity and privacy-related challenges. This study examines critical features of probe request frames and their role in device fingerprinting. We highlight the challenges and advancements in communicating between mobile devices and nearby networks by analyzing the randomization policies employed by various operating systems and their effectiveness in masking device identities. Through comprehensive experiments conducted across multiple mobile devices and operating system versions, we capture and analyze probe request frames under different user-device interaction phases. Our findings indicate variations in transmission frequency and the impact of connection states on broadcasting characteristics. We also investigate the deployed randomization policies in different brands of mobile devices, uncovering their influence on privacy preservation. This research provides notable insights for developing more effective wireless communication approaches, contributing to the broader goal of enhancing user privacy in this field.",

Specifically, monitoring respiration is a critical component of this evolution, offering a straightforward yet effective method for assessing an individual's health status. In this paper, we introduce an innovative contactless approach to respiration monitoring that leverages Channel State Information (CSI) from Wi-Fi channels. By analyzing variations in the amplitude and phase of CSI data, we infer human respiration patterns. To validate our method, we conducted experiments with multiple subjects in indoor environments, assessing the system's capability to track the respiration cycle and determine breathing frequency. We also compared the performance of various AI algorithms in identifying accurate breath rates. Our findings indicate that the CSI-based system is a promising solution for respiration monitoring, achieving an average accuracy of approximately 84% in estimating breathing frequency, thus paving the way for future studies to enhance the robustness of the proposed approach.",

      "abstract": "The convergence of Symbiotic Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI) foundational models, and 6G is ushering in a new era of intelligent connectivity, where networks, devices, and algorithms operate in close coordination to enable real-time, adaptive, and efficient systems. In the context of structural health monitoring (SHM), this integrated vision provides a powerful framework to tackle challenges, such as limited resources, harsh environments, and the need for timely, high-fidelity data. By enabling intelligent, collaborative processing across edge and network layers, it supports efficient data compression, transmission, and decision-making—ensuring robust and adaptive monitoring even in complex structural settings. In this work, we investigate the use of AI for data compression in an IoT-based SHM scenario. Specifically, we evaluate and compare the performance of four different convolutional autoencoder (convolutional AEs (CAEs)) in compressing and reconstructing inertial signals collected from various structural systems, aiming to enable adaptive and context-aware processing directly at the edge. By testing across heterogeneous sources, we assess the generalizability and robustness of each CAE model, providing insights into the potential of deep learning-based compression techniques for SHM applications.",

      "abstract": "Mobile devices with enabled Wi-Fi continuously discover nearby access points by broadcasting management frames known as probe requests. This broadcasting leaks fingerprints that can be used to identify the presence and movement of flow in a given area. To protect users' privacy and location, probe requests use randomized MAC addresses generated according to the randomization protocols. In this paper, we analyze the behavior and characteristics of probe request frames across different devices from various vendors, operating systems, and features, as well as the influence of user-device interaction in different phases. In particular, we provide a detailed examination of the adoption of MAC address randomization techniques to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of recent randomization policies and to demonstrate that, despite the OS implementation, there is still potential to utilize open Wi-Fi in different services and development.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, the increase in the elderly population has placed significant burdens on post-rehabilitation schemes, resulting in high logistical costs and considerable social impacts due to hospitalization or frequent visits. These challenges call for a transformation in the traditional approach to physical patient care, which can be achieved by leveraging the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), particularly through the use of pervasive wearable sensors. When attached to patients during treatment or therapy, these sensors can provide valuable supplementary information to healthcare professionals. When it comes to adopting IoMT technologies, cost efficiency, portability, and generalization are key factors. Specifically, this study aims to enhance the cost-effectiveness and versatility of wearable eHealth monitoring architectures that utilize foot pressure-sensing hardware for the motor assessment of post-stroke and neurologically impaired patients. It leverages lower limb inertial measurement unit sensory information and machine learning to mitigate the reliance on foot pressure-sensing hardware. We demonstrate the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in predicting fine-scale foot pressure using only inexpensive, off-the-shelf motion sensors. We propose a self-supervised, exercise-agnostic asynchronous foot pressure decoding model that does not require human annotation. The algorithm is thoroughly evaluated using appropriate performance metrics, and our experimental tests show promising results.",

      "abstract": "Structural health monitoring (SHM) is a process aimed at studying variations in the expected behavior of a structure in order to locate damage, material deterioration and other abnormalities. To this aim, SHM is usually performed continuously, thus generating large amounts of data, often by employing wired, expensive and proprietary systems. Introducing low-cost, low-energy consumption and low-rate IoT devices allows for cheaper and easier installations also in scenarios where computation and transmission resources are limited. Since many structural signals (e.g., vibrations) are sparse in the frequency domain, it is possible to apply well-known compressive sensing (CS) techniques to limit the amount of information to be transmitted. CS allows recovering a vector using a reduced amount of entries, thus being able to perform sub-Nyquist sampling. This article shows the results obtained by applying CS to inertial signals coming from wireless IoT devices, developed as laboratory prototypes, applied to real structures (specifically, a bridge). Such findings are further expanded by discussing the efficiency of CS with respect to the number of used samples and its feasibility for IoT applications, from the transmission burden and energy consumption standpoints.",

      "abstract": "Despite recent advancements, Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) remains a difficult task, particularly when dealing with drone videos. A variety of challenges, such as data association, varying levels of occlusion, camera motion, and missing detection, affect the effectiveness of MOT tasks. Data association in tracking-by-detection approaches plays a critical role in determining how detections from previous frames are linked to generate coherent tracks. To address this challenge, merging spatial and visual cues may not lead to identical matching pairs for the given detections and tracks. Thus, the performance of the MOT task can be improved by pairing them individually and then determining the best matching pair. It is therefore proposed a Multi-Class MOT (MCMOT) tracker with a cascaded data association strategy in which, during the first stage, matching pairs based on appearance and spatial information are identified separately. The best matching pair is then identified out of these pairs in the second stage and updated as an active track. In addition, the Kalman Filter (KF) estimation and Constant Velocity Assumption (CVA) model are employed to effectively address scenarios involving missed detections and occlusion handling by utilizing motion data. Experiments were carried out on the two state-of-the-art datasets, VisDrone-MOT and UA-DETRAC, to validate the effectiveness of the proposed MCMOT tracker, which demonstrated the improved performance when compared against six different state-of-the-art trackers by providing as input different detectors.",

      "abstract": "Human balance is essential for everyday activities, from basic functions like standing and walking to more complex movements required in sports and work tasks. Optimal balance reduces the risk of falls, a major cause of injuries among the elderly and individuals with certain medical conditions. However, traditional force platforms can be prohibitively expensive for smaller clinics and individual practitioners, and patients with mobility issues may find it difficult to access locations equipped with such platforms. In light of these challenges, this work explores the effectiveness and versatility of using simpler hardware for pressure sensing. As an alternative to conventional force platforms, low-cost wearable sensors, such as Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs), have been explored. This research focuses on developing a simple yet effective balance evaluation system using smart-glasses embedded with an IMU sensor to replace traditional feet pressure sensing machines. Furthermore, we developed a custom dataset for the estimation of sway parameters by simultaneously collecting the IMU data and labels from the force platform for a set of 20 participants. We experimented with various Deep Learning (DL) models, leveraging the latest advancements in Machine Learning (ML), to estimate sway parameters such as sway path, sway area, and their ratio, typically measured by the gold standard force platform. When evaluated with appropriate performance criteria, the experimental results indicate that our proposed methodology performs robustly using only accelerometer data.",

      "abstract": "Brain stroke is a pathology affecting a significant number of people worldwide. A fast diagnosis is required to administer the correct therapy and frequent monitoring is usually necessary during follow-up. Microwave imaging represents a promising technology able to address such needs and that may complement gold-standard systems. In this framework, a novel Lebesgue-space approach for microwave imaging of stroke is presented in this paper. The developed method combines an inexact-Newton inversion technique in variable-exponent Lebesgue spaces with a data-driven regularization term. In this way, a-priori information about the configuration under test, e.g., the head structure, can be exploited and the convergence of the method can be enhanced. The method is preliminarily evaluated by means of numerical simulations involving realistic head phantoms. The obtained results confirm that the developed approach allows identifying and characterizing the stroke with a good accuracy.",

Disparities in class distribution, particularly between long-tail and head classes (foreground-foreground disparity), impede the efficacy of less prevalent categories. Thus, the goal of this work is to improve the performance of tail categories in long-tail aerial datasets while enhancing or at-least maintaining the performance of head categories. To achieve this, a weighting and re-weighting strategy is proposed that focuses on the foreground-foreground disparity in classes at the dataset level, thereby enhancing the accuracy of less prevalent categories. The proposed strategy is evaluated using two long-tail aerial datasets, the drone-based VisDrone DETection (VisDroneDET) and the Satellite Imagery Multivehicles Dataset (SIMD), and one-stage object detection models. Compared to baseline models, most tail categories show significant performance improvements, highlighting the importance of the weighting strategy to address class imbalances in long-tail object detection.",

      "abstract": "Object recognition is a quite critical task that involves the identification and potential localization of a target inside a monitored area. Target detection usually relies on material, shape and size identification in order to infer higher level information, and it can be employed in many different frameworks and applications. In this connection, we carry out a performance evaluation campaign on WiFi Channel State Information (CSI)-based object recognition techniques used to automatically identify material, category and specific objects among daily life items. The main contribution of this work is to provide a thorough comparison of the performance of different machine learning algorithms on recognition using a real-life experimental testbed. The performance study shows that the Random Forest (RF) classifier proves very accurate in terms of correct target recognition, independently of the considered task. The employed deep learning algorithm, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), is similarly able to attain very good results. In particular, accuracy values reach 94.8% in material identification, 97.1% in category differentiation and 98.1% in object recognition tasks.",

      "abstract": "A great deal of signals coming from structural monitoring scenarios are sparse in the frequency domain, suggesting the application of Compressive Sensing (CS) techniques in order to reduce the quantity of transmitted information. CS can recover data vectors starting from a subset of the original vector entries, thus allowing to recover a previously sampled signal with much less samples than those suggested by the Nyquist-Shannon theorem, and much less than what is commonly used in dynamic identification of structures. A CS technique, specifically Basis Pursuit, is applied for the dynamic identification study of a 30-meter-high lightning rod, consisting of a steel monotubular pole, where possible issues had been raised concerning fatigue damage due to resonant response with the first and second modes of vibration. An experimental measurement campaign was carried out to estimate damping coefficients useful for structural verifications. The ambient response was collected using triaxial accelerometers positioned at the top and at an intermediate height, which transmit data via WiFi to a nearby workstation. Different sampling frequencies for the compressed records are utilized for the dynamic identification of the structure, comparing modal frequencies and damping ratios with values obtained from the original records to find the best trade-off between data reduction and accuracy of modal parameters. Despite the usual challenges inherent in identification problems, further complicated by the low damping levels of the structure under consideration, the comparisons demonstrate a very good approximation. Fundamental frequencies are accurately estimated, while the slight discrepancies in the damping coefficients are associated with the intrinsic uncertainties of this parameter. Regarding the structural aspect of the case study, the outcomes of the analysis indicate very low damping values, pointing to potential criticality, particularly in the second mode of vibration. Moreover, the solid approximation achieved with the CS technique marks a significant advancement in applying IoT solutions for structural monitoring, emphasizing a significant reduction in data flow without affecting data quality. This may lead to several benefits, including simpler installation and maintenance, lower costs, and decreased energy consumption.",

      "abstract": "Contactless patient monitoring is one of the most trending topics in eHealth, due to the utmost importance of non-invasive tele-enabled biomedical systems in next-generation healthcare. In this connection, this work investigates Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using commodity 5GHz WiFi devices, exploiting Channel State Information (CSI) to distinguish among a set of actions performed by different people. The position and movements of the human body affect wireless signal reflections and, consequently, CSI. Data collected from wireless packets are organized into the CSI matrix, which describes the status of the link at each time instant. In this work we employ amplitude and phase information, related to the variations in CSI values, to classify human activities leveraging simple machine learning techniques. Different radio link modes are also compared to evaluate their impact on the classification performance. Experimental results show that CSI data is capable of providing very accurate results in classifying activities performed by different people, especially when considering phase-related information in a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) configuration, thus making CSI-based HAR a promising solution for contactless patient monitoring.",

      "abstract": "Alongside many traditional as well as novel applications, in the latest years, drones have been widely adopted as remote sensing platforms for road traffic monitoring in urban areas and on highways. The problem of traffic monitoring on Region of Interest (RoI) based on drone imagery is a challenging task, especially when the surveillance drone is constantly moving. In this work, two specific subtasks have been addressed. The goal of the first stage is to predict the RoI in drone imagery of traffic scenes using deep-learning (DL)-based approaches instead of traditional image processing; in this connection, the goal of the second task is to perform vehicle detection on the selected RoI. To ensure diversity and robustness, drone images with different altitudes, positions, and view points have been considered. To achieve these goals, two custom aerial data sets for RoI extraction and detection were built by collecting aerial sequences from flying unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and by transmitting them to the base station leveraging 5G technology. Two different ad hoc DL-based architectures have been designed for the RoI extraction task to maximize the accuracy and inference speed, respectively, and have been evaluated on two different data sets: 1) a custom-built data set and 2) a Massachusetts roads data set. Finally, the models providing the best performance have been combined to further improve the overall results. Experimental tests show that the proposed framework represents a promising solution for drone-based road traffic monitoring in critical areas, exploiting imagery from a variety of viewing angles and altitudes.",

      "abstract": "The eHealth systems are in great demand, particularly during times of outbreak like COVID-19, when there is a shortage of caregivers. The technological advancements, such as wearable wireless devices, the Internet of Things, and improved machine learning methods have made these systems more reliable. In modern times, these systems can play a vital role in post-rehabilitation journeys, which have significant social impact and high costs in traditional settings. Cost efficiency, portability, and generalization are key factors in adopting new technology. In this study, we investigate the potential for optimizing and simplifying hardware in order to increase the cost-effectiveness and versatility of post-stroke eHealth rehabilitation systems. It leverages the rich information available from Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors to compensate the need for foot pressure sensing. We present the first attempt to demonstrate the potential of machine learning, aided by affordable off the shelf motion sensing devices, for foot pressure analysis. Our proposed foot pressure decoding model is trained in an exercise-agnostic, self-supervised manner that eliminates the need for human annotation. The algorithm is evaluated using appropriate performance metrics, and our experimental results show very promising performance.",

      "abstract": "Compressive Sensing (CS) is a sampling technique which, provided the sparsity of the arrival domain and specific properties of the reconstruction matrix, allows rebuilding a vector starting from a significantly small subset of measures. This paves the way to a plethora of applications, ranging from specialized frameworks, such as medical imaging, to more general purposes, such as data compression. Among these, Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is a primary and current topic, focused on analyzing structures to determine their residual lifespan and their health conditions (material degradation, damage localization, disaster prevention, etc.), In this regard, CS is able to provide accurate results, at the same time limiting the amount of data needed to propagate information between different end-points. Indeed, SHM usually deals with continuous flows of information originating from heterogeneous sensors and locations, often characterized by diverse computational power and signal coverage. In this paper we apply CS to signals coming from two different structures, i.e., a laboratory model and a bridge. Results show that CS is a viable way of reconstructing the considered signals by exploiting a subset of samples while still maintaining a high degree of precision, achieving an average normalized RMSE of 0.12.",

      "abstract": "Compressive Sensing (CS) is a sampling technique that challenges the traditional sampling scheme introduced by the Whittaker-Shannon theorem. Under certain conditions, a signal can be sampled at rates lower than the Nyquist rate, introducing a different kind of approach to signal handling, both in the acquisition and in the reconstruction phases. CS relies on the property of sparsity, the idea that a signal possesses an amount of information which is smaller than the amount of data required to store it. This paper employs the CS approach to inertial signals sensed by innovative IoT devices by showing applications of real-world infrastructure monitoring. Numerical results show that our approach is able to efficiently estimate the infrastructures modal frequencies with an innovative inertial IoT prototype by achieving a compression level around 20 times below the Nyquist rate.",

      "abstract": "Stroke diagnostics may benefit from an early detection and a continuous monitoring of the disease, which is possible thanks to the application of electromagnetic imaging systems. However, the inverse problem that should be tackled to retrieve a quantitative microwave image of the dielectric properties of the head tissues presents many challenging points, i.e., ill-posedness, non-linearity, and weak stroke response. In the framework of Lebesgue-space methods with adaptive exponent functions, the present paper proposes the adoption of a simultaneous processing of multifrequency data. Initial results coming from a numerical assessment with a detailed three-dimensional phantom of the human head are presented and discussed, analyzing the case of a simulated hemorrhagic event.",

      "abstract": "From smart cities development perspective, road vehicle detection exploiting drone-based aerial imagery is a crucial part of traffic surveillance and monitoring systems where effective results are of utmost demand. A recent boom in the field of deep learning (DL) has provided remarkable development in the problem of vehicle detection. Aerial views pose more complexity with respect to the ground view but the rapid advancement in the field of DL, the volume of data, and hardware configuration has facilitated the realization of these intelligent detection systems effectively. In this article, a detailed performance evaluation of some of the main state-of-the-art DL-based object detection techniques has been carried out along with an experimental analysis of vehicle detection using the RetinaNet framework on the VisDrone-benchmark data set. The performance of the RetinaNet framework has been validated together with the results provided by the VisDrone team. Further experiments are then conducted to investigate the impact of various parameters. Finally, the selection of suitable models that can be practically implemented is also discussed based both on a qualitative and quantitative analysis.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly utilized in smart cities to perform traffic monitoring tasks such as multiple object detection and tracking. The task's criticality is dependent on the drones' dynamic altitude, movable camera, and various viewing angles. These challenges are addressed once the UAVs' collected data is received. However, parameters affecting drone data collecting flight operations must also be explored, including drone actual flight time, data collection time, and energy consumption profile. The drone flight time would depend upon the battery capacity and energy consumption profile, which comprises drone movement, data collection, and communication energies. Besides, data collection energy consumption is subjected to video quality, frame rates, and data compression. The installed battery in UAVs is of limited capacity and determining actual flight time, data collection time, and energy consumption profile based on the factors mentioned above is critical. This paper develops and examines a drone energy consumption profile and proposes a drone flight strategy in a surveillance scenario to correctly estimate the drone's actual flight time, data collection time, and the distance the drone could travel from its original location. The results of this analysis are presented as a test case for flying a drone to collect the traffic monitoring data.",

      "abstract": "Drones and video processing have become a vital and integrated aspect of smart city development in several applications such as search and rescue, surveillance and delivery. Newly, camera-equipped drones are flown, and high-resolution photos and video data are relayed via a communication link to the base station. Apart from tackling the video processing issues in applications, such as object identification and tracking, energy consumption that may present a stumbling block in completing a successful drone flight for data collecting must be highlighted and considered. Drones have a limited amount of energy storage, which must be used to power the drone's movement, hovering, data collection, and communication. This study aims at building and testing a drone energy profile that estimates the total energy consumed and a maximum flying time of a drone in a traffic monitoring scenario. Additionally, the relationship between the video processing task and the drone energy profile is explored to determine the optimal strategy for flying the drones while maintaining the video processing task's performance. The conclusion of this evaluation and investigation can be conceived of as the test-case scenario to fly a drone for surveillance and monitoring applications to attain the optimum results.",

      "abstract": "Drone deployment has become crucial in a variety of applications, including solutions to traffic issues in metropolitan areas and highways. On the other hand, data collected via drones suffers from several problems, including a wide range of object scales, angle variations, truncation, and occlusion. To process and manipulate visual data from the drones, a variety of image processing algorithms have been employed, each with a distinct aim. Additionally, recent breakthroughs in the field of Artificial Intelligence, particularly deep learning, have attracted broad interest and are being applied to many domains in the framework of smart cities, including road traffic monitoring. The purpose of this study is to conduct a systematic review of drone-based traffic monitoring systems from a deep learning perspective. This work focuses on vehicle detection, tracking, and counting, since they are fundamental building blocks towards founding solutions for traffic congestion, flow rate and vehicle speed estimation. Additionally, drone-based datasets are examined, which face issues and problems caused by the diversity of features inherent of drone devices. The review analysis presented in this work summarizes the literature solutions provided and deployed so far and discusses future research trends in establishing a comprehensive traffic monitoring system in support of the development of smart cities.",

In this connection, we propose a low-cost, versatile and self-sustaining platform based on the Narrow Band-IoT (NB-IoT) technology aimed at efficiently and continuously monitoring the conditions of critical civil structures. We also provide both lab and in-site experimental tests comparing the performance obtained with our prototype with respect to professional monitoring equipment.

In general, drones can represent a threat for public safety due to their potential misuse. This motivation gives rise to the need of devising specific methods and techniques to monitor sensitive areas, in order to deploy effective drone surveillance systems. These systems are designed to detect nearby undesired targets, and to neutralize impending threats. One of the main tasks involved in this scenarios is target localization, which can be performed with different approaches.

      "abstract": "Brain stroke treatments are strongly time-dependent. Indeed, the literature stresses the need for quick diagnosis to guarantee the most effective therapy with the famous motto 'time is brain' [1]. Numerically speaking, a crucial goal for strokes is trying to achieve a door-to-needle time shorter than 60 minutes, called The Golden Hour [2], within which patients have the highest probability of a full recovery. This article presents a prototype of a Smart Helmet, a wearable device originally introduced in [3], [4], thought to be employed on site, to efficiently recognize and detect a brain stroke in a patient when the first aid medical team arrives. This work presents two different but complementary approaches: signal-processing-based and electromagnetic (EM). The former aims at outputting a two-level diagnosis: the presence (or not) of a stroke and (if it is present) of which type (ischemic or hemorrhagic), while the latter provides an accurate imaging of the brain that must be interpreted by medical staff. Both approaches are analyzed and compared, showing their strengths and highlighting their weaknesses.",

      "abstract": "The leading trends in the framework of the Internet of Things are driving the research community to provide smart systems and solutions aimed at revolutionizing medical sciences and healthcare. One of the major opportunities offered by IoT lies in the ubiquitous connectivity, thus enabling smart services such as remote patient monitoring, in-home therapy/rehabilitation, and assisted living platforms. In this paper we present a prototype of wearable smart glasses able to monitor the Eye Blinks (EBs) through ElectroOculoGram (EOG) signal in a transparent way with respect to the final user. We propose a novel pre-filtering scheme to reduce EOG noise along with an analytical derivation of a matched filter to detect and count EBs. We have carried out an in-depth experimental campaign in order to validate the robustness of our approach with respect to the main solutions available in the literature. Furthermore, we have compared the performances obtained with out wearable prototype versus the results achievable with professional medical equipments. Results show that our solution is able to achieve very high accuracy in EB detection, obtaining comparable performance with respect to professional medical desktop equipment, with the additional benefit of portability, comfort and easiness of use for the patients.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, have become dominant recently in all fields including military, commercial, and other multiapplications, such as agriculture, search and rescue, infrastructures monitoring, and surveillance, especially for safety and security purposes. On one hand, deployment of UAVs has facilitated end-users and, on the other hand, this enormous increase in the usage of UAVs has raised many concerns with regard to security, harm, threats, and privacy issues by different agencies, governments, private organizations even by people in their residencies, which has stimulated and motivated many researchers toward the designing of anti-drone systems in order to be secure from such risks. The main objective of this chapter is to provide a comprehensive survey concerning the work carried out in the designing of an anti-drone system for detection, localization, and tracking using Radio Frequency (RF-) and WiFi-based techniques. In the category of drone detection, drone identification, and classification are also being explored. In more detail, this chapter will highlight the key factors of the surveyed techniques and the characteristics of such systems to deploy them, practically. Indeed, current studies provide systematic ways to understand the procedures, methods, tools, and techniques, as well as experimental setups, which have been carried out for the implementation of drone-surveillance systems. A comparison of the performance, found in the literature, of the designed systems in this field is presented and analyzed. Finally, open challenges, possible future research trends, and direction are highlighted in the context of drone detection, localization, and tracking systems. The presented survey chapter is aimed at providing a guide for the research community as it could be an ignition to work further with specific direction so making these crucial systems versatile and ready to be deployed practically to meet their potential market demand.",

      "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) framework is moving the research community to provide smart systems and solutions aimed at revolutionizing medical sciences and healthcare. Given the extreme diffusion of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), the demand for a solution to early detect neurological symptoms of such diseases strongly arose. According to the medical literature, such early detection can be obtained through the correlation between PD and AD and some external symptoms: the Essential Tremor (ET) and the number of Eye Blinks (EBs). In this paper, which can be considered as an extended version of [1], we present a prototype of wearable smart glasses able to detect the presence of ET of the head and to count the number of EBs at the same time, in a transparent way with respect to the final user. Numerical results demonstrate the reliability of the proposed approach: the proposed algorithms are able to i) correctly recognize the ET with an overall accuracy above 97% and ii) count the number of EBs with an overall error around 9%.",

      "abstract": "The integration of satellite communications into 5G ecosystem is pivotal to boost enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) services in highly dynamic scenarios and in areas not optimally supported by terrestrial infrastructures. Given the heterogeneity of the networks involved, network slicing is key networking paradigm to ensure different grades of quality of service (QoS) based on the users' and verticals' requirements. In this light, this paper proposes an optimisation framework able to exploit the available resources allocated to the defined network slices so as to meet the diverse QoS/QoE requirements exposed by the network actors. Resource allocation schemes built upon neural network algorithms are validated through extensive simulation campaigns that have shown the superiority of the proposed concepts with respect to other solution candidates available from the literature.",

However, the mobile framework suffers from typical constraints on energy and computational capabilities due to the inherent characteristics of wireless mobile devices. For this reason, in order to be suitable for deploying in such framework, a place recognition algorithm should be thrifty in terms of resource consumption. In this paper we consider six different WiFi-based outdoor positioning approaches and we analytically derive an upper-bound for their computational burden in terms of number of FLoating-point OPerations (FLOPs).",

      "abstract": "This article describes a microwave tomographic approach for the quantitative imaging of brain stroke inside the human head. For the acquisition of the scattered-field information, a prototype of multistatic system is adopted. An array of custom antennas is placed in contact with the head, and a switching matrix is used to measure the scattering parameters for each pair of probes. The collected data are processed by an inversion method based on a variable-exponent Lebesgue-space regularization technique, whose outcome is a map of dielectric properties of a slice of the head. With respect to previous approaches, this kind of inversion procedure performs an adaptive update of the Lebesgue-space exponents on the basis of the results at each inexact-Newton iteration and exploits stepped frequency data. This allows for an automatic setting of the regularization level, which becomes variable and target-dependent inside the whole investigation domain. The proposed approach is validated by means of FDTD synthetic simulations with a realistic 3-D forward scattering model of the human head, as well as by using real experimental cylindrical test phantoms filled with saline and glycerin/water mixtures.",

The healthcare system is among the main scenarios that are benefiting from this new trend, thus giving rise to the concept of eHealth. In this framework we propose SmartPANTS, an IoT-based wireless system specifically designed for the rehabilitation of lower limbs. Our system is conceived as a prototype of a medical platform to be employed during the physical therapy for patients recovering from a brain stroke condition. SmartPANTS includes a signal processing and machine learning algorithm able to automatically recognize the type of exercise the patient is performing, and to provide real-time feedback on the execution. Moreover, experimental tests show that our platform is able to estimate the execution time of the different exercises, providing values very close to real ones. Performance results show that the SmartPANTS system is able to correctly identify the type of exercise currently being performed with an accuracy of about 99%.",

In such smart environments, user localization plays a central role. More specifically, Point-of-Interest (POI) recognition is one of the most attractive Location-Based-Service (LBS) applications. This paper provides computational complexity upper bounds for fingerprint-based POI recognition algorithms. We have considered five algorithms reported in a former work: LRACI and its extended variant ELRACI, BeaconPrint, PlaceSense, SensLoc and SAPFI. For each of them a close-form of their computational complexity has been derived, both for the training and the recognition phase. The results obtained in this works allow a comprehensive and fair comparison of some of the most well-known POI recognition algorithms.",

Though plenty of solutions exist for recognizing indoor places, almost no idea is present in the literature for recognizing big outdoor places without the GPS employment.

This paper proposes a Place of Interest (POI) recognition algorithm called Enhanced-LRACI.

The main contributions of this work are: i) it solves the problem of big outdoor POI recognition without using GPS by leveraging on the concept of spot, ii) it proposes a novel fingerprint (FP) algorithm and iii) it outperforms the results obtained by other reference works in terms of recognition accuracy. Performance investigation reported in this paper, carried out on real data acquired over mobile devices (Android smartphones), shows that our proposal is able to correctly recognize big outdoor POIs in 95% of the cases whereas other state of the art papers do not exceed 89%.",

      "abstract": "The growing interest in concepts such as smart cities and smart mobility is giving more and more importance to place of interest (POI) information, which proves to be crucial in providing efficient and tailored location-based services (LBSs). Though plenty of solutions exist for recognizing indoor places, the literature lacks of approaches aimed at recognizing big outdoor places without the GPS employment. Even if GPS-based solutions assure great accuracy, they have a strong request in terms of energy necessary to achieve such result. As a consequence, if LBSs are thought on the move (e.g., mobile devices such as smartphones are used) energy consumption is a key constraint. This paper proposes a POI recognition algorithm called enhanced location recognition algorithm for automatic check-in applications (E-LRACI). It is an evolution of LRACI (Location Recognition Algorithm for automatic Check-In applications, originally reported in [I. Bisio, F. Lavagetto, M. Marchese, and A. Sciarrone, ''GPS/HPS-andwifi fingerprint-based location recognition for check-in applications over smartphones in cloud-based LBSS,'' IEEE Transactions on Multimedia, vol. 15, no. 4, pp. 858-869, Jun. 2013]) which aims at recognizing big outdoor places by only exploiting radio beacons emitted by WiFi access points. In terms of contributions, this paper first, proposes a novel fingerprint algorithm; second, solves the problem of big outdoor POI recognition without using GPS by leveraging the concept of spot; and third, compares the results obtained by E-LRACI and other reference works both in terms of recognition accuracy and computational complexity. The obtained numerical results, carried out on real data (acquired with Android-based smartphones), prove that E-LRACI provides the best results since it is able to guarantee the highest accuracy (95% versus, at most, 89%) at a lowest computational complexity with respect to the existing POI recognition algorithms.",

      "abstract": "In the latest years, the popularity of commercial drones has grown rapidly due to their cheaper costs and great availability on the market. The great diffusion of remotely piloted devices unfortunately leads to several security and safety concerns that need to be tackled. In this paper, we consider a fingerprint-based drone detection approach relying on the analysis of WiFi traffic features to identify the presence of unauthorized devices. In particular, we study the statistical distribution of the features composing the fingerprint vector, and we propose an adversarial approach to drone detection in order to invalidate the reliability of the surveillance system, by introducing fake ad-hoc traffic features. Results show that our novel approach is able to deceive the drone detection system through the introduction of flows belonging to arbitrary traffic classes. Also, the proposed adversarial method provides the expected significant impact on the performance of the system, actually reducing the recognition accuracy to about 50%.",

      "abstract": "The telecommunication infrastructure in emergency scenarios is necessarily composed of heterogeneous radio/mobile portions. Mobile Nodes (MNs) equipped with multiple network interfaces can assure continuous communications when different Radio Access Networks (RANs) that employ different Radio Access Technologies (RATs) are available. In this context, the paper proposes the definition of a Decision Maker (DM), within the protocol stack of the MN, in charge of performing network selections and handover decisions. The DM has been designed to optimize one or more performance metrics and it is based on Multiattribute Decision Making (MADM) methods. Among several MADM techniques considered, taken from the literature, the work is then focused on the TOPSIS approach, which allows introducing some improvements aimed at reducing the computational burden needed to select the RAT to be employed. The enhanced method is called Dynamic-TOPSIS (D-TOPSIS). Finally, the numerical results, obtained through a large simulative campaign and aimed at comparing the performance and the running time of the D-TOPSIS, the TOPSIS, and the algorithms found in the literature, are reported and discussed.",

The pervasive use of these devices has created many privacy and safety concerns that need to be addressed by means of proper surveillance systems able to cope with such threats.

      "abstract": "Nowadays, Internet of Things (IoT) devices can collect a large amount of data and infer the context they are operating in. One of the most pervasive IoT device is the smartphone. Among the plethora of sensors that such device has, microphone is probably the most versatile. It can be used to infer information about the context by acquiring the environmental sound. In this paper, we propose an active ultrasonic-based method able to sense context information. The approach is based on the emission of periodic ultrasonic impulses, called pings, whose echoes are continuously acquired to extract a proper set of features. Using a classifier the context information is then retrieved. Two applications are presented: 1) an indoor/outdoor detector and 2) an earphone wearing state detector. In both cases a smartphone is the employed device. The former senses if the smartphone is in an indoor or outdoor environment while the latter detects if a user is wearing or not his earphones. The obtained results are encouraging for both the solutions that have been stressed in different working conditions and employed within proper application frameworks.",

      "abstract": "IPID5180477. Several research teams around the world are currently involved in developing imaging systems, with different specific final objectives and considered modalities. Although excellent results have been reported in the scientific literature (see, for example, [1], [2], and the references therein), there are theoretical and practical difficulties that still make these techniques a challenge. The former are related to the processing of data (limited amount of information, low signal-to-noise ratios, ill-posedness, etc.), whereas the latter are essentially related to the effective realization and use of the system. In this paper, we discuss some recent results related to a tomographic system which is currently under development. In particular, a new reconstruction procedure based on a conjugate gradient approach, directly implemented in the framework of the L p Banach spaces, is presented. This inversion procedure, preliminary discussed in [3], seems to be particularly suitable for obtaining a regularized solution of the inverse scattering problem, with less artefacts and noise (on the final image) due to a reduction of the usually encountered over-smoothing effects. The effectiveness of the approach is evaluated, even with three-dimensional data, by means of numerical simulations involving an accurate model of the human head.",

      "abstract": "The importance of robust audio speech processing has rapidly increased in the latest years, as the number of smart and connected devices is growing. This effect is strongly related to the Internet of things framework, introducing concepts such as connected vehicles and future smart cities. Context-Aware applications are fundamental in this evolving environment, enabling smart and custom-Tailored services for a variety of users. The use of on-board speaker recognition (SR) systems can play a key role in enhancing the customization of in-vehicle applications, by identifying the actual users and personalizing services based on their identity. Driven by this motivation, in this paper we present a performance study of an SR system, designed to face typical challenging conditions of an in-vehicle environment. We propose the design of a robust speaker identification algorithm embedding a smart preprocessing method based on voice activity detection, which can effectively reduce the influence of noise and distance on classification. Results show that our solution is able to efficiently improve the correct classification rate, even in the case of distant audio acquisition and in a variety of noisy environments.",

      "abstract": "A conjugate-gradient-based regularization technique in P Banach spaces, in conjunction with an inexact-Newton solving scheme, is presented in this paper. The proposed method is applied to obtain the reconstruction of the dielectric properties of human tissues in hemorrhagic brain stroke microwave imaging. The dielectric reconstruction is obtained by solving a nonlinear inverse problem, starting from a set of scattered-field measurements. The presented numerical simulations with 2-D and 3-D anatomically realistic phantoms, as well as the preliminary experimental results, show that this method can be useful for retrieving the dielectric properties of the human head with a reduced over-smoothing effect in the final images.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, Location Based Services (LBS) are fore- seen as a fundamental building block of modern mobile applications and services. Important examples of LBS concerns indoor environments in which GPS technology cannot be used. On the other hand, the great diffusion of pervasive Mobile Devices (MDs) as smartphones and tablets has enabled many positioning techniques, such as WiFi FingerPrinting (FP), that exploits all the MD's embedded sensors. This paper proposes and investigates the performance of a method exploiting a WiFi FP algorithm for indoor localization fed with information from the barometer to estimate the floor in which the MD is located. Our results, carried out in indoor areas at the University of Genoa (UniGE) and at the University of Bologna (UniBO), show that when more than 5 Access Points (APs) are used the proposed 3D positioning system is able to accurately localize the user with an error below 2 and 1.2 and meters for the UniBO and UniGE case, respectively.",

      "abstract": "Indoor positioning systems have gained a lot of attention in the last few years. With the introduction of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, the knowledge of user's location has become crucial information to deliver the efficient and tailored Location Based Services (LBS), especially in indoor environments. In this paper we propose an AP (Access Point)-centred indoor positioning system that overcomes common limitations presented in conventional positioning systems, such as an excessive involvement of Mobile Devices (MDs). Our work merges ideas originally proposed in [1] and [2] to build an efficient, accurate and smart Probabilistic-FingerPrint (P-FP) algorithm that avoids the MD involvement and considers the signal strength measurements as a random variable in the positioning process. Numerical results, obtained in a real-world deployment, show better performance on positioning accuracy, energy consumption and latency with respect to the MD-based architecture.",

We present the IoT as the key I4.0 technology since it enables faster and more efficient production and management processes, leveraging the flexibility of smart, ubiquitous, connected devices. In particular, we discuss the role of the I4.0 revolution in driving the diffusion of smart products and services, by focusing on ambient intelligence and context awareness in IoT and on the so-called DIKW hierarchy. Finally, to demonstrate the practical impact of this emerging framework, we show, as practical examples, three typical I4.0 applications in the smart factory, smart home, and smart health scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Mobile satellite services are extremely important when continuity of service is requested while the user is moving over a wide area. A notable example is represented by live TV services, or more in general by the Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Services (MBMSs) and its evolved version enhanced MBMS. In this paper, we present the combined use of multicast resource allocation schemes based on subgrouping and application layer joint coding to enhance the performance of live video streaming in mobile satellite systems. The reference architecture foresees a satellite-based long term evolution transmission using orthogonal frequency division multiple access in the forward link. The results show that the combined use of multicast subgrouping resource allocation and application layer joint coding allows high-throughput transmissions with satisfactory user quality of experience of the received video over different satellite channel propagation environments.",

      "abstract": "Amateur drones are enjoying great popularity in recent years due to the wide commercial diffusion of small, rather low-cost devices. More and more user-friendly, easy-to-pilot aerial and terrestrial drones are available off the shelf, and people can even remotely pilot them using their smartphones. This situation brings up the problem of keeping unauthorized drones away from private or sensitive areas, where they can represent a personal or public threat. With this motivation, after a survey of the existing solutions, we propose a WiFi-based approach aimed at detecting nearby aerial or terrestrial devices by performing statistical fingerprint analysis on wireless traffic. This novel detection technique, tested in a variety of real-life scenarios, proved able to efficiently detect and identify intruder drones in all the considered experimental setups, making it a promising unmanned aerial vehicle detection approach in the framework of amateur drone surveillance.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, a numerical study devoted to evaluate the application of a microwave imaging method for brain stroke detection is described. First of all, suitable operating conditions for the imaging system are defined by solving the forward electromagnetic scattering problem with respect to simplified configurations and analyzing the interactions between an illuminating electromagnetic wave at microwave frequencies and the biological tissues inside the head. Then, preliminary inversion results are obtained by applying an imaging procedure based on an iterative Gauss-Newton scheme to a realistic model of the human head. The proposed imaging algorithm is able to deal with the nonlinear and ill-posed problem associated to the integral equations describing the inverse scattering problem. The aim of the inversion procedure is related to the determination of the presence of a hemorrhagic brain stroke by retrieving the distributions of the dielectric parameters of the human tissues inside a slice of the head model.",

      "abstract": "The increasing popularity of low-cost aerial vehicles that can be remotely piloted by amateurs, is giving rise to a number of issues related to public safety and privacy. At the same time, the need for surveillance methods able to detect the presence of unauthorized drones meets the ubiquitous connectivity and pervasive technology typical of the big data era. This dualism drives the research community towards the design of monitoring systems able to integrate machine learning methods and data mining techniques in this evolving environment. In this framework, we consider a WiFi based approach aimed at detecting nearby unmanned aerial vehicles, by performing statistical fingerprint analysis on wireless traffic. We study the inherent vulnerabilities of the considered method through real-life experimental tests by setting up specific attack scenarios, and we devise and test a solution in order to improve the efficiency of the proposed technique in the presence of malicious countermeasures. Results show that the proposed improved detection technique is indeed robust to stealth attacks, and it is able to achieve very good recognition performance in different real-life testing scenarios.",

First, a Gaussian Process (GP) is used during the training (offline) phase of an indoor positioning algorithm to generate the fingerprint database, reducing the expensive labor of acquiring and maintaining the fingerprint database significantly. Furthermore, during the positioning (online) phase, a Smart algorithm (already proposed in [1]) is used for reducing the computation effort for positioning calculation. We call our idea Smart<sup>2</sup> since it enhances the advantages of the base Smart approach. Specifically, Smart<sup>2</sup> reduces the labor during the offline phase by trading it with a small positioning error and, at the same time, it limits the energy consumption in the online phase without incurring in any additional accuracy detriment.",

      "abstract": "Rehabilitation and elderly monitoring for active aging can benefit from Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities in particular for in-home treatments. In this paper, we consider two functions useful for such treatments: 1) activity recognition (AR) and 2) movement recognition (MR). The former is aimed at detecting if a patient is idle, still, walking, running, going up/down the stairs, or cycling; the latter individuates specific movements often required for physical rehabilitation, such as arm circles, arm presses, arm twist, curls, seaweed, and shoulder rolls. Smartphones are the reference platforms being equipped with an accelerometer sensor and elements of the IoT. The work surveys and compares accelerometer signals classification methods to enable IoT for the aforementioned functions. The considered methods are support vector machines (SVMs), decision trees, and dynamic time warping. A comparison of the methods has been proposed to highlight their performance: all the techniques have good recognition accuracies and, among them, the SVM-based approaches show an accuracy above 90% in the case of AR and above 99% in the case of MR.",

      "abstract": "The exponential increase in the number and types of mobile devices, along with their ever-growing sets of capabilities, have enabled the development of new architectures that aim to harness such heterogeneity. Transient clouds are examples of mobile clouds, which are created on-the-fly by the devices present in an environment to share their physical resources (e.g. CPU, memory and network) and would disappear as the nodes leave the network. They enable a device to go beyond its own physical limitations through utilising the capabilities offered by nearby devices over an ad hoc network. This idea exploits the device-to-device (D2D) communications paradigm, which allows two nearby devices to communicate with each other in the licenced cellular bandwidth without a base station involved. In this paper, we present a transient context-aware cloud (TCAC) paradigm based on the assumption that the nodes of the network care more about providing/learning higher level functionalities rather than lower level capabilities in D2D scenario. The proposed architecture, realised by using a WiFi Direct, can be portable through any paradigm, which exploits the D2D communications, so opening the doors to forthcoming 5G scenarios. We present a prototype implementation of our architecture over Android smartphones connected via WiFi Direct along with the performance metrics (power/energy consumption and accuracy) to show the benefits of TCAC. A theoretical and analytical model for the energy consumption related to a device within the TCAC is provided as well. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

      "abstract": "The treatments for brain stroke are strongly timedependent. The medical literature highlights the need of a quick diagnosis in order to guarantee the most effective therapy. An important target for strokes is trying to achieve a Door-to-Needle (DTN) time of less than 60 minutes, which is called Golden Hour [1]. This paper proposes a mobile Smart Helmet (SH) thought to be worn by a patient when the first aid medical team arrives and the aim is to efficiently recognize and detect a brain stroke, on site. While similar solutions in the literature employ the (usually computationally heavy) electromagnetic field inversion problem and image analysis, the proposal of this paper is an NN-based SH. It uses signal analysis to recognize the presence of a stroke with a limited computational burden. In the reported preliminary experiments, carried out via simulations, we have employed a MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) model that implements a 4-layer NN. Numerical results show that proposed signal analysis, applied to a single brain model, is able to efficiently detect the stroke presence with an accuracy around 90%.",

      "abstract": "Indoor navigation and localization are becoming fundamental services nowadays. WiFi-based solutions such as FingerPrinting (FP) are the most widely adopted techniques for positioning and provide better results if compared to other approaches. They require to compare WiFi Received Signal Strength (RSS) with an pre-computed radio map called fingerprint. The recently proposed Smart Probabilistic FingerPrinting (P-FP) algorithm reduces the computational complexity of the traditional FP approach without any accuracy detriment. On the other hand, fog computing has emerged as a new promising paradigm in the recent years, which extends traditional mobile cloud computing capabilities towards the edge of the network and enables location-Aware services. In this paper we propose to offload Smart P-FP computation over a fog platform exploiting a novel distributed algorithm. Performance evaluation validates the effectiveness of the proposed approach with the analysis of: i) the amount of power saved and ii) the efficiency of candidate selection process for offloading. Having 2 or more devices in the vicinity contributing to the computation makes offloading beneficial from a power standpoint. The offloading effectiveness increases with the number of devices willing to contribute and the amount of data to be transferred. Power savings can be as high as 80% if compared with local computation.",

      "abstract": "Recently the problem of interconnecting Internet of Things nodes when they are dispersed over wide geographical areas has been highlighted: This is the Internet of Remote Things (IoRT). It could be able to play a key role in disaster recovery scenarios (e.g., earthquakes, flash floods, terrorist attacks, etc.), where the presence of a communication infrastructure enabling video transmissions from the emergency areas is crucial. Local communications can be provided by incident area networks, while satellite communication systems can bridge the gap toward external networks. In this context, we propose a cooperative resource allocation mechanism, which exploits feedback from links conditions and knowledge of the adaptive coding, allowing a higher quality and more fair experience for all nodes of the IoRT transmitting videos. We implemented each element of the mentioned scenario over an emulation platform to prove the concept and show the obtained benefits.",

Preliminary numerical results concerning the reconstruction of a simulated stroke inside a two-dimensional slice of the human head are reported.

The comparison between Traditional (without any p(o|l) acceleration) and Smart P-FP is performed over different smartphones. The saved energy is about 90% for a large number of Access Points (APs) but is significant even with few APs: more than 86% with 3 APs.

The platform helps physicians to monitor the patients remotely so avoiding hospitalization therapies that can be stressful. In more detail, the work is focused on the Movement Recognition (MR) functionality of the aforementioned platform. It compares algorithms, which process the signal provided by the embedded accelerometer sensor of the smartphone, able to recognize if a patient had performed the movements requested by the physicians. The provided performance comparison of different MR techniques shows that Support Vector Machine-based approaches have very good accuracy (up to 99.3%), thus making the in-home physical therapy reliable.",

      "abstract": "This paper tackles the classical problem of transmission rate allocation in satellite networks where fading may negatively impact communications. Within the framework of multiobjective programming (MOP), this paper introduces a transmission rate allocation criterion among Earth stations (ESs) called L<inf>p</inf>-problem-based rate allocation (L<inf>p</inf>RA). The allocations provided by L<inf>p</inf>RA are representative of a compromise among the need of different performance metrics such as packet loss and transmission power (TP). This paper determines the condition for the existence and the value of a L<inf>p</inf>RA transmission rate allocation bound R to which the transmission rate globally allocated by L<inf>p</inf> RA converges when the overall available transmission rate R mathrm <inf>TOT</inf> tends to infinity. The performance analysis, which is carried out through simulations under different satellite channel conditions, is aimed at investigating L<inf>p</inf>RA features, at showing the existence of the rate bound and the advantages concerning the rate allocation given by using L<inf>p</inf>RA, and at comparing L<inf>p</inf>RA with two other schemes in the literature concerning allocated rate, packet loss rate, transmit power, and execution time.",

      "abstract": "Multimedia content delivery over satellite systems is considered as a promising service in emerging 5G networks. The aim of this paper is to design a novel radio resource management algorithm for efficiently managing multicast multimedia content transmission over satellite network. The proposed approach performs the spectrum management on a per-group basis, by splitting multicast terminals into different subgroups according to the experienced channel qualities. We demonstrate that subgrouping policy defined by the authors as multicast subgrouping-maximum satisfaction index (MS-MSI), based on a new metric (i.e., MSI), overcomes the weakness of the previous techniques proposed in the literature and provides the best tradeoff between user throughput and fairness. As a further result, we demonstrate that MS-MSI is robust to the long propagation delay of satellite links. An extensive simulation campaign has been conducted by considering several satellite environments.",

      "abstract": "This paper focuses on the use of satellite communication systems for the support of Internet of Things (IoT). We refer to the IoT paradigm as the means to collect data from sensors or RFID and to send control messages to actuators. In many application scenarios, sensors and actuators are distributed over a very wide area; in some cases, they are located in remote areas where they are not served by terrestrial access networks and, as a consequence, the use of satellite communication systems becomes of paramount importance for the Internet of Remote Things (IoRT). The enabling factors of IoRT through satellite are: 1) the interoperability between satellite systems and sensors/actuators and 2) the support of IPv6 over satellite. Furthermore, radio resource management algorithms are required to enhance the efficiency of IoT over satellite. In this work, we provide an integrated view of satellite-based IoT, handling this topic as a jigsaw puzzle where the pieces to be assembled are represented by the following topics: MAC protocols for satellite routed sensor networks, efficient IPv6 support, heterogeneous networks interoperability, quality of service (QoS) management, and group-based communications.",

In this paper, a speaker recognition system for MDs based on a multiple-observations approach is presented.

      "abstract": "This paper focuses on countering data hiding in images. Specifically, we refer to the active warden problem, a process which aims at disrupting the covert communications that are possibly taking place within host media. Although this has been extensively studied in the literature, typical state of the art approaches treat the hidden message as a noise-like component, proposing de- noising techniques, lossy compression or noise addition as a countermeasure. In this paper we present novel approach called Lesser Components Distortion (LCD) that aims at disrupting the covert communication while minimizing distortion on the host medium. Although stemming from insights gained from notable works in the spread spectrum steganography field, we prove through extensive testing that it shows remarkable effectiveness against steganographic techniques in general, compared to common attacks.",

Heuristic-ALJC includes also a simple acknowledgement based adaptation of the transmission rate and acts on the basis of feedback information about the overall network status estimated in terms of maximum allowable network throughput and link quality (lossiness). Heuristic-ALJC is implemented through two smartphone Apps (transmitter and receiver) and is suitable to be employed to transmit video streams over networks based on time varying and possibly lossy channels.

      "abstract": "Context information is fundamental for mobile application. A system able to detect Indoor/Outdoor state switching can give useful information to upper-level applications permitting to improve their performance or reduce the computational load and consequently the lifetime of the smartphone. A localization application may exploit the Indoor/Outdoor information to smartly decide if using GPS (that performs well outdoors but poorly indoors) or other localization methods. In this paper we present an ultrasonic-signal-based Indoor/Outdoor detector for smartphones. The phone plays an ultrasonic ping by using its in-built speakers and records the echoes by using its microphone, therefore, no specific hardware is required to be added to the smartphone. The proposed detector shows good performance in terms of accuracy and latency.",

Such application, developed by the authors, has three main functions: i) Gender Recognition (GR), ii) Speaker Recognition (SR) and iii) Language Recognition (LR). All these recognition functions are performed simultaneously by using unsupervised Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. An innovative point of this paper lies in the automatic re-training of the employed SVMs which are able to dynamically update themselves when a (new) audio from a (new) speaker is provided. This allow to build more robust classifiers, which results in better recognition performances. In terms of accuracy, the GR reaches about 98% of correct classifications, SR performs around 80% while LR shows an accuracy of about 74%.",

Unfortunately, satellite channels may be affected by attenuation and fading, causing significant and frequent variations of the link quality. For this reason, static compression, coding and resource allocation are not optimal solutions to guarantee a satisfactory level of Quality of Experience: we propose to apply two techniques: i) a dynamic transmission rate allocation able to assign resources to the links according to their conditions; ii) an application layer joint coder for video transmission capable of adaptively compressing and protecting the transmitted video frames so recovering losses.

HySEP is divided into three parts connected each others: the emulated core network; the simulated wireless access network communicating with the core network; and the real remote host. The overall platform is able to handle real traffic flows and overcomes the limitations introduced by other network simulators.

      "abstract": "Heart failure is a chronic disease that alternates intense and weak phases and requires repeated and frequent hospital treatments. The use of automatic instruments for a remote and ubiquitous monitoring of biological parameters relevant to heart failure pathophysiology offers new perspectives to improve the patients' quality of life and the efficacy of the treatment. The platform described in this paper represents an implementation of an automatic remote monitoring tool where smartphones play a crucial role. They are not employed just to communicate through traditional client-server applications and they are not only the hub of information sent by sensors, but they also act as intelligent processors and autonomous sensors of the patients' motion through a high-accuracy activity recognition algorithm. The proposed platform combines the evolution of health systems and the consequent needs of modern telemedicine with the current context-aware capability of recent smartphones, obtained by implementing specific algorithmic solutions, and with the anything, anytime, and anywhere communication capability of the pervasive communications paradigm. Performance evaluation focuses on the accuracy of the activity recognition estimation, on its applicability to real life, and on the data exchange between smartphones and medical server, allowing to envisage the potential of the designed platform.",

The former composes the Simulated Network Segment (SNS), the latter the Emulated Network Segment (ENS). The use of ns-3 assures a detailed LTE simulative model and an effective mechanism to connect the simulated scenario with real network nodes and links. Moreover, this platform enables the creation of a heterogeneous network through the exploitation of personal computers and free software without using any ad-hoc hardware. HySEP makes possible testing different network configurations, limiting costs and using technologies such as LTE whose real implementation is hardly applicable inside a research laboratory. The tool can be completely configured and used remotely through Internet connections.",

      "abstract": "The exponential increase in the number and types of mobile devices, along with their ever-growing sets of capabilities, have enabled the development of new architectures that aim to harness such heterogeneity. Transient Clouds (TCs) are examples of mobile clouds which are created on-the-fly by the devices present in an environment to share their physical resources (e.g., CPU, memory, network) and would disappear as the nodes leave the network. They enable a device to go beyond its own physical limitations through utilizing the capabilities offered by nearby devices over an ad-hoc network. In this paper we present a Transient Context-Aware Cloud (TCAC) in which the nodes of the network care more about providing/learning higher level functionalities rather than lower level capabilities. We make the case for such an architecture in scenarios where it is not feasible for all the nodes to compute the context due to privacy, energy, and delay constraints rather than an unreachable network.We present a prototype implementation of our architecture over Android smartphones connected via WiFi along with the performance metrics (power/energy consumption and accuracy)to show the benefits of context awareness in TCs.",

      "abstract": "Recently, patients suffering from a set of physical and mental limitations, called co-morbidities, are often treated at home. In this environment, modern communication systems represent a great support to implement Ambient Assisted Living platforms aimed at monitoring patients at home because they enable the seamless integration of heterogeneous sensing units, medical devices, and ubiquitous access to data. This article describes a specific smartphone-centric architecture where smartphones are employed not only as hubs of the health information but also as sensing, processing, and transmitting devices. Smartphones have both short-range (Bluetooth and WiFi employed for local information exchange) and long-range (GPRS, 3G/4G, and WiFi employed as Internet access) communication capabilities; information processing capabilities offered by modern platforms often equipped with different CPUs and with flexible and efficient software; and sensing capabilities implemented through sensors embedded into smartphones such as GPS receivers, accelerometers, microphones, and radio interfaces or through external sensors added to smartphones by cables or connected through local radio interfaces. The specific case of co-morbidities considered in this article implies the necessity to acquire a heterogeneous set of data from patients and from their environment. For this reason this article highlights the information processing capabilities of the introduced smartphone-centric platform. Audio, localization, and movement information processing have been evidenced as well as the specific implementations of these capabilities and their performance.",

      "abstract": "Recently, people have been interested in sharing what they are watching on TV, allowing the development of Social TV Applications often based on mobile devices. In this context, this paper proposes IRTR (Improved Real-Time TV-channel Recognition): a new method aimed at recognizing in real time (live) what people are watching on TV without any active user interaction. IRTR uses the audio signal of the TV program recorded by smartphones and is performed through two steps: i) fingerprint extraction and ii) TV channel real-time identification. Step i) is based on the computation of the Audio Fingerprint (AF). The AF computation has been taken from the literature and has been improved in terms of power consumption and computation speed to make the smartphone implementation feasible by using an ad hoc cost function aimed at selecting the best set of AF parameters. Step ii) is aimed at deciding the TV channel the user is watching. This step is performed using a likelihood estimation algorithm proposed in this paper. The consumed power, computation and response time, and correct decision rate of IRTR, evaluated through experimental measures, show very satisfying results such as a correct decision rate of about 95%, about 2 s of computation time, and above 90% power saving with respect to the literature.",

      "abstract": "Often copyrighted multimedia files are uploaded and shared online. To avoid the unregulated spread of such material many copy detectors have been developed in order to deny the possibility to upload, and consequently make available, copies of copyrighted contents. A widely referenced fingerprint method for content-based audio identification is the Philips Robust Hash (PRH). This paper introduces a simple but effective attack technique capable to defeat a PRH fingerprint-based audio copy detector without significantly affecting the signal quality. It is a heuristic method that adds a suitable distortion to the original audio signal, so that the modified signal is not detected as a copy of the original one but is perceptively very similar to it. The quality of the modified signal has been evaluated in terms of a distortion measure based on a mathematical model of the human auditory system and of the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). The attack method has shown a promising success rate.",

      "abstract": "Assuring a satisfactory level of Quality of Experience (QoE) to users is nowadays an important challenge for network service providers. At the same time, power consumption minimization is another important issue for network management. Consequently, the ideal goal is to maximize the QoE and, meanwhile, to minimize the power transmitted by network nodes. In telecommunications networks QoE is often linked to the transmission rate assured to a given application. Actually higher guaranteed transmission rate, lower packet loss, delay and jitter, which have a direct impact on QoE. In this view the requirement of maximizing QoE and minimizing power consumption conflict with each other because higher is the transmit rate better the QoE but higher required transmitted power. By taking the session time of a web navigation as a reference metric, in this paper, the authors propose a transmission rate allocation algorithm for satellite networks aimed at finding a satisfactory compromise between QoE and Transmitted Power (TP). Earth stations communicate with a satellite by using a common channel with an overall available transmission rate of R<inf>TOT</inf>. The allocation algorithm is formulated starting from the Multi Objective Programming theory and the L<inf>p</inf>-problem and it is called L<inf>p</inf>-problem based Rate Allocation (L<inf>p</inf>RA). Numerical results show that L<inf>p</inf>RA assures satisfying operative compromise between QoE improvement and power saving.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY Delay-Tolerant/Disruption-Tolerant Networking (DTN) architecture will be used in future deep space missions, to enable autonomous networking operations and disruption-tolerant data communications. Therefore, it is worth analyzing the performance of the DTN Bundle Protocol (BP) in a realistic deep space environment, reproducing the characteristics of Mars missions. After a comprehensive introduction on data communications between Mars and Earth, the paper presents the essential features of both the BP DTN architecture and the Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP), adopted here as BP convergence layer on deep space links, thanks to its ability to cope with the very long delays typical of this environment. The focus of our experiments is on analysis of the bundle flow from a Mars lander to an Earth control center through an intermediate relay node, for which two configurations are considered, inspired to Odyssey and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter missions, respectively. Results are obtained by means of a test bed consisting of some GNU/Linux personal computers running either Interplanetary Overlay Network (ION) or DTN2 BP implementations. The analysis of results aims to highlight the role played by BP and LTP in tackling the challenges of Mars to Earth communications. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. The paper focuses on the experimental validation of the Delay Tolerant Network (DTN)/Bundle Protocol architecture, for which, a dedicated testbed has been developed. The presented study revisits the cases of ongoing Odyssey and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter scientific missions consisting in data transfer from Mars to Earth. The conducted performance assessment confirms the added value of Bundle Protocol and Licklider Transmission Protocol in enabling automatic data transfer over long distance even in the presence of very large latency and link intermittencies.

      "abstract": "Indoor localization of targets by using electromagnetic waves has attracted a lot of attention in the last few years. Thanks to the wide availability of electromagnetic sources deployed for various applications (e.g., WiFi), nowadays it is possible to perform this task by using low-cost mobile devices, such as smartphones. To this end, in order to achieve high positioning accuracy and reduce the computational resources used in the position estimation, fingerprinting approaches are usually employed. However, in this case, a time-consuming training phase, where a great number of measurements must be performed, is needed. In this letter, a novel approach, where the training data are obtained by means of finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations of the electromagnetic propagation in the considered scenario, is presented. The performances of the method are assessed by means of experimental results in a real scenario. © 2002-2011 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Telemedicine applications provide healthcare services through communications technologies overcoming the geographical separation between patients and caregivers. These services can be provided via wireless devices, such as smart-phones with dedicated applications. An interesting application concerns the so-called situation awareness algorithms and, in particular, the Activity Recognition (AR) aimed at tracking the physical activity (or movements) of patients that need a constant monitoring of their medical conditions. This work takes as reference an architecture applicable, but not limited to, patients suffering from Heart Failure (HF) and presents a performance comparison between AR approaches based on the accelerometer signal captured through the patients' smartphones. In more detail, the considered AR techniques apply two different classifiers used to decide the patients movements: a J48 decision tree and a Support Vector Machine (SVM). For each classifier, three different features sets, characterizing the accelerometer signal, have been employed. The performance are evaluated both in terms of accuracy-related metrics and time needed by each classifiers to perform the decision. The results show that SVM provides the best accuracy while the J48 requires less classification time.",

      "abstract": "The Vertical Handover and the related Network Selection process play a fundamental role in supporting reliable communications over MANETs. The goal of the Network Selection is to determine the Radio Access Network (RAN) that a Mobile Node (MN) has to use among several available RANs. This decision process finds out the RAN that fits the MN requirements and has to provide the decision as rapidly as possible. A computationally heavy Network Selection algorithm can impact the whole handover process because it waits until the selection is carried out. This waste of time can have negative consequences in the quality of communications. The main contribution of this paper is the definition of a new Network Selection algorithm based on a different formulation of the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method found in the literature, called Dynamic-TOPSIS (D-TOPSIS). It is aimed at performing the same selection of the TOPSIS but with a significant reduction of necessary computational load. Finally, the numerical results highlight the execution time reduction obtained by applying the D-TOPSIS with respect to the standard algorithm, and other Network Selection techniques usually applied within Vertical Handover Processes. © 2014 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The deployment of terrestrial/satellite networks, plays a crucial role for for risk and emergency management. In this context, efficient solutions for heterogeneous and mobile networks, including satellite portions that allows wide coverages, represents a key issue. In the mentioned scenario, transmitting video with portable devices (such as smartphone), over terrestrial/satellite networks, to a Remote Monitoring Host (RMH) may support emergency and rescue operations after crisis situations. Unfortunately heterogeneity often implies impairments such as packet losses, due to errors and congestion, which negatively affect the video quality. We present an application layer joint coding algorithm for video transmission, that adaptively applies video compression and channel coding at the application layer, on the basis of the overall network condition estimated in terms of maximum allowable throughput of the network and quality (packet cancellations or lossiness). A deep performance investigation, carried out with real implementation of the algorithm, compares the joint coding against fixed schemes and shows that the joint approach adapt the video transmission to terrestrial/satellite emergency networks so allowing a more efficient resource exploitation. © 2014 IEEE.",

Meanwhile these networks require complex control techniques to assure Quality of Service (QoS) to users. Before implementing such networks, a deep performance analysis, through the use of network simulators or real models, is necessary. In particular the first ones (e.g. Network Simulator 3 - ns-3 among the others) are quite simple and easy to manage and configure, while the second ones assure the handling of real traffic flows.

      "abstract": "Some definitions of bandwidth fairness are discussed with the aim of allowing a full comprehension of its meaning and a possible use for the performance evaluation of bandwidth allocation algorithms. A particular bandwidth allocation may be considered fair or unfair not only on the basis of the amount of provided bandwidth and of the channel status, but also dependently on the use of the bandwidth and of the possible user/network revenue. The analysis has shown that the fairness concept has different meanings and, consequently, must be measured through different indexes. Allocation algorithms may be fair concerning one index and unfair concerning another one. The MMF (max min fairness) and Jain fairness indexes' results are in agreement concerning the order when the fading factor varies and the bandwidth is fixed but the slopes of the curves provided by the two indexes are different, also from the concavity viewpoint, and IJF increases and decreases less quickly by varying bandwidth.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes a system that allows recognizing a person's emotional state starting from audio signal registrations. The provided solution is aimed at improving the interaction among humans and computers, thus allowing effective human-computer intelligent interaction. The system is able to recognize six emotions (anger, boredom, disgust, fear, happiness, and sadness) and the neutral state. This set of emotional states is widely used for emotion recognition purposes. It also distinguishes a single emotion versus all the other possible ones, as proven in the proposed numerical results. The system is composed of two subsystems: 1) gender recognition (GR) and 2) emotion recognition (ER). The experimental analysis shows the performance in terms of accuracy of the proposed ER system. The results highlight that the a priori knowledge of the speaker's gender allows a performance increase. The obtained results show also that the features selection adoption assures a satisfying recognition rate and allows reducing the employed features. Future developments of the proposed solution may include the implementation of this system over mobile devices such as smartphones.",

      "abstract": "Human-machine interaction is performed by devices such as the keyboard, the touch-screen, or speechto- text applications. For example, a speech-to-text application is software that allows the device to translate the spoken words into text. These tools translate explicit messages but ignore implicit messages, such as the emotional status of the speaker, filtering out a portion of information available in the interaction process. This chapter focuses on emotion detection. An emotion-aware device can also interact more personally with its owner and react appropriately according to the user's mood, making the user-machine interaction less stressful. The chapter gives the guidelines for building emotion-aware smartphone applications in an opportunistic way (i.e., without the user's collaboration). In general, smartphone applications might be employed in different contexts; therefore, the to-be-detected emotions might be different.",

The work aims at highlighting the positioning accuracy, the robustness and the consistency of the method by testing it over two different smartphone platforms (i.e., Nokia N95 and Samsung Galaxy S II), within a given area. In more detail, three different variants of the probabilistic approach have been tested: Nearest Neighbor (NN), K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) and K Weighted-Nearest Neighbor (KW-NN). Numerical experiments, carried out in an area of around 80 [m<sup>2</sup>], have shown that the probabilistic fingerprint provides good position accuracy (less than 1.20 [m] of error) for both devices and also robustness when the signal strength acquisitions are reduced. Finally, the similarity of results provided by the two smartphones leads to assert that the probabilistic approach is also consistent with respect to the device employed in the experiments. © 2013 Society for Modeling & Simulation International.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes a new location recognition algorithm for automatic check-in applications (LRACI), suited to be implemented within Smartphones, integrated in the Cloud platform and representing a service for Cloud end users. The algorithm, the performance of which is independent of the employed device, uses both global and hybrid positioning systems (GPS/HPS) and, in an opportunistic way, the presence of Wi-Fi access points (APs), through a new definition of Wi-Fi FingerPrint (FP), which is proposed in this paper. This FP definition considers the order relation among the received signal strength (RSS) rather than the absolute values. This is one of the main contributions of this paper. LRACI is designed to be employed where traditional approaches, usually based only on GPS/HPS, fail, and is aimed at finding user location, with a room-level resolution, in order to estimate the overall time spent in the location, called Permanence, instead of the simple presence. LRACI allows automatic check-in in a given location only if the users' Permanence is larger than a minimum amount of time, called Stay Length (SL), and may be exploited in the Cloud. For example, if many people check-in in a particular location (e.g., a supermarket or a post office), it means that the location is crowded. Using LRACI-based data, collected by smartphones in the Cloud and made available in the Cloud itself, end users can manage their daily activities (e.g., buying food or paying a bill) in a more efficient way. The proposal, practically implemented over Android operating system-based Smartphones, has been extensively tested. Experimental results have shown a location recognition accuracy of about 90%, opening the door to real LRACI employments. In this sense, a preliminary study of its application in the Cloud, obtained through simulation, has been provided to highlight the advantages of the LRACI features. © 1999-2012 IEEE.",

The work proposes a simple algebraic approach aimed at reducing the computational and energy loads of the probabilistic fingerprinting, which is employed to carry out the position of a smartphone on the basis of the captured WiFi Access Points signal strengths in an indoor area. The presented solution does not apply any kind of approximation with respect to the traditional approach, so avoiding accuracy detriment. The idea is to factoring out the parts of the probabilistic fingerprint formulae that can be computed a-priori, so reducing the computational burden of the positioning process. The paper also highlights the effectiveness of the proposed solution by evaluating the energy saved in comparison with the traditional approach. The obtained results, collected by testing three different smartphones, show that our approach allows saving a significant quantity of energy so increasing the smartphones battery lifetime.",

      "abstract": "The paper deals with the classical problem of the resource allocation in geostationary satellite scenarios where fading may negatively impact the communications. In more detail, we consider the case in which different performance metrics, such as Packet Loss and Power, are simultaneously taken into account. Starting from the wide literature in the field, this work tries to categorize the available and well-known resource allocation approaches into three groups: i) the capacity maximization with constrained power group, ii) the power minimization with constrained capacity group and iii) the multi-objective programming group. For each group a general mathematical formulation has been proposed and the main differences among the groups have been highlighted. The performance of the three listed groups are compared through simulations where two Earth Stations, afflicted by different fading conditions, have been considered. The comparison takes into account all the mentioned metrics (i.e., loss and power) and the computational complexity of the allocation approaches. © 2013 IEEE.",

The main contribution of the work is a method employing a novel windowing technique which reduces the rate of accelerometer readings while maintaining high recognition accuracy by combining two single-classification weighting policies. The proposed method has been implemented on Android OS smartphones and experimental tests have produced satisfying results. It represents a useful solution in the aforementioned health remote applications such as the Heart Failure (HF) patients monitoring mentioned below.",

      "abstract": "The problem of bandwidth allocation may be simply stated, independently of the target of the allocation: an amount of bandwidth must be shared among different entities. Each entity receives a portion of the overall bandwidth. Bandwidth allocation may be formalized as a Multi-Objective Programming (MOP) problem where the constraint is the maximum available bandwidth. The objectives of the allocation such as loss and power may be modelled through a group of objective functions possibly contrasting with each other. It is quite intuitive that using more bandwidth will reduce losses, but also that transmitted power will increase with the bandwidth. Which is the balance among these needs? This letter proposes an extended model for bandwidth allocation and uses a modified version of a MOP-based bandwidth allocation to provide a possible solution to the mentioned balancing problems. © 2012 IEEE.",

The paper also discusses the existence of a capacity allocation, called Capacity Bound, on which the performance converges independently of the overall capacity available C<inf>TOT</inf>.

Examples of context-aware services are profile changes as a result of context changes, proximity-based advertising or media content tagging, etc. The contribution of this chapter is to propose a survey of several methods to extract context information, by employing a smartphone, based on Digital Signal Processing and Pattern Recognition approaches, aimed at answering to the following questions about the user's surroundings: what, who, where, when, why and how.

      "abstract": "In deep communications systems bandwidth availability, storage and computational capacity play a crucial role and represent precious, as well as limited, communications resources. Starting from this consideration, high efficient image compression coding algorithms may represent a key solution to optimize the resources employment. In this paper two possible approaches have been considered: JPEG2000 and CCSDS Image Compression, which is specifically designed for satellite and deep space communications. In more details, two coders have been compared in terms of performance: JasPer, which is an implementation of the JPEG2000 standards, and the BPE, which is based on the CCSDS recommendations. The proposed comparison takes into account both the quality of the compressed images, by evaluating the Peak Signal to Noise Ratio, and the time needed to compress the images: the Compression Time. The latter parameters, which concerns the computational complexity of the compression algorithm, is very interesting for deep space systems because of their limited computational and energy resources. © 2010 Institute for Computer Sciences, Social-Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.",

      "abstract": "Next-generation Internet infrastructures have two specific macroscopic requirements: ubiquity and quality of service guarantee. Satellite and wireless systems can easily guarantee ubiquity but, due to noise and fading, they may fail matching quality of service requirements. Bandwidth Allocation algorithms are often used to smooth the problem but they must be properly designed, tuned and tested before their employment. It is important to fix guidelines to orienteer the design to have a correct evaluation of the results in line with the objectives. The basic idea is that bandwidth allocation should be fair and efficient, but what does it mean? What is the definition of fairness and efficiency? The answer of this article relies on Fairness and Bandwidth Utilization concepts, which are consolidated in the field, and on the idea of Performance Efficiency, proposed in this article. All of them may be translated in indexes that can be important to evaluate bandwidth allocation algorithms in satellite and wireless environments. This is exactly the aim of this article, which suggests some design and evaluation guidelines for bandwidth allocation schemes based on the mentioned concepts and considers some allocation methodologies proposed in the literature as a reference.",

      "abstract": "This paper considers a packet-based telecommunication network architecture suited to be used as an Environmental Monitoring System (EMS) over wide areas. It can be employed to retrieve the measures of physical quantities, such as temperature, humidity, and vibrations intensity (physical information) together with the geographical position where the measures are taken (position information). The telecommunication network supporting the EMS is composed of: a network of sensors, a group of earth stations called Sinks, a satellite backbone, and a destination. Each sensor collects physical and position information, encapsulates it into packets and conveys it towards the sinks which give access to the satellite backbone that connects the sinks to the destination. A single sensor transmits the information to all sinks but only one sink transmits it over the satellite channel. Even if the redundant transmission of the same data from more than one sink would increase the safety of the system, it would increase also the costs of it. The selection of the sink which forwards the information of a sensor to the destination is important to increase the performance of the EMS. This paper introduces specific performance metrics to evaluate the functionality of the whole EMS in terms of reliability, reactivity, and spent energy. The reference metrics are packet loss rate, average packet delay, and energy consumption. Then the paper presents an algorithm to select the transmitting sink for each sensor, which is aimed at maximizing the performance in terms of the mentioned metrics. The algorithm is tested through simulation. © 2008 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The paper studies the bandwidth allocation process over satellite communication systems as a Multi - Objective Programming (MOP) problem and evaluates an allocation method called \"Combined Utopia Minimum Distance\" (Combined UMD). The entities of the system are earth stations and, for each of them, a set of performance metrics (represented by specific analytical functions), which compete to access the satellite channel. Combined UMD is aimed at approaching the performance obtained for each performance metric when there is no conflict among them to access the channel. In short, it assigns the bandwidth so to approach a non-competitive situation where each metric \"sees\" the overall channel bandwidth availability as close as possible. In more detail, in this work two kinds of performance metric have been considered: the Packet Loss Probability, which is a typical QoS metric for the TCP based traffic and the Average Delay, which is typical for UDP based traffic. The allocation method is tested through the ns2 simulator by using TCP and UDP traffic generators and by varying the fading level of the satellite channel over time. Combined UMD has been compared with other approaches taken from the literature in the field. ©2008 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Resource allocation represents an important issue for the next generation TCP/IP Quality of Service-based satellite networks. Many schemes, proposed in the recent literature, consider Internet traffic as the superposition of traffic sources without distinguishing between User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) flows, even if UDP and TCP imply very different traffic characteristics. The basic idea of this work is that a resource allocation algorithm which is conscious of the difference may be more efficient because it can make use of the different behaviour of TCP and UDP in the presence of network congestion. Actually TCP reduces the source flow rate and, as a consequence, also the bandwidth occupancy when there is network congestion. The use of this feature within the bandwidth allocation scheme allows reducing the bandwidth waste due to over provisioning and using the residual bandwidth for other sources. The advantage is particularly clear over satellite channels where fading often affects the communication: having some residual bandwidth available for stations which have experienced fading can improve the satellite network performance. This paper presents a detailed performance evaluation of a bandwidth allocation scheme, called E-CAP-ABASC and studied for the satellite environment. The bandwidth is assigned to the earth stations that compose the network by a master station on the basis of a cost function whose main part is represented by a closed-form of the packet loss probabilities for the TCP and UDP traffic. The use of two different packet loss probability models for TCP and UDP allows exploiting the different features of the two traffic types, so improving the overall performance either in terms of packet loss or, on the other hand, in terms of the traffic admitted. The performance evaluation is carried out by varying the link degradation due to fading, the traffic load, and the flow balance between UDP and TCP. The results show a good performance of E-CAP-ABASC, compared with two other schemes. Advantages and drawbacks are discussed. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

      "abstract": "Modern environmental monitoring systems are based on Satellite-based Sensor Networks (SSN) where earth stations (Sinks) gather information from sensors and use the satellite channel to send it to remote sites. For the sake of efficiency of a whole monitoring system, the SSN has to be managed by following two main aims: to guarantee the reliability, in particular in case of failure of the satellite portion of the network, and to limit both delay, which is representative of a very important Quality of Service (QoS) metric, and energy consumption. The dynamic sink selection process may allow reaching both aims of the system. In more detail, the paper proposes: the description of the SSN architecture taken as reference, the quality requirements of the system, a revision of the Sink selection method called LINMAP, and an introductive simulative study of its performance in case of failure of the satellite portion of the system. © 2007 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "In the GRID environment investigated in this work, each node of the network can be either a terminal host or a web cache location. Objects, which can represent either a file or any other resource to be shared, are downloaded throughout the network among the nodes. For memory saving and for safety reasons, each object is composed of a number of portions and not all the portions are located within the same node, because no node should have the complete knowledge of each object. It is strongly recommendable because if a single node should be either accessed without authorization, information retrieved is not sufficient to detect the overall content. Concerning networking viewpoint, the following main issues will characterize the performance of object exchange: Position of the information, Strategy to reach the information, Algorithm to download information, Capacity Planning. The paper proposes a control architecture that considers the mentioned issues. The problem is modeled through a mathematical formulation and a specific cost function, which takes into account all the necessary details, is introduced for each controller as well as a minimization procedure.

      "abstract": "The demand of bandwidth for TCP/IP based services is growing significantly and the wireless networks are becoming a frequently employed solution to satisfy it. In the wireless scenario, High Altitude Platform (HAP) communications represent a reality, even if absorption and scattering of radio waves by atmospheric components may affect the performance of the communication system. In particular, rain causes severe attenuation so creating communications detriments. The dynamic bandwidth allocation among earth stations may be part of rain fading countermeasures aimed at improving the level of Quality of Service (QoS). The paper formalizes the bandwidth allocation process as a Multi - Objective Programming (MOP) problem; describes four allocation schemes already in the literature by using the MOP framework and proposes one new algorithm that exploits MOP features: it is called Minimum Distance (MD) algorithm. The allocation strategies described are compared each other to highlight the peculiar characteristics for each of them and to show the performance of MD scheme. The reference metrics are the packet loss probability and the allocated bandwidth. © 2006 IEEE.",

The expressions found, being in closed form, are suited to be used as cost or utility function in bandwidth allocation controls, QoS Routing algorithms and Pricing methods. To get throughput and packet loss probability expressions dependent only on network resources and protocol settings, an analytical approximation of the round trip time is provided and used to get the mentioned formulae. The new expressions introduced depend on the following quantities: bottleneck available bandwidth and buffer length, number of TCP active connections sharing the bottleneck, number of hosts generating the connections, propagation delay and TCP parameters (window reduction factor when a packet is lost and number of packets covered by one acknowledgement). A performance analysis provided through network simulation and emulation is reported.",
