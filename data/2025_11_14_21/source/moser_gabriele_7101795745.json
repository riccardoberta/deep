      "abstract": "The choice of an appropriate Traffic Analysis Zone (TAZ) system is a critical step of travel demand modelling that is often overlooked. Studies have approached this process with the goal of favouring the homogeneity of socio-economic and geographic characteristics of the zones, also possibly taking into account the minimisation of the number of intrazonal trips. However, beyond the application of general guidelines and individual experience to specific case studies, the definition of a formal approach is still an unsolved issue. Nevertheless, the rapid ICT development and the novel big data sources allow to enhance traditional models by exploiting additional land use and spatio-temporal mobility features. This paper proposes a multisource data-driven method to support TAZ definition by identifying, through a clustering approach, zones that are homogeneous from the point of view of activities, network characteristics, and land-cover. To this end, in the proposed approach, satellite remote sensing image segmentation, OpenStreetMap layers, and Floating Car Data (FCD) are jointly exploited to define a TAZ configuration, which can be directly used as a support for planning purposes. The procedure is experimentally validated with a case study associated with the EUR district of the city of Rome, Italy, using satellite Sentinel-2 imagery, the corresponding OpenStreetMap data, and an FCD set containing more than 1.500.000 trips.",

      "abstract": "The climate change of the last decades is causing an increase in the frequency of extreme event occurrences. Numerous studies confirm the link between extreme meteorological events and lightning activity. The possibility of having short-Term predictions of the intensity of lightning phenomena would allow the near-real-Time monitoring of the evolution of these events. Such knowledge would help in defining operational strategies to mitigate effects on the population and the infrastructure. In this context, this article proposes a multidisciplinary approach aiming at developing a regression algorithm to nowcast the density of cloud-To-ground lightning strokes 1 h in advance. The algorithm is developed on the basis of a joint combination of remote sensing data, numerical weather prediction model outcomes, and lightning observations. The possible dependence between the meteorological data and the density of lightning is estimated using Gaussian process regression models. Separate models are created for positive and negative strokes and for strokes occurrences over the land or sea. The experimental results indicate that the model quite accurately estimates low numbers of strokes, whereas larger numbers of strokes are estimated with higher errors. Nevertheless, their presence is correctly detected. This suggests the potential of the method as a processing tool to support the management of weather-related hazards.",

      "abstract": "Unsupervised change detection (CD) stands as a critical tool for damage assessment after a natural disaster. We emphasize heterogeneous CD methods, which support the case of highly heterogeneous images at the two observation dates, providing greater flexibility than traditional homogeneous methods. This adaptability is vital for swift responses in the aftermath of natural disasters. In this framework, we address the challenging case of detecting changes between the hyperspectral and synthetic aperture radar images. This case has intrinsic difficulties, namely, the difference in the nature of the physical quantity measured, added to the great difference in dimensionality of the two imaging domains. To address these challenges, a novel method is proposed based on the integration of a manifold learning technique and deep learning networks trained to perform an image-to-image translation task. The method works in a fully unsupervised manner, further enforcing a fast implementation in real-world scenarios. From an application-oriented perspective, we focus on flooded-area mapping using the PRISMA and COSMO-SkyMed missions. The experimental validation on two datasets, a semisimulated one and a real one associated with flooding, suggests that the proposed method allows for accurate detection of flooded areas and other ground changes.",

      "abstract": "Image classification - or semantic segmentation - from input multiresolution imagery is a demanding task. In particular, when dealing with images of the same scene collected at the same time by very different acquisition systems, for example multispectral sensors onboard satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the difference between the involved spatial resolutions can be very large and multiresolution information fusion is particularly challenging. This work proposes two novel multiresolution fusion approaches, based on deep convolutional networks, Bayesian modeling, and probabilistic graphical models, addressing the challenging case of input imagery with very diverse spatial resolutions. The first method aims to fuse the multimodal multiresolution imagery via a posterior probability decision fusion framework, after computing posteriors on the multiresolution data separately through deep neural networks or decision tree ensembles. The optimization of the parameters of the model is fully automated by also developing an approximate formulation of the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. The second method aims to perform the fusion of the multimodal multiresolution information through a pyramidal tree structure, where the imagery can be inserted, modeled, and analyzed at its native resolutions. The application is to the semantic segmentation of areas affected by wildfires for burnt area mapping and management. The experimental validation is conducted with UAV and satellite data of the area of Marseille, France. The code is available at https://github.com/Ayana-Inria/BAS_UAV_satellite_fusion.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a novel methodology for generating realistic abundance maps from hyperspectral imagery using an unsupervised, deep-learning-driven approach. Our framework integrates blind linear hyperspectral unmixing with state-of-the-art diffusion models to enhance the realism and diversity of synthetic abundance maps. First, we apply blind unmixing to extract endmembers and abundance maps directly from raw hyperspectral data. These abundance maps then serve as inputs to a diffusion model, which acts as a generative engine to synthesize highly realistic spatial distributions. Diffusion models have recently revolutionized image synthesis by offering superior performance, flexibility, and stability, making them well-suited for high-dimensional spectral data. By leveraging this combination of physically interpretable unmixing and deep generative modeling, our approach enables the simulation of hyperspectral sensor outputs under diverse imaging con-ditions-critical for data augmentation, algorithm benchmarking, and model evaluation in hyperspectral analysis. Notably, our method is entirely unsupervised, ensuring adaptability to different datasets without the need for labeled training data. We validate our approach using real hyperspectral imagery from the PRISMA space mission for Earth observation, demonstrating its effectiveness in producing realistic synthetic abundance maps that capture the spatial and spectral characteristics of natural scenes.",

      "abstract": "Hyperspectral (HS) satellite data are of considerable importance for applications such as environmental monitoring and precision agriculture, given the richness of the spectral information they contain. However, HS data typically exhibit limited spatial resolution and are less readily available than multispectral (MS) data. This study, which aims to simulate data with high spectral and spatial resolution, explores the use of attention-based spectral reconstruction (SR) techniques, specifically MST++, MIRNet, AWAN, and Restormer, to derive HS data in the visible near infrared (VNIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) from MS imagery. High-resolution MS and HS image pairs are generated from AVIRIS-NG aerial data and employed for training procedures, thereby enabling the reconstruction of HS data that closely resembles the original measurements. The results indicate that SR techniques can considerably enhance the utility of existing MS datasets for HS-dependent applications. Such techniques can effectively be employed to synthesize high-resolution HS data from MS inputs, thereby facilitating the potential for developing a comprehensive end-to-end sensor simulator. This is particularly advantageous in the context of simulating data from a mission that has not yet become operational, as exemplified by the PRISMA-2G data, which could be simulated, for example, from Sentinel-2 data.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes a supervised method for the joint classification and fusion of multiresolution panchromatic and hyperspectral data based on the combination of probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) and deep learning methods. The idea is to exploit the spatial and spectral information contained in panchromatic and hyperspectral images at different resolutions with the aim to generate a classification map at the spatial resolution of the panchromatic channel, while exploiting the richness of the spectral information provided by the hyperspectral channels. The proposed technique is based on deep learning, with FCN-type architectures, and PGMs, through the definition of a conditional random field (CRF) model approximating the behavior of the ideal fully connected CRF in a computationally tractable manner. The neural architecture aims to integrate hyperspectral and panchromatic data at the corresponding spatial resolution and generate posterior probability estimates, while the CRF incorporates information associated with not only local but also long-distance spatio-spectral relationships. The algorithm has been experimentally validated with PRISMA data from the Italian Space Agency with promising results.",

The algorithm is developed using atmospheric variables retrieved from remote sensing, numerical weather prediction model outcomes and lightning location systems' data. Gaussian Process Regression is used to estimate the possible dependence among the available meteorological variables and the lightning activity. Separate models are created for positive and negative strokes and for strokes over land or sea areas. The performed tests suggest that the proposed model quite accurately estimates low numbers of strokes whereas larger numbers of strokes are estimated with errors, mostly of underestimation. Nonetheless, since the presence of strokes is correctly nowcasted, the detection of their presence may be considered a useful information for activities related to the weather hazard management.",

Two novel multiresolution fusion approaches, based on Bayesian and probabilistic graphical fusion models and integrated with a deep fully convolutional network and with the expectation-maximization algorithm, are proposed. The application is to a real case of fire zone mapping and management in the area of Marseille, France.",

      "abstract": "This article presents a method for the automatic learning of the potentials of a stochastic model, in particular a conditional random field (CRF), in a non-parametric fashion. The proposed model is based on a neural architecture, in order to leverage the modeling capabilities of deep learning (DL) approaches to directly learn semantic and spatial information from the input data. Specifically, the methodology is based on fully convolutional networks and fully connected neural networks. The idea is to access the multiscale information intrinsically extracted in the intermediate layers of a fully convolutional network through the integration of fully connected neural networks at different scales, while favoring the interpretability of the hidden layers as posterior probabilities. The potentials of the CRF are learned through an additional convolutional layer, whose kernel models the local spatial information considered. The loss function is computed as a linear combination of cross-entropy losses, accounting for the multiscale and the spatial information. To evaluate the capabilities of the proposed approach for the semantic segmentation of remote sensing images, the experimental validation was conducted with the ISPRS 2-D semantic labeling challenge Vaihingen and Potsdam datasets and with the IEEE GRSS data fusion contest Zeebruges dataset. As the ground truths of these benchmark datasets are spatially exhaustive, they have been modified to approximate the spatially sparse ground truths common in real remote sensing applications. The results are significant, as the proposed approach obtains higher average classification accuracies than recent state-of-The-Art techniques considered in this article. The code is available at https://github.com/Ayana-Inria/CRFNet-RS.",

      "abstract": "The availability of multimodal remotely sensed images calls for the development of methods capable to jointly exploit the information deriving from images acquired at different spatial resolutions, frequencies, and bands, taking advantage from their possible complementary features. This letter proposes to address this task in the case of multimission synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, through a combination of fully convolutional networks (FCNs), hierarchical probabilistic graphical models (PGMs), and decision tree ensembles. The objective is to model the multimodal information collected at multiple spatial resolutions by distinct space missions with SAR payloads through the nonparametric formulation of FCNs and decision trees, and the spatial and multiresolution modeling capabilities of FCNs and hierarchical PGMs. The experimental validation is conducted with multimission SAR imagery acquired at X-, L-, and C-band, respectively, by COSMO-SkyMed, SAOCOM, and Sentinel-1 over Northern Italy. The results suggest the advantages of incorporating multifrequency radar acquisitions to reach accurate classification maps and the multimodal fusion capabilities of the proposed methodology.",

      "abstract": "Image translation with convolutional autoencoders has recently been used as an approach to multimodal change detection (CD) in bitemporal satellite images. A main challenge is the alignment of the code spaces by reducing the contribution of change pixels to the learning of the translation function. Many existing approaches train the networks by exploiting supervised information of the change areas, which, however, is not always available. We propose to extract relational pixel information captured by domain-specific affinity matrices at the input and use this to enforce alignment of the code spaces and reduce the impact of change pixels on the learning objective. A change prior is derived in an unsupervised fashion from pixel pair affinities that are comparable across domains. To achieve code space alignment, we enforce pixels with similar affinity relations in the input domains to be correlated also in code space. We demonstrate the utility of this procedure in combination with cycle consistency. The proposed approach is compared with the state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning algorithms. Experiments conducted on four real and representative datasets show the effectiveness of our methodology.",

      "abstract": "Image segmentation is the process of partitioning a digital image into a set of homogeneous regions (according to some homogeneity criterion) to facilitate a subsequent higher-level analysis. In this context, the present paper proposes an unsupervised and graph-based method of image segmentation, which is driven by an application goal, namely, the generation of image segments associated with a user-defined and application-specific goal. A graph, together with a random grid of source elements, is defined on top of the input image. From each source satisfying a goal-driven predicate, called seed, a propagation algorithm assigns a cost to each pixel on the basis of similarity and topological connectivity, measuring the degree of association with the reference seed. Then, the set of most significant regions is automatically extracted and used to estimate a statistical model for each region. Finally, the segmentation problem is expressed in a Bayesian framework in terms of probabilistic Markov random field (MRF) graphical modeling. An ad hoc energy function is defined based on parametric models, a seed-specific spatial feature, a background-specific potential, and local-contextual information. This energy function is minimized through graph cuts and, more specifically, the alpha-beta swap algorithm, yielding the final goal-driven segmentation based on the maximum a posteriori (MAP) decision rule. The proposed method does not require deep a priori knowledge (e.g., labelled datasets), as it only requires the choice of a goal-driven predicate and a suited parametric model for the data. In the experimental validation with both magnetic resonance (MR) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, the method demonstrates robustness, versatility, and applicability to different domains, thus allowing for further analyses guided by the generated products.",

      "abstract": "This paper introduces a method to automatically learn the unary and pairwise potentials of a conditional random field (CRF) from the input data in a non-parametric fashion, within the framework of the semantic segmentation of remote sensing images. The proposed model is based on fully convolutional networks (FCNs) and fully connected neural networks (FCNNs) to extensively exploit the semantic and spatial information contained in the input data and in the intermediate layers of an FCN. The idea of the model is twofold: first to learn the statistics of a CRF via a convolutional layer, whose kernel defines the clique of interest, and, second, to favor the interpretability of the intermediate layers as posterior probabilities through the FCNNs. The method was tested with the ISPRS 2D Semantic Labeling Challenge Vaihingen dataset, after modifying the ground truths to approximate the ones found in realistic remote sensing applications, characterized by scarce and spatially non-exhaustive annotations. The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed technique for the semantic segmentation of satellite images.",

      "abstract": "Among the effects of the climate change we are experiencing, the increase in the frequency of extreme event occurrences is evident. In this context, numerous studies confirmed the link between extreme meteorological events and the lightning activity. The possibility of having short-term predictions of the intensity of lightning phenomena would allow the near-real time monitoring of the evolution of such events. This paper proposes a multidisciplinary approach aiming at developing a regression algorithm to nowcast the density of cloud-to-ground lightning strokes one hour in advance. The proposed algorithm is developed thanks to the possibility to operate jointly with remote sensing imagery, numerical weather prediction model outcomes, and historical information on lightning. The possible dependence between meteorological data and lightning is seeked using Gaussian process regression models. The results obtained suggest that the proposed model can estimate low numbers of strokes accurately, whereas larger numbers of strokes are underestimated. Nevertheless, their presence is correctly detected. This suggests the potential of the proposed method as a processing tool to support the management of weather-related hazards.",

In this paper, we present a symmetrized form of this complex kernel, integrating it with global energy minimization techniques, and show that it provides more accurate predictions.

      "abstract": "Most of the papers in the literature concerning the detection and evaluation of particular features from medical images (i.e., trauma, infections, etc.) are based on supervised techniques that always require large amounts of annotated data. On the contrary, in this work a completely unsupervised method is proposed, inspired by a previous 2D approach to segmentation, reformulated and extended to the case of 3D tomographic images. The method uses a flooding algorithm for the extraction of regions in the lung area, followed by the association with the corresponding statistical model by parametric estimation. A maximum a posteriori estimate of the 3D label map is obtained by modeling the image as a Markov Random Field that includes space-contextual information by means of a simple local proximity model for inter-voxel dependence. At this level, the problem is reformulated in terms of energy minimization, which is addressed using the α - β swap graph-cut algorithm. The proposed method was tested on 3D lung images in order to delineate infections from CT scans of the chest. A set of COVID-19 confirmed patients was then considered, and the results obtained showed accurate detection ability and remarkable robustness to the heterogeneity of CT scans considered.",

      "abstract": "Innovative membrane filtration plants for municipal wastewaters are being developed and need the support of reliable filtration models in the designing phase. In the past, semi-empirical filtration models for membrane processes have been proposed. At present, the most prominent works point out the importance of particle poly-dispersity in the development of reliable models but fail into the implementation of probability density functions (PDFs) capable of an accurate fitting of the experimental particle size distribution (PSD). We report the experimental PSDs of two different municipal wastewater samples, obtained through the laser diffraction technique. The experimental results show that the laser diffraction technique can characterize wastewater particle dimensions both in the colloidal and supra-colloidal regions. The experimental study is complemented by a comparative analysis in which many PDFs are used to fit the experimental PSDs through a least-squares approach. Some of these PDFs are proposed here for the first time to fit experimental wastewater PSDs. Among the PDFs considered for the statistical modeling, the three-parameter lognormal and the Burr PDFs are demonstrated to provide satisfactory fitting, whereas the other considered functions fail. This result is confirmed by the analysis of both the available wastewater samples.",

      "abstract": "The automatic registration of multisensor remote sensing images is a highly challenging task due to the inherently different physical, statistical, and textural characteristics of the input data. Information-theoretic measures are often used to favor comparing local intensity distributions in the images. In this paper, a novel method based on the combination of a deep learning architecture and a correlation-type area-based functional is proposed for the registration of a multisensor pair of images, including an optical image and a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image. The method makes use of a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) in order to address image-to-image translation across the optical and SAR data sources. Then, once the optical and SAR data are brought to a common domain, an area-based ℓ<sup>2</sup> similarity measure is used together with the COBYLA constrained maximization algorithm for registration purposes. While correlation-type functionals are usually ineffective in the application to multisensor registration, exploiting the image-to-image translation capabilities of cGAN architectures allows moving the complexity of the comparison to the domain adaptation step, thus enabling the use of a simple ℓ<sup>2</sup> similarity measure, favoring high computational efficiency, and opening the possibility to process a large amount of data at runtime. Experiments with multispectral and panchromatic optical data combined with SAR images suggest the effectiveness of this strategy and the capability of the proposed method to achieve more accurate registration as compared to state-of-the-art approaches.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a novel semantic segmentation method of very high resolution remotely sensed images based on fully convolutional networks (FCNs) and feedforward neural networks (FFNNs). The proposed model aims to exploit the intrinsic multiscale information extracted at different convolutional blocks in an FCN by the integration of FFNNs, thus incorporating information at different scales. The purpose is to obtain accurate classification results with realistic data sets characterized by sparse ground truth (GT) data by taking benefit from multiscale and long-range spatial information. The final loss function is computed as a linear combination of the weighted cross-entropy losses of the FFNNs and of the FCN. The modeling of spatial-contextual information is further addressed by the introduction of an additional loss term which allows to integrate spatial information between neighboring pixels. The experimental validation is conducted with the ISPRS 2D Semantic Labeling Challenge data set over the city of Vaihingen, Germany. The results are promising, as the proposed approach obtains higher average classification results than the state-of-the-art techniques considered, especially in the case of scarce, suboptimal GTs.",

      "abstract": "Decision fusion allows making a common decision by combining multiple opinions. In the context of remote sensing classification, such techniques are of great importance in all the cases where data collected by multiple sensors are merged into a final decision. Decision fusion may be used to combine the posterior probabilities associated with the output of single classifiers when applied to single sensor data. Meanwhile, techniques such as Markov Random Fields (MRFs) can integrate contextual information in the fusion process and are commonly used in classification. However, in the context of very large scale mapping (e.g., for global climate change monitoring), computation time can be critical and the application of both data fusion and spatial-contextual modeling comes with several constraints. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian decision fusion approach for optical-SAR image classification, integrated with a fast formulation of the iterated conditional modes (ICM) MRF-optimization algorithm based on a convolution operation. he validation on wide areas of Siberia proved the scalability and efficiency of the method for large scale applications.",

      "abstract": "Scene classification of remote sensing images is a challenging task due to the complexity and variety of natural scenes. In recent years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved impressive performances in many remote sensing scene classification benchmarks. However, in CNNs the long-range visual dependencies are often neglected due to the local filter design, leading to suboptimal performances in cluttered scenes such as urban areas. Recently proposed Transformer architecture resolved this issue by taking a broader neighborhood into account through the multi-head self-attention component. In this paper, we propose a novel method which borrows ideas from 'knowledge distillation' and applied to recent vision Transformers. Specifically, we propose a compound loss computed on a Transformer-based student and a CNN teacher in a joint fashion and utilize it for the task of single-label scene classification. Because of the student's capability in capturing long-range visual dependencies, along with the inductive bias inherited from the teacher, our proposed model improves the classification accuracy on four well-known datasets compared to state-of-the-art approaches.",

Information-theoretic measures capable of comparing local intensity distributions are often used for multisensor optical-SAR registration. Moreover, the growing availability of such heterogeneous data from current space missions require multisensor registration methods able to run on large-scale datasets with acceptable computation times. In this paper, a novel method is proposed combining information-theoretic area-based registration with a sequential image tiling strategy. Experiments with optical-SAR data collected by a variety of sensors (Sentinel, Landsat, ERS, etc.) suggest both qualitatively and quantitatively the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in achieving accurate registration with low computational cost.",

      "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) is currently the dominant approach to image classification and segmentation, but the performances of DL methods are remarkably influenced by the quantity and quality of the ground truth (GT) used for training. In this article, a DL method is presented to deal with the semantic segmentation of very-high-resolution (VHR) remote-sensing data in the case of scarce GT. The main idea is to combine a specific type of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), namely fully convolutional networks (FCNs), with probabilistic graphical models (PGMs). Our method takes advantage of the intrinsic multiscale behavior of FCNs to deal with multiscale data representations and to connect them to a hierarchical Markov model (e.g., making use of a quadtree). As a consequence, the spatial information present in the data is better exploited, allowing a reduced sensitivity to GT incompleteness to be obtained. The marginal posterior mode (MPM) criterion is used for inference in the proposed framework. To assess the capabilities of the proposed method, the experimental validation is conducted with the ISPRS 2D Semantic Labeling Challenge datasets on the cities of Vaihingen and Potsdam, with some modifications to simulate the spatially sparse GTs that are common in real remote-sensing applications. The results are quite significant, as the proposed approach exhibits a higher producer accuracy than the standard FCNs considered and especially mitigates the impact of scarce GTs on minority classes and small spatial details.",

      "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) represent the new reference approach for semantic segmentation of very-high-resolution (VHR) images, due to their ability to automatically capture semantic information while learning relevant features. However, as for most supervised methods, the map accuracy depends on the quantity and quality of ground truth (GT) used to train them. The use of densely annotated data (i.e., a detailed, exhaustive, pixel-level GT) allows to obtain effective CNN models but normally implies high efforts in annotation. Such ground truth is often available in benchmark datasets on which new methods are tested, but not on real data for land-cover applications, where only sparse annotations might be sufficiently cost effective. A CNN model trained with such incomplete GT maps has the tendency to smooth object boundaries because they are never precisely delineated in the GT. To cope with those shortcomings, we propose to exploit the intermediate activation maps of the CNN and to deploy a semisupervised fully connected conditional random field (CRF). In comparison with competitors using the same sparse annotations, the proposed method is able to better fill part of the performance gap compared to a CNN trained on the densely annotated, but generally unavailable, GTs.",

Existing approaches train the networks by exploiting supervised information of the change areas, which, however, is not always available. A main challenge in the unsupervised problem setting is to avoid that change pixels affect the learning of the translation function. We propose two new network architectures trained with loss functions weighted by priors that reduce the impact of change pixels on the learning objective. The change prior is derived in an unsupervised fashion from relational pixel information captured by domain-specific affinity matrices. Specifically, we use the vertex degrees associated with an absolute affinity difference matrix and demonstrate their utility in combination with cycle consistency and adversarial training.

      "abstract": "This chapter presents an overview of the major concepts and of the recent literature in the area of remote sensing data fusion. It describes two advanced methods for the joint supervised classification of multimission image time series, including multisensor optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) components acquired at multiple spatial resolutions. The two techniques address different problems of supervised classification of satellite image time series and share a common methodological formulation based on hierarchical Markov random field models. The use of multisensor data in image classification has become increasingly popular with the increased availability of sophisticated software and hardware facilities to handle the increasing volumes of data. A major property of the proposed hierarchical Markovian framework is its flexibility. The graphical architecture associated with multiple quad-trees in cascade allows the incorporation of input image sources associated with different sensors, acquisition times and spatial resolutions - jointly.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to address the monitoring of the recovery phase in the aftermath of Hurricane Matthew (28 September–10 October 2016) in the town of Jérémie, southwestern Haiti. This is accomplished via a novel change detection method that has been formulated, in a data fusion perspective, in terms of multitemporal supervised classification. The availability of very high resolution images provided by last-generation satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical sensors makes this analysis promising from an application perspective and simultaneously challenging from a processing viewpoint. Indeed, pursuing such a goal requires the development of novel meth-odologies able to exploit the large amount of detailed information provided by this type of data. To take advantage of the temporal and spatial information associated with such images, the proposed method integrates multisensor, multisource, and contextual information. Markov random field modeling is adopted here to integrate the spatial context and the temporal correlation associated with images acquired at different dates. Moreover, the adoption of a region-based approach allows for the characterization of the geometrical structures in the images through multiple segmentation maps at different scales and times. The performances of the proposed approach are evaluated on multisensor pairs of COSMO-SkyMed SAR and Pléiades optical images acquired over Jérémie, in the aftermath of and during the three years after Hurricane Matthew. The effectiveness of the change detection results is analyzed both quantitatively, through the computation of accuracy measures on a test set, and qualitatively, by visual inspection of the classification maps. The robust-ness of the proposed method with respect to different algorithmic choices is also assessed, and the detected changes are discussed in relation to the recovery endeavors in the area and ground-truth data collected in the field in April 2019.",

      "abstract": "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are mainly designed to deal with sequence prediction problems and they show their effectiveness in processing data originally represented as time series. This paper investigates the time series characteristics of RNNs to classify touch modalities represented as spatio temporal 3D tensor data. Different approaches are followed in order to propose efficient RNN models aimed at tactile data classification. The main idea is to capture long-term dependence from data that can be used to deal with long sequences represented by employing Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architectures. Moreover, a case specific approach to dataset organization of the 3D tensor data is presented. The target is to provide efficient hardware-friendly touch modality classification approaches suitable for embedded applications. To this end, the proposed work achieves effective performance in terms of hardware complexity by reducing the FLOPS by 99.98% and the memory storage by 98.34%, with respect to the state-of-art solutions on the same benchmark dataset. This directly affects the time latency and energy consumption of the embedded hardware. Besides, the implemented models shows a classification accuracy higher than those state-of-art solutions. Results demonstrate that the proposed computing architecture is scalable showing acceptable complexity when the system is scaled up in terms of input matrix size and number of classes to be recognized.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, a hierarchical probabilistic graphical model is proposed to tackle joint classification of multiresolution and multisensor remote sensing images of the same scene. This problem is crucial in the study of satellite imagery and jointly involves multiresolution and multisensor image fusion. The proposed framework consists of a hierarchical Markov model with a quadtree structure to model information contained in different spatial scales, a planar Markov model to account for contextual spatial information at each resolution, and decision tree ensembles for pixelwise modeling. This probabilistic graphical model and its topology are especially fit for application to very high resolution (VHR) image data. The theoretical properties of the proposed model are analyzed: the causality of the whole framework is mathematically proved, granting the use of time-efficient inference algorithms such as the marginal posterior mode criterion, which is non-iterative when applied to quadtree structures. This is mostly advantageous for classification methods linked to multiresolution tasks formulated on hierarchical Markov models. Within the proposed framework, two multimodal classification algorithms are developed, that incorporate Markov mesh and spatial Markov chain concepts. The results obtained in the experimental validation conducted with two datasets containing VHR multispectral, panchromatic, and radar satellite images, verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The proposed approach is also compared to previous methods that are based on alternate strategies for multimodal fusion.",

      "abstract": "The method presented in this paper for semantic segmentation of multiresolution remote sensing images involves convolutional neural networks (CNNs), in particular fully convolutional networks (FCNs), and hierarchical probabilistic graphical models (PGMs). These approaches are combined to overcome the limitations in classification accuracy of CNNs for small or non-exhaustive ground truth (GT) datasets. Hierarchical PGMs, e.g., hierarchical Markov random fields (MRFs), are structured output learning models that exploit information contained at different image scales. This perfectly matches the intrinsically multiscale behavior of the processes of a CNN (e.g., pooling layers). The framework consists of a hierarchical MRF on a quadtree and a planar Markov model on each layer, modeling the interactions among pixels and accounting for both the multiscale and the spatial-contextual information. The marginal posterior mode criterion is used for inference. The adopted FCN is the U-Net and the experimental validation is conducted on the ISPRS 2D Semantic Labeling Challenge Vaihingen dataset, with some modifications to approach the case of scarce GTs and to assess the classification accuracy of the proposed technique. The proposed framework attains a higher recall compared to the considered FCNs, progressively more relevant as the training set is further from the ideal case of exhaustive GTs.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, a novel method to deal with the semantic segmentation of very high resolution remote sensing data is presented. Recent advances in deep learning (DL), especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and fully convolutional networks (FCNs), have shown outstanding performances in this task. However, the map accuracy depends on the quantity and quality of ground truth (GT) used to train them. At the same time, probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) have sparked even more interest in the past few years, because of the ever-growing need for structured predictions. The novel method proposed in this paper combines DL and PGMs to perform remote sensing image classification. FCNs can be exploited to deal with multiscale data through the integration with a hierarchical Markov model. The marginal posteri- or mode (MPM) criterion for inference is used in the proposed framework. Experimental validation is conducted on the ISPRS 2D Semantic Labeling Challenge Vaihingen dataset. The results are significant, as the proposed method has a higher recall than the standard FCNs considered and allows mitigating the impact of incomplete or suboptimal GT, especially with regard to the discrimination of minoritary classes.",

The registration process is composed of several steps: feature definition, feature comparison and optimization of a geometric transformation between the images. Feature definition can be done using simple traditional filtering or more complex deep learning (DL) methods. In this paper, two traditional approaches and a DL approach are compared. One can then wonder if the complexity of DL is worth to address the registration task. The aim of this paper is to quantitatively compare approaches rooted in distinct methodological areas on two common datasets with different resolutions.

In the present paper, this problem is addressed in the case of optical-SAR images by proposing a novel method based on deep learning and area-based registration concepts. The method integrates a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN), an area-based cross-correlation-type \\ell^{2} similarity metric, and the COBYLA constrained maximization algorithm. Whereas correlation-type metrics are typically ineffective in the application to multisensor registration, the proposed approach allows exploiting the image translation capabilities of cGAN architectures to enable the use of an \\ell^{2} similarity metric, which favors high computational efficiency. Experiments with Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data suggest the effectiveness of this strategy and the capability of the proposed method to achieve accurate registration.",

It weights the input with a new affinity-based prior, which measures changes in pixel relations across the image domains and is used to reduce the influence of data points prone to change. By this procedure of self-supervision, we adapt the intrinsically supervised architecture to the unsupervised case, noting that the censoring of change pixels is key to efficiently learning the required data transformations. The result is an unsupervised algorithm which allows change detection in either of the image domains, or a combination of those, since efficient domain translation is obtained by coupling cross-domain encoders and decoders.

However, most change detection methods operate under the assumption that the multitemporal input data have been collected with the same (or very similar) acquisition modality - a possibly critical restriction in several applications. In this paper, the problem and the opportunities of change detection from multitemporal data acquired through heterogeneous modalities are addressed. Methodologically, this is a highly challenging data fusion problem, especially within an unsupervised framework. Here, these challenges and the methodological approaches proposed in the literature' which range from earlier semi-parametric regression to current deep learning architectures, are reviewed.

      "abstract": "Because of the large variety of planetary sensors and spacecraft already collecting data and with many new and improved sensors being planned for future missions, planetary science needs to integrate numerous multimodal image sources, and, as a consequence, accurate and robust registration algorithms are required. In this article, we develop a new framework for crater detection based on marked point processes (MPPs) that can be used for planetary image registration. MPPs were found to be effective for various object detection tasks in Earth observation, and a new MPP model is proposed here for detecting craters in planetary data. The resulting spatial features are exploited for registration, together with fitness functions based on the MPP energy, on the mean directed Hausdorff distance, and on the mutual information. Two different methods - one based on birth-death processes and region-of-interest analysis and the other based on graph cuts and decimated wavelets - are developed within the proposed framework. Experiments with a large set of images, including 13 thermal infrared and visible images of the Mars surface, 20 semisimulated multitemporal pairs of images of the Mars surface, and a real multitemporal image pair of the Lunar surface, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in terms of crater detection performance as well as for subpixel registration accuracy.",

The proposed framework makes use of a quadtree to model the interactions across different spatial resolutions and a Markov model with respect to a generic total order relation to deal with contextual information at each scale in order to favor applicability to very high resolution imagery. The methodological properties of the proposed hierarchical framework are investigated. Firstly, we prove the causality of the overall proposed model, a particularly advantageous property in terms of computational cost of the inference. Secondly, we prove the expression of the marginal posterior mode criterion for inference on the proposed framework. Within this framework, a specific algorithm is formulated by defining, within each layer of the quadtree, a Markov chain model with respect to a pixel scan that combines both a zig-zag trajectory and a Hilbert space-filling curve. Data collected by distinct sensors at the same spatial resolution are fused through gradient boosted regression trees. The developed algorithm was experimentally validated with two very high resolution datasets including multispectral, panchromatic and radar satellite images. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm as compared to previous techniques based on alternate approaches to multiresolution fusion.",

      "abstract": "Change detection (CD) in heterogeneous multitemporal satellite images is an emerging and challenging topic in remote sensing. In particular, one of the main challenges is to tackle the problem in an unsupervised manner. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised framework for bitemporal heterogeneous CD based on the comparison of affinity matrices and image regression. First, our method quantifies the similarity of affinity matrices computed from colocated image patches in the two images. This is done to automatically identify pixels that are likely to be unchanged. With the identified pixels as pseudotraining data, we learn a transformation to map the first image to the domain of the other image and vice versa. Four regression methods are selected to carry out the transformation: Gaussian process regression, support vector regression, random forest regression (RFR), and a recently proposed kernel regression method called homogeneous pixel transformation. To evaluate the potentials and limitations of our framework and also the benefits and disadvantages of each regression method, we perform experiments on two real data sets. The results indicate that the comparison of the affinity matrices can already be considered a CD method by itself. However, image regression is shown to improve the results obtained by the previous step alone and produces accurate CD maps despite of the heterogeneity of the multitemporal input data. Notably, the RFR approach excels by achieving similar accuracy as the other methods, but with a significantly lower computational cost and with fast and robust tuning of hyperparameters.",

Despite the supervised classifier used in a data-driven system is trained by samples gathered under one specific design-point operating condition, during real operation the plant can move to a new, unexpected off-design operating condition, reducing the performance of the diagnosis system. This Short Communication demonstrates that this reduction is heavily mitigated if the supervised classifier is adapted to the new condition through the domain adaptation statistical technique. The present study shows that a probability of correct classification between 85% and 94% can be achieved in off-design, when a probability of 95% is obtained at the design-point.",

From an application viewpoint, this problem is of importance in several contexts, including, most remarkably, satellite and aerial imagery. From a methodological perspective, we use a probabilistic graphical approach and adopt a hierarchical Markov mesh framework that we have recently developed and models the spatial-contextual classification of multiresolution and possibly multisensor images. Here, we focus on the methodological properties of this framework. First, we prove the causality of the model, a highly desirable property with respect to the computational cost of the inference. Then, we prove the expression of the marginal posterior mode criterion for this model and discuss the related assumptions. Experimental results with multi-spectral and panchromatic satellite images are also presented.",

Multiresolution and multisensor fusion are jointly achieved through an explicitly hierarchical probabilistic graphical classifier, which uses a quadtree structure to model the interactions across different spatial resolutions, and a symmetric Markov mesh random field to deal with contextual information at each scale and favor applicability to very high resolution imagery. Differently from previous hierarchical Markovian approaches, here, data collected by distinct sensors are fused through either the graph topology itself (across its layers) or decision tree ensemble methods (within each layer). The proposed model allows taking benefit of strong analytical properties, most remarkably causality, which make it possible to apply time-efficient non-iterative inference algorithms.",

The availability of heterogeneous data requires effective methods able to exploit all the available information. In the context of environmental monitoring and natural disaster recovery, this paper proposes an unsupervised change detection method able to properly fuse and exploit multiresolution and multimodality SAR data. The data fusion process is based on the estimation of the virtual images that would have been collected in case all the sensors worked at the same spatial resolution and on the definition of a probabilistic model based on generalized Gaussian distributions and Gram-Charlier approximations. The detection of changes is addressed in a probabilistic graphical framework through a novel conditional random field, by defining an energy function that is minimized through graph-cuts or belief propagation methods.",

      "abstract": "The development of fault diagnosis systems able to early detect and identify any malfunctioning is of great importance towards the diffusion of energy conversion plants based on solid oxide fuel cells. Because the traditional model-based schemes for the diagnosis demonstrated a poor fault identification capability (especially when many operating conditions and fault sizes are combined), hybrid schemes were proposed that, incorporating pattern recognition classifiers, achieved significant performance improvements. However, like in the model-based case, the hybrid schemes require the running of the plant model in parallel to the real plant functioning. In this study, a data-driven fault diagnosis scheme is presented, in which the plant model is used only off-line, for the training of the classifier. Both support vector machine and random forest classifiers are proposed and tested. It is demonstrated that, when a support vector machine classifier is deployed, the data-driven system outperforms the hybrid systems in both fault detection and fault identification. High-level performance is achieved despite the large number of combinations among working conditions and fault sizes used for testing the system.",

      "abstract": "In the framework of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems, current satellite missions make it possible to acquire images at very high and multiple spatial resolutions with short revisit times. This scenario conveys a remarkable potential in applications to, for instance, environmental monitoring and natural disaster recovery. In this context, data fusion and change detection methodologies play major roles. This paper proposes an unsupervised change detection algorithmfor the challenging case of multimodal SAR data collected by sensors operating atmultiple spatial resolutions. The method is based on Markovian probabilistic graphical models, graph cuts, linear mixtures, generalized Gaussian distributions, Gram-Charlier approximations, maximum likelihood and minimum mean squared error estimation. It benefits from the SAR images acquired at multiple spatial resolutions and with possibly different modalities on the considered acquisition times to generate an output change map at the finest observed resolution. This is accomplished by modeling the statistics of the data at the various spatial scales through appropriate generalized Gaussian distributions and by iteratively estimating a set of virtual images that are defined on the pixel grid at the finest resolution and would be collected if all the sensors could work at that resolution. A Markov random field framework is adopted to address the detection problem by defining an appropriate multimodal energy function that is minimized using graph cuts.",

      "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the new standard for semantic segmentation of very high resolution images. But as for other methods, the map accuracy depends on the quantity and quality of ground truth used to train them. Having densely annotated data, i.e. a detailed, pixel-level ground truth (GT), allows obtaining effective models, but requires high efforts in annotation. For this reason, it is more common and efficient to work with point or scribbled annotations rather than with dense ones. A CNN model trained with such incomplete ground truths tends to mischaracterize the shapes of the objects and to be inaccurate near their boundaries. We propose to use an approximation of a fully connected Conditional Random Field (CRF) to solve these issues, in which long range connections are accounted for through auxiliary nodes based on clustering of CNN activation features. Experiments on the ISPRS Vaihingen benchmark, where a CNN is trained only with a non-dense, scribbled ground truth, show that the proposed method can fill part of the performance gap with respect to models trained on the densely annotated, but unrealistic, ground truth.",

In this paper we propose a framework, based on image regression, to perform change detection in heterogeneous multitemporal satellite images, which has become a main topic in remote sensing. Our method learns a transformation to map the first image to the domain of the other image, and vice versa. Four regression methods are selected to carry out the transformation: Gaussian processes, support vector machines, random forests, and a recently proposed kernel regression method called homogeneous pixel transformation. To evaluate not only potentials and limitations of our framework, but also the pros and cons of each regression method, we perform experiments on two data sets. The results indicates that random forests achieve good performance, are fast and robust to hyperparameters, whereas the homogeneous pixel transformation method can achieve better accuracy at the cost of a higher complexity.",

      "abstract": "Classification of remotely sensed images into land cover or land use is highly dependent on geographical information at least at two levels. First, land cover classes are observed in a spatially smooth domain separated by sharp region boundaries. Second, land classes and observation scale are also tightly intertwined: they tend to be consistent within areas of homogeneous appearance, or regions, in the sense that all pixels within a roof should be classified as roof, independently on the spatial support used for the classification. In this paper, we follow these two observations and encode them as priors in an energy minimization framework based on conditional random fields (CRFs), where classification results obtained at pixel and region levels are probabilistically fused. The aim is to enforce the final maps to be consistent not only in their own spatial supports (pixel and region) but also across supports, i.e., by getting the predictions on the pixel lattice and on the set of regions to agree. To this end, we define an energy function with three terms: 1) a data term for the individual elements in each support (support-specific nodes); 2) spatial regularization terms in a neighborhood for each of the supports (support-specific edges); and 3) a regularization term between individual pixels and the region containing each of them (intersupports edges). We utilize these priors in a unified energy minimization problem that can be optimized by standard solvers. The proposed 2LCRF model consists of a CRF defined over a bipartite graph, i.e., two interconnected layers within a single graph accounting for interlattice connections. 2LCRF is tested on two very high-resolution data sets involving submetric satellite and subdecimeter aerial data. In all cases, 2LCRF improves the result obtained by the independent base model (either random forests or convolutional neural networks) and by standard CRF models enforcing smoothness in the spatial domain.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we present the scientific outcomes of the 2017 Data Fusion Contest organized by the Image Analysis and Data Fusion Technical Committee of the IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society. The 2017 Contest was aimed at addressing the problem of local climate zones classification based on a multitemporal and multimodal dataset, including image (Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2) and vector data (from OpenStreetMap). The competition, based on separate geographical locations for the training and testing of the proposed solution, aimed at models that were accurate (assessed by accuracy metrics on an undisclosed reference for the test cities), general (assessed by spreading the test cities across the globe), and computationally feasible (assessed by having a test phase of limited time). The techniques proposed by the participants to the Contest spanned across a rather broad range of topics, and of mixed ideas and methodologies deriving from computer vision and machine learning but also deeply rooted in the specificities of remote sensing. In particular, rigorous atmospheric correction, the use of multidate images, and the use of ensemble methods fusing results obtained from different data sources/time instants made the difference.",

      "abstract": "This paper describes a method dedicated to multi-resolution, multi-date and eventually multi-sensor classification based on explicit statistical modeling through hierarchical Markov random field modeling based on quad-Tree. The proposed approach consists in a supervised Bayesian classifier that combines a joint class-conditional statistical model for pixelwise information and a hierarchical Markov random field for spatio-Temporal and multiresolution contextual information fusion based on the Marginal Posterior Mode (MPM). The aim is to recursively maximize the posterior marginal at each pixel, which associates the most probable class label given the entire input information. Within this framework, an interesting novel element of the proposed approach is the use of multiple quadtrees in cascade, each associated with a new image in the available set in order to characterize the correlations associated with distinct images in the data set.",

      "abstract": "Current and forthcoming sensor technologies and space missions are providing remote sensing scientists and practitioners with an increasing wealth and variety of data modalities. They encompass multisensor, multiresolution, multiscale, multitemporal, multipolarization, and multifrequency imagery. While they represent remarkable opportunities for the applications, they pose important challenges to the development of mathematical methods aimed at fusing the information conveyed by the input multisource data. In this framework, the present chapter continues the discussion of remote sensing data fusion, which was opened in the previous chapter. Here, the focus is on data fusion for image classification purposes. Both methodological issues of feature extraction and supervised classification are addressed. On both respects, the focus is on hierarchical image models rooted in graph theory. First, multilevel feature extraction is addressed through the latest advances in Mathematical Morphology and attribute profile theory with respect to component trees and trees of shapes. Then, joint supervised classification of multisensor, multiscale, multiresolution, and multitemporal imagery is formulated through hierarchical Markov random fields on quad-trees. Examples of experimental results with data from current VHR optical and SAR missions are shown and analysed.",

      "abstract": "The current progress of remote sensing systems, based on airborne and spaceborne platforms and involving active and passive sensors, provides an unprecedented wealth of information about the Earth surface for environmental monitoring, sustainable resource management, disaster prevention, emergency response, and defense. In this framework, mathematical models for image processing and analysis play fundamental roles. Effectively exploiting the potential conveyed by the availability of remote sensing data requires automatic or semi-automatic techniques capable of suitably characterizing and extracting thematic information of interest while minimizing the need for user intervention. The current development of mathematical models and methods for image processing and computer vision allows multiple remote sensing information extraction problems to be addressed successfully, accurately, and efficiently. In this introductory chapter, first, general characteristics of sensors and systems for Earth observation are summarized to define the basic terminology that will be used consistently throughout the book. Remote sensing image acquisition through passive and active sensors on-board spaceborne and airborne platforms is recalled together with the basic concepts of spatial, spectral, temporal, and radiometric resolution. Then, an overview of the main families of mathematical models and methods within the scientific field of two-dimensional remote sensing image processing is presented. The overall structure and organization of the book are also described.",

      "abstract": "In order to ensure homogeneity in performance assessment of proposed algorithms for information extraction in the Earth Observation (EO) domain, standardized remotely sensed datasets are particularly useful and welcome. Fully aware of this principle, the IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society (GRSS) and especially its Image Analysis and Data Fusion Technical Committee (IADF), has been organizing for some years now the Data Fusion Contest (DFC). In the DFC, one specific dataset is made available to the scientific community, which can download it and use it to test its newly developed algorithms. The consistence of the starting dataset across participating groups ensures the significance of assessing and ranking results, to finally proclaim the winner who scored the highest. More recently, the IEEE GRSS has provided one more contribution to the standardization effort by building the Data and Algorithm Standard Evaluation (DASE) website. DASE can distribute to registered users a limited set of possible 'standard' open datasets, together with some ground truth info, and automatically assess the processing results provided by the users. In this paper we report on the birth of this initiative and present some recently introduced features.",

      "abstract": "Because of the large variety of sensors and spacecraft collecting data, planetary science needs to integrate various multisensor and multitemporal images. These multiple data represent a precious asset, as they allow the study of target spectral responses and of changes in the surface structure. Because of their variety, they also require accurate and robust registration. A new crater detection algorithm, used to extract features to be integrated in an image registration framework, is presented. A marked point process-based method has been developed to model the spatial distribution of elliptical objects (i.e. the craters), and a birth-death Markov chain method, coupled with a region-based scheme aiming at computational efficiency, is used to find the optimal configuration fitting the image. The extracted features are exploited, together with a newly defined fitness function based on a modified Hausdorff distance, by an image registration algorithm whose architecture has been designed to minimize the computation time.",

Firstly, the most relevant craters are extracted from the two images to register, and then, registration is performed in two steps. The first step matches the craters extracted from the images based on a generalized Hausdorff distance. In the second step, the mutual information between the two images is maximized to achieve high registration accuracy. Craters are detected by a stochastic-geometry approach based on a marked point process model and of a multiple-birth-and-cut energy minimization algorithm. The experimental validation is carried out with 13 images for the crater extraction stage, and with 20 semi-synthetic pairs of images with ground truth and several images extracted from actual multitemporal lunar scenes for the registration phase.",

The 2016 Contest was an open topic competition based on a multitemporal and multimodal dataset, which included a temporal pair of very high resolution panchromatic and multispectral Deimos-2 images and a video captured by the Iris camera on-board the International Space Station. The problems addressed and the techniques proposed by the participants to the Contest spanned across a rather broad range of topics, and mixed ideas and methodologies from the remote sensing, video processing, and computer vision. In particular, the winning team developed a deep learning method to jointly address spatial scene labeling and temporal activity modeling using the available image and video data. The second place team proposed a random field model to simultaneously perform coregistration of multitemporal data, semantic segmentation, and change detection. The methodological key ideas of both these approaches and the main results of the corresponding experimental validation are discussed in this paper.",

      "abstract": "Diagnostics and prognostics of natural gas steam reforming (NGSR) reactors are of utmost importance for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) systems, where a fuel processor fault can cause damage to the SOFC stack. Most common faults are due to carbon deposition. We investigate this phenomenon through a model based on microscopic mass, energy and momentum balances of a tubular NGSR reactor. The model includes a detailed local reaction kinetics specific for Ni-based catalysts, and is integrated numerically using a finite element method (FEM) implemented through COMSOL Multiphysics 5.2. Results obtained from the simulation of a laboratory scale reactor are validated on the basis of literature data. Furthermore, the model is applied to an NGSR fuel processor designed for an 1.1 kW SOFC system. The model allows to identify the area where carbon deposition is expected to occur, which is a key feature in view of developing specific diagnostic and prognostic tools. The simulation results demonstrate that safety criteria based on the feedstock steam to carbon (S/C) ratio can be misleading in a number of operating conditions.",

      "abstract": "In recent decades, urban sprawl became a serious European-wide problem, not only due to total land taken, but also due to its spatial distribution patterns and quality of the land consumed. Land use efficiency is becoming a prime political objective at both European and city level, and the EU Land Communication aims to establish 'zero net land take' across the EU by 2050. Land is a finite resource and therefore the sprawl has to be regulated. This can be realized through careful management of urban land, applying the concept of urban land transformation. The other main concern of sustainable city panning is the preservation and improvement of the Green Infrastructure in the cities. Only such approaches can assure sustainable development of European urban and suburban landscape as well as of quality of environment and life in the cities in the long term perspective. The EU funded URBIS project (ICT PSP 2014-17) targets these issues and focuses on investigation of open space potential in urban areas, and the opportunities for inner development, as well as on investigation of urban green systems. URBIS delivers EO based methodologies and tools to provide accurate up-to-date intelligence that is comparable across European cities to support the definition and implementation of sustainable planning and governance strategies in cities and city-regions throughout Europe. The present paper focuses on the role, within the URBIS methodologies and products, of remote sensing image analysis. Classification, feature extraction, and multitemporal analysis approaches are combined to characterize open, green, and sealed areas within large urban zones.",

Specifically, we map the region of NorthRhine-Westfalia (Germany), a region of approx. 34′000 km<sup>2</sup>, in terms of LCZ, with a statistical model trained using multimodal geospatial data (remote sensing, land cover, 3D models and volunteered geographic information) and constrained with both spatial interaction and scaling behavior logics. The proposed model improves LCZ classification accuracy, in particular for scarce classes, with an increase of up to 4 κ points and 5% in average accuracy as compared to conventional pixelwise classification.",

The following strategies are elaborated on: kernel methods, neural network methods, manifold learning methods, structured output methods, ensemble learning methods, and sparse learning methods. This specific choice is based on the frequency with which these strategies appeared in the recent remote sensing literature. Each subsection contains a short description of the specific machine learning paradigm and an extensive description of the recent state of the art, with a conceptual description of the new methodologies. We end with some insights in future developments.",

This paper focuses on comparison of image pairs covering the same geographical area and acquired by two different sensors, one optical radiometer and one synthetic aperture radar, at two different times. We propose a clustering-based technique to detect changes, identified as clusters that split or merge in the different images. To evaluate potentials and limitations of our method, we perform experiments on real data. Preliminary results confirm the relationship between splits and merges of clusters and the occurrence of changes. However, it becomes evident that it is necessary to incorporate prior, ancillary, or application-specific information to improve the interpretation of clustering results and to identify unambiguously the areas of change.",

The use of spatial information, accounting for neighborhood relationship and spatial smoothness of geographical objects, made its proofs in countless occasions and, especially when considering very high resolution images, methods ignoring spatial context do not perform well.

We formulate these intuitions as a standard energy minimization problem, and we show that finding a joint solution over both output spaces leads to strong improvements in the numerical and visual senses.",

In this paper, an unsupervised change detection method for SAR images at medium to high resolution is proposed. The image ratioing approach is adopted, and a Bayesian unsupervised minimum-error thresholding algorithm is extended by proposing a technique based on Generalized Gamma distributions (GΓD). GΓD was recently found to be an accurate model for the statistics of SAR amplitudes at moderate to high resolution. Here, a specific parametric modeling approach for the ratio of G D-distributed SAR images is proposed and endowed with a probability density function estimation algorithm based on the method of log-cumulants. Consistency of this estimator is proven. Experimental results confirm the accuracy of the method for medium and high resolutions X-band SAR images.",

Nonetheless, the generation of land cover maps using this innovative kind of remote sensing data has been scarcely studied so far. The aim of this article is to experimentally investigate the potential of various supervised classification approaches to land cover mapping from high spatial resolution thermal hyperspectral images. The considered methods include both non-contextual and spatial-contextual classifiers, and encompass methodological approaches based on Bayesian decision theory, Markov random fields, multiscale region-based analysis, and Bayesian feature reduction. Experiments were conducted with a challenging data set associated with a complex urban and vegetated scene. Overall accurate results were achieved by using contextual approaches. The validation suggested the effectiveness of pattern recognition tools in the application to this innovative typology of remote sensing data while also indicating potential improvements through the fusion with physically-based methods.",

The proposed classifier is based on an explicit hierarchical graph-based model that is sufficiently flexible to address a coregistered time series of images collected at different spatial resolutions. Within this framework, a novel element of the proposed approach is the use of multiple quadtrees in cascade, each associated with the images available at each observation date in the considered time series. For each date, the input images are inserted in a hierarchical structure on the basis of their resolutions, whereas missing levels are filled in with wavelet transforms of the images embedded in finer-resolution levels. This approach is aimed at both exploiting multiscale information, which is known to play a crucial role in high-resolution image analysis, and supporting input images acquired at different resolutions in the input time series. The experimental results are shown for multitemporal and multiresolution optical data.",

We propose a novel empirical-Bayesian approach that is based on a false discovery rate formulation for statistical inference on local patch-based samples. This alternative error metric allows to efficiently adjust the family-wise error rate in case of the considered large-scale testing problem. The designed change detector operates in an unsupervised manner under the assumption of the limited amount of changes in the analyzed imagery. The detection is based on the use of various statistical features, which enable the detector to address application-specific detection problems provided an appropriate ad hoc feature choice. In particular, we demonstrate the use of the rank-based statistics: Wilcoxon and Cramér-von Mises for image pairs, and multisample Levene statistic for short image sequences. The experiments with remotely sensed radar, dermatological, and still camera surveillance imagery demonstrate accurate performance and flexibility of the proposed method.",

      "abstract": "The problem of supervised classification of multiresolution images, which are composed of a higher resolution panchromatic channel and of several coarser resolution multispectral channels, is addressed in this paper by proposing a novel contextual method based on Markov random fields. The method iteratively exploits a linear mixture model for the relationships between data at different resolutions and a graph cut approach to Markovian energy minimization to generate a contextual classification map at the highest resolution available in the input data set. The estimation of the parameters of the method is performed by extending recently proposed techniques based on the expectation-maximization and Ho-Kashyap's algorithms. The method is experimentally validated with semisimulated and real data involving both IKONOS and Landsat-7 ETM+ images, and the results are compared with those generated by previous approaches to the classification of multiresolution imagery.",

      "abstract": "The success of distributed power generation by plants based on solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) is hindered by reliability problems that can be mitigated through an effective fault detection and isolation (FDI) system. However, the numerous operating conditions under which such plants can operate and the random size of the possible faults make identifying damaged plant components starting from the physical variables measured in the plant very difficult. In this context, we assess two classical FDI strategies (model-based with fault signature matrix and data-driven with statistical classification) and the combination of them. For this assessment, a quantitative model of the SOFC-based plant, which is able to simulate regular and faulty conditions, is used. Moreover, a hybrid approach based on the random forest (RF) classification method is introduced to address the discrimination of regular and faulty situations due to its practical advantages. Working with a common dataset, the FDI performances obtained using the aforementioned strategies, with different sets of monitored variables, are observed and compared. We conclude that the hybrid FDI strategy, realized by combining a model-based scheme with a statistical classifier, outperforms the other strategies. In addition, the inclusion of two physical variables that should be measured inside the SOFCs can significantly improve the FDI performance, despite the actual difficulty in performing such measurements.",

The proposed approach integrates an explicit hierarchical graph-based classifier, which uses a quad-tree structure to model multiscale interactions, and a third order Markov mesh random field to deal with pixel wise contextual information in the same scale. The choice of a quad-tree and the third order Markov mesh allow taking benefit from their good analytical properties (especially causality) and consequently apply non-iterative algorithms. Indeed, the Markov mesh is used to incorporate spatial information in each scale of the quad-tree while keeping the causality of the hierarchical model.",

We propose the use of a quantitative model for such a plant (validated by real experiments) with a support vector machine (SVM) to detect and classify possible faults. The adoption of a classification approach as an identification strategy in a model-based fault diagnosis process represents a major innovation in the field of SOFC plants. Constant-voltage and constant-current control strategies are investigated. In both cases, an adequately trained SVM classifier is used to provide a high probability of correct classification when the plant functions at different steady-state operating conditions for random sizes of the considered faults and for realistic magnitudes of the errors affecting the model predictions. In addition, the relative importance of the easy-to-measure residuals, which are used as features in the SVM classification process, are discussed based on an advanced feature selection technique.",

      "abstract": "This chapter is focused on the development of pattern recognition methodologies for the application to fuel cells (FCs). FC technology currently represents a remarkable opportunity for distributed and vehicular electric generation. However, FCs may be subject to various types of fault. The fault diagnosis systems proposed so far generally apply the model-based scheme, and identify fault types through case-specific inference approaches that use heuristic ad hoc tree classifiers and binarized residuals (i.e., differences between measured and predicted physical variables). Here, we demonstrate that high detection accuracy is achieved if the binarization of the residuals is avoided and suitable kernel-based learning techniques are applied instead of these heuristic inference approaches. This strategy enables accurate fault discrimination when the plant functions at different steady-state operating conditions, the sizes of the considered faults take on arbitrary values in large ranges, and model prediction errors of realistic magnitudes are considered. The results obtained using a support vector machine, combining it with a joint feature and model selection technique, and deploying a quantitative model for a laboratory-scale solid oxide FC generation plant support this conclusion.",

It addresses the issue of iteratively querying most informative training samples with a special focus on spatial-contextual image classification. With the aim to utilize all information during the learning process, the proposed heuristic queries unlabeled pixels considering spectral-spatial inconsistency (SSI), i.e., the unlabeled pixels whose spectral and spatial information indicate different class labels are favored in the active selection. To model spectral-spatial information, a Markov random field (MRF), in which the unary term is defined using the output of a support vector machine and the pairwise term is defined by a multilevel logistic model, is adopted. A new approach to the estimation of the parameters of this MRF model is also incorporated in the proposed method. It aims at taking benefit of spatial information by using the pixels which are representative of the inter-class spatial transitions. A high resolution remotely sensed image is used in the experiments, and the proposed method is proved to be feasible and accurate.",

      "abstract": "Earth observation through remote sensing images allows the accurate characterization and identification of materials on the surface from space and airborne platforms. Multiple and heterogeneous image sources can be available for the same geographical region: multispectral, hyperspectral, radar, multitemporal, and multiangular images can today be acquired over a given scene. These sources can be combined/fused to improve classification of the materials on the surface. Even if this type of systems is generally accurate, the field is about to face new challenges: the upcoming constellations of satellite sensors will acquire large amounts of images of different spatial, spectral, angular, and temporal resolutions. In this scenario, multimodal image fusion stands out as the appropriate framework to address these problems. In this paper, we provide a taxonomical view of the field and review the current methodologies for multimodal classification of remote sensing images. We also highlight the most recent advances, which exploit synergies with machine learning and signal processing: sparse methods, kernel-based fusion, Markov modeling, and manifold alignment. Then, we illustrate the different approaches in seven challenging remote sensing applications: 1) multiresolution fusion for multispectral image classification; 2) image downscaling as a form of multitemporal image fusion and multidimensional interpolation among sensors of different spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions; 3) multiangular image classification; 4) multisensor image fusion exploiting physically-based feature extractions; 5) multitemporal image classification of land covers in incomplete, inconsistent, and vague image sources; 6) spatiospectral multisensor fusion of optical and radar images for change detection; and 7) cross-sensor adaptation of classifiers. The adoption of these techniques in operational settings will help to monitor our planet from space in the very near future.",

The activity builds on the result of a previous Atlas project that produced high-resolution land use maps for 305 European LUZ and their surroundings (with population over 100.000 inhabitants). This paper focuses on the presentation of URBIS project objectives and scope, and the methodology applied by the research unit at the University of Genoa for classification and change detection of vacant urban zones performed within this project.",

As for previous years, the IADF TC organized a data fusion contest aiming at fostering new ideas and solutions for multisource remote sensing studies. In the 2014 edition, participants considered multiresolution and multisensor fusion between optical data acquired at 20-cm resolution and long-wave (thermal) infrared hyperspectral data at 1-m resolution. The Contest was proposed as a double-track competition: one aiming at accurate landcover classification and the other seeking innovation in the fusion of thermal hyperspectral and color data. In this paper, the results obtained by the winners of both tracks are presented and discussed.",

We demonstrate that the proposed technique contributes to the solution of an open research problem: to design a robust FDI procedure, correctly functioning with different operating conditions and fault sizes, specifically settled for an electric generation system based on solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). By using a quantitative model of the generation system coupled to an optimized SVM classifier, a satisfactory FDI procedure is achieved, which is robust against modeling and measurement errors and is compliant with practical deployment.",

      "abstract": "The knowledge of air temperature near the Earth's surface plays a relevant role in weather and climate studies as well as in the framework of solar energy management; e.g., for identifying the most suitable locations for a new solar installation or monitoring the performance of existing systems. Remote sensing allows air temperature to be estimated on a spatially distributed basis, thus complementing the spatially sparse observations collected by ground micro-meteorological stations. In this paper, a novel approach to periodic (e.g., daily or monthly) air temperature estimation from satellite images based on support vector machines (SVMs) is proposed. A recently developed SVM-based approach to supervised land and sea surface temperature estimation using satellite images is generalized to the case of air temperature and integrated with case-specific techniques aimed at computing periodic statistics of air temperature using the expectation-maximization algorithm. The method is fully automated and allows the statistics of the estimation error to be modeled on a pixelwise basis. This last result is accomplished by combining nonstationary multidimensional stochastic processes and Clark's variance approximation. The method is experimentally validated with MSG-SEVIRI data acquired over Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur (France).",

      "abstract": "The quantity and the updating time of the archives of very high spatial resolution visible and near-infrared remote sensing images for commercial use improved during the last years. This led to the detection of changes on the Earth surface through remote sensing images to become a key analytical tool for many public and private organizations, which can take advantage of the information carried out to help and improve their decision making processes. This paper proposes an unsupervised method for detecting multiple changes in the application to damage assessment after a flood. It is composed of five steps, and is based on a change vector analysis approach. After a case-specific feature extraction stage, through a process called normalized difference indexing, the change detection task is carried out by modeling the classes of changed and not changed pixels with a Gaussian finite mixture model, using the expectation-maximization algorithm to estimate the statistical parameters involved. Then, the mean shift clustering algorithm is used to discriminate among different types of change. The method has been tested on a pair of images acquired by WorldView-2 and associated with the 2013 flood in Colorado.",

In the proposed method, the MRF minimum-energy problem is formalized in terms of an appropriate SVM kernel expansion and addressed through graph cuts.

First, based on the theory of complex reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS's), a family of admissible kernel functions tailored to the classification of complex-valued features is proposed. Then, a support vector machine (SVM) classifier is developed using this family of kernels and a case-specific interpretation is discussed for the related notion of maximum-margin hyperplane in a complex vector space. Finally, a spatial-contextual classifier is introduced by integrating the proposed family of kernels with a recent combination of SVM and Markov random fields.

      "abstract": "In this paper, we develop a novel classification approach for multiresolution, multisensor [optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR)], and/or multiband images. This challenging image processing problem is of great importance for various remote sensing monitoring applications and has been scarcely addressed so far. To deal with this classification problem, we propose a two-step explicit statistical model. We first design a model for the multivariate joint class-conditional statistics of the coregistered input images at each resolution by resorting to multivariate copulas. Such copulas combine the class-conditional marginal probability density functions (pdfs) of each input channel that are estimated by finite mixtures of well-chosen parametric families. We consider different distribution families for the most common types of remote sensing imagery acquired by optical and SAR sensors. We then plug the estimated joint pdfs into a hierarchical Markovian model based on a quad-tree structure, where each tree-scale corresponds to the different input image resolutions and to corresponding multiscale decimated wavelet transforms, thus preventing a strong resampling of the initial images. To obtain the classification map, we resort to an exact estimator of the marginal posterior mode. We integrate a prior update in this model in order to improve the robustness of the developed classifier against noise and speckle. The resulting classification performance is illustrated on several remote sensing multiresolution data sets, including very high resolution and multisensor images acquired by COSMO-SkyMed and GeoEye-1. © 2013 IEEE.",

This peculiar and challenging scenario is especially interesting in disaster management applications in which SAR acquisitions are feasible both before and after the event and an optical image is available only at one date (e.g., from the archive). The proposed method combines a novel Markov random field model with multiscale region-based analysis in order to fuse the information associated both with the statistics of the ratio of the multitemporal SAR images and with the spatial-geometrical structure of the observed scene captured by the optical image. Parameter estimation is based on a dictionary of parametric families and is carried out through the expectation-maximization algorithm and the method of log-cumulants.

      "abstract": "Parameter estimation of probability density functions is one of the major steps in the area of statistical image and signal processing. In this paper we explore several properties and limitations of the recently proposed method of logarithmic cumulants (MoLC) parameter estimation approach which is an alternative to the classical maximum likelihood (ML) and method of moments (MoM) approaches. We derive the general sufficient condition for a strong consistency of the MoLC estimates which represents an important asymptotic property of any statistical estimator. This result enables the demonstration of the strong consistency of MoLC estimates for a selection of widely used distribution families originating from (but not restricted to) synthetic aperture radar image processing. We then derive the analytical conditions of applicability of MoLC to samples for the distribution families in our selection. Finally, we conduct various synthetic and real data experiments to assess the comparative properties, applicability and small sample performance of MoLC notably for the generalized gamma and K families of distributions. Supervised image classification experiments are considered for medical ultrasound and remote-sensing SAR imagery. The obtained results suggest that MoLC is a feasible and computationally fast yet not universally applicable alternative to MoM. MoLC becomes especially useful when the direct ML approach turns out to be unfeasible. © 1992-2012 IEEE.",

Focusing on the applicative problem of land-cover mapping from very-high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing images, which is a relevant problem in many applications of environmental monitoring and natural resource exploitation, Markov models convey a great potential, thanks to their capability to effectively describe and incorporate the spatial information associated with image data into an image-classification process.

      "abstract": "In the framework of remote-sensing image classification, support vector machines (SVMs) have lately been receiving substantial attention due to their accurate results in many applications as well as their remarkable generalization capability even with high-dimensional input data. However, SVM classifiers are intrinsically noncontextual, which represents an important limitation in image classification. In this paper, a novel and rigorous framework, which integrates SVMs and Markov random field models in a unique formulation for spatial contextual classification, is proposed. The developed contextual generalization of SVMs, is obtained by analytically relating the Markovian minimum-energy criterion to the application of an SVM in a suitably transformed space. Furthermore, as a second contribution, a novel contextual classifier is developed in the proposed general framework. Two specific algorithms, based on the Ho-Kashyap and Powell numerical procedures, are combined with this classifier to automate the estimation of its parameters. Experiments are carried out with hyperspectral, multichannel synthetic aperture radar, and multispectral high-resolution images and the behavior of the method as a function of the training-set size is assessed. © 2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The recent and forthcoming availability of high spatial resolution imagery from satellite and airborne sensors offers the possibility to generate an increasing number of remote sensing products and opens new promising opportunities for multi-sensor classification. Data fusion strategies, applied to modern airborne Earth observation systems, including hyperspectral MIVIS, color-infrared ADS40, and LiDAR sensors, are explored in this paper for fine-scale mapping of heterogeneous urban/rural landscapes. An over 1000-element array of supervised classification results is generated by varying the underlying classification algorithm (Maximum Likelihood/Spectral Angle Mapper/Spectral Information Divergence), the remote sensing data stack (different multi-sensor data combination), and the set of hyperspectral channels used for classification (feature selection). The analysis focuses on the identification of the best performing data fusion configuration and investigates sensor-derived marginal improvements. Numerical experiments, performed on a 20-km stretch of the Marecchia River (Italy), allow for a quantification of the synergies of multi-sensor airborne data. The use of Maximum Likelihood and of the feature space including ADS40, LiDAR derived normalized digital surface, texture layers, and 24 MIVIS bands represents the scheme that maximizes the classification accuracy on the test set. The best classification provides high accuracy (92.57% overall accuracy) and demonstrates the potential of the proposed approach to define the optimized data fusion and to capture the high spatial variability of natural and human-dominated environments. Significant inter-class differences in the identification schemes are also found by indicating possible sub-optimal solutions for landscape-driven mapping, such as mixed forest, floodplain, urban, and agricultural zones. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel unsupervised, non-Gaussian, and contextual segmentation method that combines an advanced statistical distribution with spatial contextual information for multilook polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) data. This extends on previous studies that have shown the added value of both non-Gaussian modeling and contextual smoothing individually or for intensity channels only. The method is based on a Markov random field (MRF) model that integrates a K-Wishart distribution for the PolSAR data statistics conditioned to each image cluster and a Potts model for the spatial context. Specifically, the proposed algorithm is constructed based upon the stochastic expectation maximization (SEM) algorithm. A new formulation of SEM is developed to jointly perform clustering of the data and parameter estimation of the K-Wishart distribution and the MRF model. Experiments on simulated and real PolSAR data demonstrate the added value of using an appropriate statistical representation, in combination with contextual smoothing. © 1980-2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Change detection techniques represent important tools for environmental monitoring and damage assessment after environmental disasters. However, change detection methods that were found accurate for coarser-resolution SAR are often ineffective with current very high resolution (VHR) satellite SAR due to the need to suitably model the contextual and geometrical information associated with VHR data. In this paper, a novel unsupervised change detection technique is proposed for VHR SAR based on Markov random fields (MRFs), line processes, and a dictionary of SAR-specific probability density models. The estimation of the parameters of the proposed MRF model is carried out through the expectation-maximization algorithm and the method of log-cumulants. Graph cuts are used to minimize the energy function of the MRF model because of their capability to approach global minima or strong local minima in acceptable computation times. The proposed method is experimented with COSMO-SkyMed images acquired before and after an earthquake. © 2012 IEEE.",

The proposed classifier is based on an explicit hierarchical graph-based model sufficiently flexible to deal with multi-source coregistered datasets at each level of the graph. The suggested supervised method relies on a two-step technique. In the first step, a joint statistical model is developed for the input images that consists of the finite mixtures of automatically chosen parametric families for single images, and multivariate copulas to model joint class-conditional statistics at each resolution. As a second step, we plug the estimated joint probability density functions into a hierarchical Markovian model based on a quad-tree structure.

      "abstract": "The potential and limitations of the hyperspectral remote sensing MIVIS sensor (Multispectral Infrared Visible Imaging Spectrometer) in classifying heterogeneous landscapes are explored in this study. In order to quantify the discriminant information derived from selected MIVIS subsets we classified a monitored scenario by progressively increasing the feature space dimensionality. The hyperspectral subsets are defined through the Sequential Forward Selection algorithm, while mapping processes have been performed through the Maximum Likelihood, Spectral Angle Mapper and Spectral Information Divergence classifiers. Impacts of spectral bands on the overall classification accuracies and single land cover-scale reliability, as well as possible dimensionality effects (Hughes phenomenon) are investigated. The analysis is tested on a 20-km stretch of the Marecchia River (Emilia Romagna, Italy) by using MIVIS data acquired in autumn 2009 and 2010 for a 17-class mapping including complex urban/rural areas. For the considered dataset, the MIVIS sensor showed an equipment failure: of the nominal 102-band MIVIS dataset, only the first 24 bands, spanning within the 0.441-1.319. μm spectral range, were exploitable. Nevertheless, the available information provided valuable discriminant contributions in land cover mapping (Maximum Likelihood Overall Accuracy ∼85%) with encouraging reliability on mixed forests, croplands, and no-vegetated floodplain patterns, whereas riparian vegetation and urban zones exhibited low classification accuracies. The relationship between the spectral space dimensionality and the minimum training-set size that is necessary to achieve a given inter-class separability has also been experimentally investigated by progressively under-sampling the original training set. The maximum under-sampling factor that avoided a decrease in the overall accuracy turned out to be, at maximum, 15 for the considered data set. © 2012 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

The proposed supervised Bayesian classification method applied to histological (medical) optical images and to remote sensing (optical and synthetic aperture radar) imagery consists of two steps. The first step introduces the joint statistical modeling of the coregistered input images. For each class and each input channel, the class-conditional marginal probability density functions are estimated by finite mixtures of well-chosen parametric families. For optical imagery, the normal distribution is a well-known model. For radar imagery, we have selected generalized gamma, log-normal, Nakagami and Weibull distributions. Next, the multivariate d-dimensional Clayton copula, where d can be interpreted as the number of input channels, is applied to estimate multivariate joint class-conditional statistics. As a second step, we plug the estimated joint probability density functions into a hierarchical Markovian model based on a quadtree structure. Multiscale features are extracted by discrete wavelet transforms, or by using input multiresolution data.

      "abstract": "Satellite remote sensing missions devoted to Earth observation (EO) currently offer a unique capability to monitor the evolution of the Earth's surface by providing temporally repetitive views at the desired (global, regional, or local) spatial scale. This wealth of remote sensing data conveys a huge potential for preventing, monitoring, and managing natural or man-made disasters. Specifically focusing on flood risk, a successful exploitation of this potential requires not only accurate and reliable image-analysis methods to extract the desired thematic information, but also the ability to combine this information with physically based models of the observed processes. Therefore, a multidisciplinary approach combining remote sensing with geophysical sciences, such as, in this case, hydrometeorology, is fundamental. This combination of expertise allows, in particular, satellite data to be exploited within the different phases of flood risk reduction: risk assessment, prevention, mitigation, monitoring, and management. In this paper, we investigate the key issues involved in the exploitation of satellite data with special focus on the phases of the emergency and post-disaster damage assessment. To this end, the challenges and the methodological approaches involved in the multidisciplinary combination of image analysis and hydrometeorology are discussed with the purpose of guiding and optimizing the process of information extraction from satellite data according to the requirements of civil protection from floods. Experimental examples of a few relevant case studies are also presented. © 2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "With the launch of several planetary missions in the last decade, a large amount of planetary images has been already acquired and much more will be available for analysis in the coming years. The image data need to be analyzed, preferably by automatic processing techniques because of the huge amount of data. Although many automatic feature extraction methods have been proposed and utilized for earth remote sensing images, these methods are not always applicable to planetary data that often present low contrast and uneven illumination characteristics. Here, we propose a new unsupervised method for the extraction of different features of elliptical and geometrically compact shapes, such as craters and rocks of compact shape (e.g., boulders), to be used for image registration purposes. This approach is based on the combination of several image processing techniques, including watershed segmentation and the generalized Hough transform. The method potentially has application for extraction of craters, rocks, and other geological features. © 2011 IEEE.",

Wavelets are applied to the difference image to extract multiscale features, and Markovian data fusion is used to integrate both these features and the spatial context in the change-detection process. Expectationmaximization and Besag's algorithms are used to estimate the model parameters.

A novel probability density function (pdf) model of the dual-pol SAR data is developed that combines finite mixture modeling for marginal probability density functions estimation and copulas for multivariate distribution modeling. The finite mixture modeling is performed via a recently proposed SAR-specific dictionary-based stochastic expectation maximization approach to SAR amplitude pdf estimation. For modeling the joint distribution of dual-pol data the statistical concept of copulas is employed, and a novel dictionary-based copula-selection method method is proposed. In order to take into account the contextual information, the developed joint pdf model is combined with a Markov random field approach for Bayesian image classification. The accuracy of the developed dual-pol supervised classification approach is validated and compared with benchmark approaches on two high-resolution dual-pol TerraSAR-X scenes, acquired during an epidemiological study. A corresponding single-channel version of the classification algorithm is also developed and validated on a single polarization COSMO-SkyMed scene. © 2011 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "In this letter, we address the problem of estimating the amplitude probability density function (pdf) of single-channel synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. A novel flexible method is developed to solve this problem, extending the recently proposed dictionary-based stochastic expectation maximization approach (developed for a medium-resolution SAR) to very high-resolution (VHR) satellite imagery, and enhanced by introduction of a novel procedure for estimating the number of mixture components, that permits to reduce appreciably its computational complexity. The specific interest is the estimation of heterogeneous statistics, and the developed method is validated in the case of the VHR SAR imagery, acquired by the last-generation satellite SAR systems, TerraSAR-X and COSMO-SkyMed. This VHR imagery allows the appreciation of various ground materials resulting in highly mixed distributions, thus posing a difficult estimation problem that has not been addressed so far. We also conduct an experimental study of the extended dictionary of state-of-the-art SAR-specific pdf models and consider the dictionary refinements. © 2010 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Hyperspectral sensors accurately sample the spectral signatures of different land covers, thus allowing an effective discrimination of cover classes or ground materials. However, addressing a supervised classification problem with hundreds of features involves critical small-sample size issues. Moreover, traditional hyperspectral-image classifiers are usually noncontextual. In this paper, a novel method is proposed, that is based on the integration of the support vector machine (SVM) and Markov random field (MRF) approaches to classification and is aimed at a rigorous contextual generalization of SVMs. A reformulation of the Markovian minimum-energy rule is introduced and is analytically proven to be equivalent to the application of an SVM in a suitably transformed space. The internal parameters of the method are automatically optimized by extending recently developed techniques based on the Ho-Kashyap and Powell's numerical algorithms and the proposed classifier is also combined with the recently proposed band-extraction approach to feature reduction. ©2010 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "For detailed hydraulic modeling, accurate spatial information of riparian vegetation patterns needs to be derived in automatic fashion. We propose a supervised classification for heterogeneous riparian corridors with a low number of spectrally separate classes using data fusion of a Quickbird image and LIDAR data. The approach considers nine land cover classes including three woody riparian species, brush, cultivated areas, grassland, urban infrastructures, bare soil and water. The classical \"stacked vector\" approach is adopted for data fusion, while the nonparametric weighted feature-extraction method and the pixel-oriented maximum likelihood algorithm are used for feature-reduction and classification purposes, respectively. We test the approach over a 14-km stretch of the Sieve River (Tuscany Region, Italy). A one-dimensional river modeling is applied over the study reach comparing the results of a classification-derived hydraulic roughness map and a traditional ground-based approach. Despite the complex study reach, the classification method produced encouraging accuracies (OKS=0.77) and represents a useful tool to delineate application domains of flow resistance models suited to different hydrodynamic patterns (e.g., stiff/flexible vegetation). Hydraulic modeling results showed that the remotely derived floodplain roughness parameterization captures the equivalent Manning coefficient over 20 test cross sections with uncertainty distributions described by low mean and standard deviation values. © 2010 ASCE.",

Although many automatic feature extraction methods have been proposed for for remote sensing images of the Earth, these methods are typically unfeasible for planetary data that generally present low contrast and uneven illumination characteristics. Here, a novel technique for crater detection, based on a marked point process, is proposed. The main idea behind marked point processes is to model objects within a stochastic framework: They provide a powerful and methodologically rigorous framework to efficiently map and detect objects and structures in an image with an excellent robustness to noise. These methods are new and promising: They represent the last frontier of the stochastic image modeling. They have been used in different areas of the terrestrial remote sensing, but have not been applied to planetary image analysis yet. The proposed method for crater detection has many other areas applications. One such application area is image registration by matching the extracted features. © 2010 IEEE.",

However, SVM classifiers are intrinsically noncontextual, which represents a severe limitation in image classification. In this paper, a novel method is proposed to integrate support vector classification with Markov random field models for the spatial context, and is validated with multichannel SAR and multispectral high-resolution images. The integration relies on an analytical reformulation of the Markovian minimum-energy rule in terms of a suitable SVM-like kernel expansion.

      "abstract": "The aim of this work is the development of an unsupervised method for the detection of the changes that occurred in multitemporal digital images of the fundus of the human retina, in terms of white and red spots. The images are acquired from the same patient at different times by a fundus camera. The proposed method is an unsupervised multiple classifier approach, based on a minimum-error thresholding technique. This technique is applied to separate the \"change\" and the \"no-change\" areas in a suitably defined difference image. In particular, the thresholding approach is applied to selected sub-images: the outputs of the different windows are combined with a majority vote approach, in order to cope with local illumination differences. A quantitative assessment of the change detection performances suggests that the proposed method is able to provide accurate change maps, although possibly affected by misregistration errors or calibration/acquisition artifacts. The comparison between the results obtained using the implemented multiple classifier approach and a standard one points out that the proposed algorithm provides an accurate detection of the temporal changes. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",

The key idea of the proposed technique is to integrate a decision tree classifier (DTC) and a Bayesian unsupervised thresholding algorithm, aiming at a complete automation of the classification process. Given a classification problem, the DTC approach decomposes the problem in a suitable tree-structured collection of binary sub-problems, for which simple (e.g., threshold-based) decision rules can be defined. The proposed strategy, by adopting the tree classification, discriminates several snow-covered and non-snow-covered classes, by decomposing the related multi-class problem into a set of binary thresholding sub-problems involving the multispectral channels and the resulting normalized difference vegetation index and normalized difference snow index. Focusing on a critical node in the tree, a Bayesian approach is used to expresses the threshold-selection problem as the minimization of a functional related to the probability of classification error.

      "abstract": "In applications related to environmental monitoring and disaster management, multichannel synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data present a great potential, owing both to their insensitivity to atmospheric and Sun-illumination conditions and to the improved discrimination capability they may provide as compared with single-channel SAR. However, exploiting this potential requires accurate and automatic techniques to generate change maps from (multichannel) SAR images acquired over the same geographic region in different polarizations or at different frequencies at different times. In this paper, a contextual unsupervised change-detection technique (based on a data-fusion approach) is proposed for two-date multichannel SAR images. Each SAR channel is modeled as a distinct information source, and a Markovian approach to data fusion is adopted. A Markov random field model is introduced that combines together the information conveyed by each SAR channel and the spatial contextual information concerning the correlation among neighboring pixels and formulated by using energy functions. In order to address the task of the estimation of the model parameters, the expectationmaximization algorithm is combined with the recently proposed method of log-cumulants. The proposed technique was experimentally validated with semisimulated multipolarization and multifrequency data and with real SIR-C/XSAR images. © 2006 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Land and sea surface temperatures are important input parameters for many hydrological and meteorological models. Satellite infrared remote sensing is an effective tool for mapping these variables on regional and global scales. A supervised approach, based on support vector machines (SVMs), has recently been developed to estimate surface temperature from satellite radiometry. However, in order to integrate temperature estimates into hydrological or meteorological data-assimilation schemes (e.g., in flood-prevention applications), a further critical input is often required in the form of pixelwise error statistics. This information is important because it quantifies inaccuracies in the temperature estimate computed for each pixel. This letter proposes two novel methods to model the statistics of the SVM regression error on a pixelwise basis. Both approaches take into account the nonstationary behavior of the error itself. This problem has been only recently explored in the SVM literature through the use of Bayesian reformulations of SVM regressions. The methods proposed in this letter extend this approach by integrating it with either maximum-likelihood or confidence-interval supervised estimators. In both cases, the goal is improved modeling of the error contribution due to intrinsic random variability in the data (e.g., noise). The methods are experimentally validated on Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and Meteosat Second Generation-Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (MSG-SEVIRI) images. © 2006 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "In the context of remotely sensed data analysis, a crucial problem is represented by the need to develop accurate models for the statistics of pixel intensities. In this work, we develop a parametric finite mixture model for the statistics of pixel intensities in high resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. This method is an extension of previously existing method for lower resolution images. The method integrates the stochastic expectation maximization (SEM) scheme and the method of log-cumulants (MoLC) with an automatic technique to select, for each mixture component, an optimal parametric model taken from a predefined dictionary of parametric probability density functions (pdf). The proposed dictionary consists of eight state-of-the-art SARspeci fic pdfs: Nakagami, log-normal, generalized Gaussian Rayleigh, Heavy-tailed Rayleigh, Weibull, K-root, Fisher and generalized Gamma. The designed scheme is endowed with the novel initialization procedure and the algorithm to automatically estimate the optimal number of mixture components. The experimental results with a set of several high resolution COSMO-SkyMed images demonstrate the high accuracy of the designed algorithm, both from the viewpoint of a visual comparison of the histograms, and from the viewpoint of quantitive accuracy measures such as correlation coefficient (above 99,5%). The method proves to be effective on all the considered images, remaining accurate for multimodal and highly heterogeneous scenes. © 2009 SPIE.",

      "abstract": "Land surface temperature (LST) and sea surface temperature (SST) are important quantities for many environmental models. Remote sensing is a source of information for their estimation on both regional and global scales. Many algorithms have been devised to estimate LST and SST from satellite data, most of which require a priori information about the surface and the atmosphere. A recently proposed approach involves the use of support vector machines (SVMs). Based on satellite data and corresponding in situ measurements, they generate an approximation of the relation between them, which can subsequently be used to estimate unknown surface temperatures from additional satellite data. Such a strategy requires the user to set several internal parameters. In this paper, a method is proposed for automatically setting these parameters to quasi-optimal values in the sense of minimum estimation errors. This is achieved by minimizing a functional correlated to regression errors (i.e., the span-bound upper bound on the leave-one-out (LOO) error) which can be computed by using only the training set, without need for a further validation set. In order to minimize this functional, Powell's algorithm is adopted, since it is applicable also to nondifferentiable functions. Experimental results yielded by the proposed method are similar in accuracy to those achieved by cross-validation and by a grid search for the parameter configuration which yields the best test-set accuracy. However, the proposed method gives a dramatic reduction in the computational time required, particularly when many training samples are available. © 2006 IEEE.",

As changes to detect can have various sizes and intensities which are a priori unknown in most applications, we propose a multiscale approach without considering any a priori information. Using multiscale series of a cumulant-based Kullback-Leibler divergence (CKLD) measure computed between two dates, changes are characterized as areas where the CKLD values vary a lot when the scale varies. In a probabilistic a-contrario framework, a measure of meaningfulness of such an evolution through scale is derived, leading to a criterion free of parameter.

      "abstract": "The aim of the presented study is the development of an automatic method for change detection in multitemporal digital images of the human retina. The images are acquired from the same patient at different times by a color fundus camera. The method proposed here is based on the preliminary automatic registration of multitemporal images, and the detection of the changes that can occur in the retina during time, by comparing the registered images. In order to achieve the temporal registration of the retinal images, an automatic approach based on global optimization techniques is proposed here. In particular, in order to estimate the optimum transformation between the input and the base image, a genetic algorithm is used to optimize the match between previously extracted maps of curvilinear structures in the images to be registered (such structures being represented by the vessels in the human retina). The proposed approach for the detection of temporal changes within the registered images is based on the application of an unsupervised algorithm, in order to cope with the lack of training information about the statistic of the changed areas in fundus images. The algorithm is tested on color fundus images with small and large changes. The comparison between the registered images using the implemented method and a manual one points out that the proposed algorithm provides an accurate registration. The image registration is not possible only when dealing with images taken from very different view-points. The analysis of the change-detection performances by a human expert suggests that the method is able to provide accurate change maps, when registration is successful. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.",

      "abstract": "In the contexts of environmental monitoring and disaster management, techniques allowing one to detect the changes that occurred in a given area between successive acquisition dates may serve as efficient data-analysis tools. Good discrimination between changed and unchanged areas can often be achieved by analyzing optical multispectral data in the related multidimensional feature space [20][43]. However, such data are affected by atmospheric and sun-illumination conditions. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) [15][27][34] is insensitive to such issues, hence, multitemporal SAR imagery is expected to play an important role, for instance, in ecological applications [18] or in disaster assessment and prevention [11][42]. However, SAR usually allows only one amplitude/ intensity observation, thus possibly resulting in poor discrimination. Multichannel (i.e., multipolarization and/or multifrequency) SAR represents an option with improved potential: as compared with single-channel SAR, it is expected to provide an increased discrimination capability, while maintaining its insensitivity to atmospheric and illumination issues. This potential is also reinforced by the availability of multichannel SAR data with short revisit times which are granted by future missions (e.g., COSMO/SkyMed and TerraSAR). © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

      "abstract": "A new preprocessing technique is presented in this paper to automatically highlight changes in multitemporal strongly heterogeneous remotely sensed images. The proposed technique is devoted to the case where the two acquisitions, before and after a given event, are significantly different, due, for instance, to different sensors, acquisition modalities, or climatic conditions. In a previous study, it was proven that the local statistics of the images acquired at the two dates could be used to extract a relevant change indicator. Nevertheless, this measure is valid when the two observations have been derived from similar acquisitions. When the acquisition modalities differ, local statistics tend to be too different from one image to the other one to be relevant in highlighting the ground evolution without mixing with the changes at ground. The technique proposed in this paper to overcome this limitation is based on the assumption that some dependence indeed exists between the two images in unchanged areas. This dependence is modeled by quantile regression applied according to the copula theory and used to perform an estimation of the local statistics that would have been observed if the acquisition conditions of the first image had been similar to the ones of the second image. The method yields an estimate of the local statistics of the first image through the point of view of the second one. Then, usual Kullback-Leibler-based comparisons of those statistics are applied to define a change measure, which may be analyzed (e.g., by thresholding) in order to detect changes. Experimental results are shown to validate the proposed method by using a pair of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images onboard European Remote Sensing (ERS) Satellite images and a pair of optical-SAR images (from the High Resolution Visible (HRV) sensor onboard Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) satellite and from ERS-SAR) acquired before and after a flood. © 2008 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Land surface temperature (LST) and sea surface temperature (SST) are important quantities for many hydrological and meteorological models and satellite infrared remote sensing represents a feasible way to map them on global and regional scales. However, in order to integrate temperature estimates nto data-assimilation schemes (e.g., in applications such as ood prevention), a further critical input is often represented by the statistics of the temperature regression error. A supervised approach, based on support vector machine (SVM), has recently been developed to estimate LST and SST from satellite radiometry. In this paper, two novel methods are proposed to model the statistics of the SVM regression error occurring on each image sample. This problem has been only recently explored in the SVM literature by developing Bayesian reformulations of SVM regression. The methods proposed in this paper extend this approach by integrating it with either maximumlikelihood or confidence-interval supervised estimators in order to improve the accuracy in modelling the error contribution due to intrinsic data variability (e.g., noise). ©2008 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Very high spatial resolution (HR) data provide plenty of detailed information about the ground on a regular basis for applications such as urban planning, precision farming, or damage assessment after environmental disasters. However, the complex nature of the HR observations, especially when acquired over urban/artificial environments, makes the accurate discrimination of distinct thematic classes a difficult task. In the present paper, a novel technique is proposed for supervised classification of multispectral HR images, that is based on the key-idea to combine the Markov random field (MRF) approach to data fusion with a graph-based approach to image classification in a multiscale strategy. A multiscale segmentation method is adopted in order to jointly exploit the capability to detect large structures in coarse-scale observations and to refine the identification of spatial details in fine-scale observations. Then, a novel MRF model is proposed that fuses the information conveyed by the segmentation maps at all scales and by the spatial neighborhood of each pixel. The method is validated by experiments on spaceborne and airborne HR images. ©2008 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to develop an automatic method for the registration of multitemporal digital images of the fundus of the human retina. The images are acquired from the same patient at different times by a color fundus camera. The proposed approach is based on the application of global optimization techniques to previously extracted maps of curvilinear structures in the images to be registered (such structures being represented by the vessels in the human retina): in particular, a genetic algorithm is used, in order to estimate the optimum transformation between the input and the base image. The algorithm is tested on two different types of data, gray scale and color images, and for both types, images with small changes and with large changes are used. The comparison between the registered images using the implemented method and a manual one points out that the proposed algorithm provides an accurate registration. The convergence to a solution is not possible only when dealing with images taken from very different view-points. © 2008 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "A new preprocessing technique is presented in this paper to perform automatic change detection in multitemporal multimodal remotely sensed images, mainly Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) ones. This technique is dedicated to the case where the two acquisitions, before and after an major disaster, are different for some reason (different sensor, modality of acquisition or climatic conditions). A measure, based on the local statistics of the images between the two dates, has proved to be a relevant change indicator. Nevertheless, the measure is valid when the two observations have been acquired with a similar point of view only. When the modalities of acquisition differ, local statistics tend to be too different, from one image to the other, to be relevant to the ground evolution without mixing to the normal changes. The technique, that overcomes this constraint, is based on the assumption that some dependence exists indeed between the two images. This dependence is modelled by the copula theory and used to perform an estimation of the local statistics that would have been observed if the modality of the first image had been similar to the other. It yields an estimation of local statistics of the first image, through the point of view of the latter. Then, usual comparison of those statistics may be applied to perform change detection. Some results are shown on a pair of ERS images and pairs of SPOT/ERS acquired before and after a flood. © 2007 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Land surface temperature (LST) and sea surface temperature (SST) are important quantities for many environmental models, and remote sensing is a feasible and promising way to estimate them on a regional and global scale. In order to estimate LST and SST from satellite data many algorithms have been devised, most of which require a-priori information about the surface and the atmosphere. However, the high variability of surface and atmospheric parameters causes these traditional methods to produce significant estimation errors, thus making their application on a global scale critical. A recently proposed approach involves the use of support vector machines (SVMs). Based on satellite data and corresponding in-situ measurements, they generate an approximation of the relation between them, which can be used subsequently to estimate unknown surface temperatures for additional satellite data. Such a strategy requires the user to set several internal parameters. In this paper a method is proposed for automatically setting these parameters to values that lead to minimum estimation errors. This is achieved by minimizing a functional correlated to regression errors (i.e., the \"span-bound\" upper bound on the leave-one-out error) which can be computed using only the training set, without the need for a further validation set. In order to minimize this functional, the Powell's algorithm is used, because it is applicable also to nondifferentiable functions. Experimental results generated by the proposed method turn out to be very similar to those obtained by cross-validation and by a grid search for the parameter configuration yielding the best test-set accuracy, although with a dramatic reduction in the computational times.",

The usefulness of the method, designed to be a simple and robust supervised classification tool, is assessed on real data, characterized by classes with very similar spectral responses, and limited amount of ground truth labeled training samples. The method is inspired by the framework of the Random Forests method proposed by Breiman (2001). The success of the method relies on the use of support vector machines (SVMs) as base classifiers, the freedom of random selection of input features to create diversity in the ensemble, and the use of the weighted majority voting scheme to combine classification results. Although not fully optimized, a simple and feasible solution is adopted for tuning the SVM parameters of the base classifiers, aiming its use in practical applications. Moreover, the effect of an additional pre-processing module for an initial feature reduction is investigated. Encouraging results suggest the proposed method as promising, in addition to being easy to implement.",

      "abstract": "Several Earth observation satellites acquire images with different spatial resolutions, e.g., a panchromatic band with high resolution, and spectral bands with lower resolution. Likewise, we often face the problem of the presence of different resolutions when performing joint analyses of images acquired by different satellites. This paper presents a methods for unsupervised change detection of multiresolution images. The approach is based on the concept of a reference resolution, corresponding to the highest resolution in the dataset. The spatial relationships between the class labels are specified through a Markov random field model defined at the reference resolution. Data at coarser scales are modelled as mixed pixels by relating the observations to the classes at the reference resolution. A Bayesian framework for classification based on this multiscale model is adopted. The classification is performed by an \"iterative conditional modes\" (ICM) algorithm. A computationally efficient scheme for parameter estimation based on a combination of the ICM and of the expectation-maximization algorithm is used. Results obtained on real satellite images are presented. © 2007 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes a procedure to extract spectral channels of variable bandwidths and spectral positions from the hyperspectral image in such a way as to optimize the accuracy for a specific classification problem. In particular, each spectral channel (\"s-band\") is obtained by averaging a group of contiguous channels of the hyperspectral image (\"h-bands\"). Therefore, if one wants to define m s-bands, the problem can be formulated as the optimization of the related m starting and m ending h-bands. Toward this end, we propose to adopt, as an optimization criterion, an interclass distance computed on a training set and to generate a sequence of possible solutions by one of three possible search strategies. As the proposed formalization of the problem makes it analogous to a feature-selection problem, the proposed three strategies have been derived by modifying three feature-selection strategies, namely 1) the \"sequential forward selection,\" 2) the \"steepest ascent,\" and 3) the \"fast constrained search.\" Experimental results on a well-known hyperspectral data set confirm the effectiveness of the approach, which yields better results than other widely used methods. The importance of this kind of procedure lies in feature reduction for hyperspectral image classification or in the case-based design of the spectral bands of a programmable sensor. It represents a special case of feature extraction that is expected to be more powerful than feature selection. The kind of transformation used allows the interpretability of the new features (i.e., the spectral bands) to be saved. © 2007 IEEE.",

In particular, the use of a global model for the statistical dependence of all the image pixels in a given image-analysis scheme typically turns out to be an intractable task. The MRF approach offers a solution to this issue, as it allows expressing a global model of the contextual information by using only local relations among neighboring pixels [2]. Specifically, due to the HammersleyClifford theorem [3], a large class of global contextual models (i.e., the Gibbs random fields, GRFs [2]) can be proved to be equivalent to local MRFs, thus sharply reducing the related model complexity. In particular, MRFs have been used for remote-sensing image analysis, for single-date [5], multi-temporal [6-8], multi-source [9], and multi-resolution [10] classification, for denoising [1], segmentation [11-14], anomaly detection [15], texture extraction [2,13,16], and change detection [17-19].",

In addition, the short revisit time provided by future SAR-based missions will allow a huge amount of multitemporal SAR data to become systematically available for monitoring applications. In this paper, the problem of detecting the changes that occurred on the ground by analyzing SAR imagery is addressed by a completely unsupervised approach, i.e., by developing an automatic thresholding technique. The image-ratioing approach to SAR change detection is adopted, and the Kittler and Illingworth minimum-error thresholding algorithm is generalized to take into account the non-Gaussian distribution of the amplitude values of SAR images. In particular, a SAR-speciflc parametric modeling approach for the ratio image is proposed and integrated into the thresholding process.

      "abstract": "In the context of remote-sensing image analysis, Markov random field (MRF) models play an important role, due to their ability to integrate the use of contextual information associated with the image data in the analysis process, through the definition of suitable energy functions. However, especially when dealing with MRF models for supervised classification, the estimation of the parameters characterizing an MRF model is still an open issue, which is typically addressed by using time-expensive interactive \"trial-and- error\" procedures. In this paper, by focusing on a broad class of MRF models, in which the energy functions can be expressed as linear combinations of distinct contributions (e.g., representing different typologies of contextual interactions), an automatic supervised procedure for the optimization of the weight parameters of the combinations is proposed. Formulating the parameter-estimation problem as the solution of a system of linear inequalities, the problem is solved by extending to the present context the Ho-Kashyap algorithm, which is typically applied by the pattern-recognition community in computing linear discriminant functions for binary classification. The method is validated experimentally on three different (both single-date and multitemporal) datasets, which are endowed with distinct MRF models formalizing the spatial contextual information associated with a single remote-sensing image and/or the spatio-temporal contextual information associated with an image sequence. © 2006 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "In the context of remotely sensed data analysis, an important problem is the development of accurate models for the statistics of the pixel intensities. Focusing on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, this modeling process turns out to be a crucial task, for instance, for classification or for denoising purposes. In this paper, an innovative parametric estimation methodology for SAR amplitude data is proposed that adopts a generalized Gaussian (GG) model for the complex SAR backscattered signal. A closed-form expression for the corresponding amplitude probability density function (PDF) is derived and a specific parameter estimation algorithm is developed in order to deal with the proposed model. Specifically, the recently proposed \"method-of-log-cumulants\" (MoLC) is applied, which stems from the adoption of the Mellin transform (instead of the usual Fourier transform) in the computation of characteristic functions and from the corresponding generalization of the concepts of moment and cumulant. For the developed GG-based amplitude model, the resulting MoLC estimates turn out to be numerically feasible and are also analytically proved to be consistent. The proposed parametric approach was validated by using several real ERS-1, XSAR, E-SAR, and NASA/JPL airborne SAR images, and the experimental results prove that the method models the amplitude PDF better than several previously proposed parametric models for backscattering phenomena. © 2006 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Within remote-sensing image analysis, Markov random field (MRF) models represent a powerful tool [1], due to their ability to integrate contextual information associated with the image data in the analysis process [2,3,4]. In particular, the use of a global model for the statistical dependence of all the image pixels in a given image-analysis scheme typically turns out to be an intractable task. The MRF approach offers a solution to this issue, as it allows expressing a global model of the contextual information by using only local relations among neighboring pixels [2]. Specifically, due to the Hammersley– Clifford theorem [3], a large class of global contextual models (i.e., the Gibbs random fields, GRFs [2]) can be proved to be equivalent to local MRFs, thus sharply reducing the related model complexity. In particular, MRFs have been used for remote-sensing image analysis, for single-date [5], multi-temporal [6–8], multi-source [9], andmulti-resolution[10] classification, for denoising [1], segmentation [11–14], anomaly detection [15], texture extraction [2,13,16], and change detection [17–19].",

This technique is applied both to separate the \"change\" and the \"no-change\" classes in a suitably defined difference image, and to distinguish among different typologies of change. The algorithm is tested on 10 multitemporal pairs of images.

This paper deals with the problem of probability density function (pdf) estimation in the context of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) amplitude data analysis. Several theoretical and heuristic models for the pdfs of SAR data have been proposed in the literature, which have been proved to be effective for different land-cover typologies, thus making the choice of a single optimal parametric pdf a hard task, especially when dealing with heterogeneous SAR data. In this paper, an innovative estimation algorithm is described, which faces such a problem by adopting a finite mixture model for the amplitude pdf, with mixture components belonging to a given dictionary of SAR-specific pdfs. The proposed method automatically integrates the procedures of selection of the optimal model for each component, of parameter estimation, and of optimization of the number of components by combining the stochastic expectation-maximization iterative methodology with the recently developed \"method-of-log-cumulants\" for parametric pdf estimation in the case of nonnegative random variables.

      "abstract": "The use of remotely sensed imagery for environmental monitoring naturally leads to operate with multitemporal images of the geographical area of interest. In order to generate thematic maps for all acquisition dates, an unsupervised classification algorithm is not effective, due to the lack of knowledge about the thematic classes. On the other hand, a detailed analysis of all the land-cover transitions is naturally accomplished in a completely supervised context, but the ground-data requirement involved by this approach is not realistic in case of short rivisit time. An interesting trade-off is represented by the partially supervised approach, exploiting ground truth only for a subset of the acquisition dates. In this context, a multitemporal classification scheme has been proposed previously by the authors, which deals with a couple of images of the same area, assuming ground truth to be available only at the first date. In the present paper, several modifications are proposed to this system in order to automatize it and to improve the detection performances. Specifically, a preprocessing algorithm is developed, which addresses the problem of mismatches in the dynamics of images acquired at different times over the same area, by both automatically correcting strong dynamics differences and detecting cloud areas. In addition, the clustering procedures integrated in the system are fully automatized by optimizing the selection of the numbers of clusters according to Bayesian estimates of the probability of correct classification. Experimental results on multitemporal Landsat-5 TM and ERS-1 SAR data are presented.",

      "abstract": "In remotely sensed data analysis, a crucial problem is represented by the need to develop accurate models for the statistics of the pixel intensities. This paper deals with the problem of parametric probability density function (PDF) estimation in the context of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) amplitude data analysis. Several theoretical and heuristic models for the PDFs of SAR data have been proposed in the literature, that have been proved to be effective for different land-cover typologies, thus making the choice of a single optimal SAR parametric PDF a hard task. In this paper, an innovative estimation algorithm is described, that faces such a problem by adopting a finite mixture model (FMM) for the amplitude PDF, with mixture components belonging to a given dictionary of SAR-specific PDFs. The method automatically integrates the procedures of selection of the optimal model for each component, of parameter estimation, and of optimization of the number of components by combining the Stochastic Expectation Maximization (SEM) iterative methodology with the recently developed \"method-of-log-cumulants\" (MoLC) for parametric PDF estimation. Experimental results on several real SAR images are reported, showing that the proposed method accurately models the statistics of SAR amplitude data.",

      "abstract": "Purpose of this paper is to propose a procedure to extract, from a hyperspectral image, spectral channels of variable bandwidths and spectral positions in such a way as to optimize the accuracy for a specific classification problem. In particular, each spectral channel (\"s-band\") is obtained by averaging a group of contiguous channels of the hyperspectral image (\"hbands\"). If one wants to define n s-bands, the problem can be therefore formulated as the optimization of n starting and n ending h-bands. To this end, we propose to adopt as optimization criterion an interclass distance computed on a training set and to generate a sequence of possible solutions with one of three possible search strategies. As the proposed formalization of the problem makes it analogous to a feature selection problem, the three proposed strategies have been derived by modifying three feature selection strategies: the Sequential Forward Selection (SFS), the Steepest Ascent and the Fast Constrained Search. Experimental results with a well-known hyperspectral data set confirm the effectiveness of the approach, which allows better results than those provided by the SFS method for feature selection. A preliminary comparison suggests that the accuracy is very similar to that obtained by the DBFE feature transformation method. The interest of this kind of procedure can be for a case-based design of the spectral bands of a programmable sensor or for the reduction of the number of bands derived from a hyperspectral image. It represents a special case of feature transformation that is expected to be more powerful than feature selection. The kind of transformation used allows the interpretability of the new features (i.e. the spectral bands) to be saved.",

      "abstract": "A key-problem in dealing with multitemporal images of a given geographical area is the identification of the changes occurring between distinct acquisition dates. A complete map of the change typologies can be generated when training data are available for all observation dates, but this completely supervised context involves expensive requirements. On the other hand, a completely unsupervised context does not require any prior information but does not allow an analysis of the different typologies of change, since no class information is available at any observation date. In the present paper a contextual multitemporal classification and change detection algorithm is proposed, which deals with remotely sensed image sequences with ground truth information available only at one reference acquisition date. The method integrates clustering information with a two-stage contextual Markov Random Field (MRF) model for the spatio-temporal correlation associated to the sequence. The algorithm is validated on a multitemporal and multispectral real data set, acquired over an agricultural and urban area, and characterized by a large amount of changes between the observation dates.",

      "abstract": "The task of the analysis of hyperspectral data, due to their high spectral resolution, requires dealing with the problem of the curse of dimensionality. Many feature selection/extraction techniques have been developed, which map the hyperdimensional feature space in a lower-dimensional space, based on the optimization of a suitable criterion function. This paper studies the impact of several such techniques and of the criterion chosen on the accuracy of different supervised classifiers (the \"minima-distance-to-means\", the k-NN, and the Bayes classifier with Gaussian distributions). The compared methods are the \"Sequential Forward Selection\" (SFS), the \"Steepest Ascent\" (SA), the \"Fast Constrained Search\" (FCS), the \"Projection Pursuit\" (PP) and the \"Decision Boundary Feature Extraction\" (DBFE), while the considered criterion functions are standard interclass distance measures (Bhattacharyya, Jeffries-Matusita and divergence distances). SFS is well known for its conceptual and computational simplicity. SA provides more effective subsets of selected features at the price of a higher computational cost. DBFE is an effective transformation technique, usually applied after a preliminary feature-space reduction through PP. The experimental comparison is performed on an AVIRIS hyperspectral data set characterized by 220 spectral bands and nine ground cover classes. The computational time of each algorithm is also reported.",

      "abstract": "An unsupervised change detection problem can be viewed as a classification problem with only two classes corresponding to the change and no-change areas, respectively. Thanks to its simplicity, image differencing is a widely used approach to change detection. It is based on the idea of generating a difference image that represents the modulus of the spectral change vector associated with each pixel in the study area. To separate the \"change\" and \"no-change\" classes in the difference image, a simple thresholding-based procedure can be applied. However, the selection of the best threshold value is not a trivial problem. We investigate and compare several simple thresholding methods. The combination of the expectation-maximization algorithm with a thresholding method is also performed for the purpose of achieving a better estimate of the optimal threshold value. As an experimental investigation, a study area damaged by a forest fire is considered. Two Landsat TM images of the area acquired before and after the event are utilized to detect the burnt zones and to assess and compare the mentioned unsupervised change-detection methods. © 2002 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.",

      "abstract": "An unsupervised change detection problem can be viewed as a classification problem with only two classes corresponding to the change and no-change areas, respectively. Due to its simplicity, image differencing represents a popular approach for change detection. It is based on the idea to generate a difference image that represents the modulus of the spectral change vector associated to each pixel in the study area. To separate the change and no-change classes in the difference image, a simple thresholding-based procedure can be applied. However, the selection of the best threshold value is not a trivial problem. In the present work, several simple thresholding methods are investigated and compared. The combination of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm with a thresholding method is also considered with the aim of achieving a better estimation of the optimal threshold value. For experimental purpose, a study area affected by a forest fire is considered. Two Landsat TM images of the area acquired before and after the event are utilized to reveal the burned zones and to assess and compare the above mentioned unsupervised change detection methods.",

      "abstract": "Given a temporal sequence of remote sensing images, the difficulty to collect regularly in time ground truth information makes it important to develop automatic unsupervised change detection techniques. Due to its simplicity, image differencing represents a popular approach for change detection. To separate the \"change\" and \"no-change\" classes in the difference image, a thresholding-based procedure can be applied. However, the main weakness of an unsupervised change detection approach is the absence of prior information about the scene as it resorts to the spectral information, only, which does not allow the analysis of the typologies of changes occurring between the acquisition dates. In the monitoring of a given study area, the main problem is that the ground truth collection does not usually follow the image acquisitions at the different dates. However, it is easier to have at least one image for which the ground truth is available. In this paper, we propose a partially supervised change detection scheme that is based on the exploitation of the ground truth availability for at least one temporal image. A clustering algorithm is applied to both acquired images and a thresholding-based unsupervised change detection algorithm is applied inside each cluster of the second date image in order not only to identify the presence of changes but also to distinguish between different typologies of changes.",
