      "abstract": "A direct torque control (DTC) algorithm with synchronous modulation for high-power induction motors is presented in this paper. While maintaining the dynamic response and robustness of a PI-based DTC operating in the stationary reference frame, the proposed scheme is able to keep an integer PWM modulation ratio, adjusting the stator flux angle and the switching period at each control step so that the synchronicity condition is always satisfied. In this way, it is possible to achieve an improvement of the very low-frequency harmonic spectrum of the torque, in particular by reducing torque sub-harmonics. These represent one of the main problems associated with low-frequency modulation typical of high-power drives and their reduction allows to avoid drawbacks such as resonance and mechanical stresses. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated with experimental tests on a small-scale test bench.",

      "abstract": "A new topology of multi-input bidirectional DC-DC converters is proposed in this paper. The converter has a boost behavior, i.e., the output voltage is higher than the sum of the input voltages. This family of converters is particularly suited for hybrid energy storage systems, where different DC sources are connected together and where the output voltage is significantly higher than the voltage of a single storage. The proposed converter reduces the number of required switches, leading to higher efficiency and reduced complexity compared to traditional n-input converters. The new topology demonstrates superior performance by enabling higher efficiency with fewer components. A dedicated control, based on PI controllers, is provided to ensure stable operation under dynamic conditions. The effectiveness of the proposed solution is tested using experimental results on a four-input 20 A/100 V converter prototype.",

      "abstract": "The Vajo Salsone site is located at an altitude of 376m a.s.l. on the right slope of the Valpantena valley, in the Veneto Pre-Alps, north of the town of Verona. The site was discovered in 2017 during the construction of a truckable road. It is a small and narrow karst cavity filled with Pleistocene sediments that yield abundant Middle Palaeolithic artefacts and faunal remains, often coated by carbonate encrustations. The lithic assemblage shows the predominance of the Levallois method and is characterised by a large number of retouched elements, including foliated points. These artefacts, typical of the Late Middle Palaeolithic period in central and south-eastern Europe, make Vajo Salsone an exceptional case, as their recovery is rather sporadic west of the Balkan Peninsula and south of the Alps. The fauna is dominated by ungulates, the most abundant being the red deer followed by roe deer, chamois and elk. Among the carnivores, wolf is common, while fox and bear are rare. This fauna suggests an environment characterised by open glades and closed forests, with a discontinuous presence of alpine grasslands and wetlands. Taphonomic analysis of the bone surfaces is complicated by the presence of concretions on most of the remains, which also show a high degree of fragmentation. Post-depositional fractures are common, and weathering is light. Only cervid bones show anthropogenic modifications related to hunting and hominin exploitation such as cut marks, scraping, impacts and burnt modifications. Some long bone diaphysis bear marks testifying to the use of these fragments as retouchers for flint artefacts. Such use has been evidenced at other Middle Palaeolithic sites in the area. Furthermore, the good state of preservation of the occlusal surface enamel of the cervid teeth allowed us to carry out meso and microwear analyses which provided data on seasonality and site occupation. With regard to dental wear analysis, the red deer from Vajo Salsone had mesowear suggesting a mixed feeding and grazing diets, whereas microwear analysis showed that the individuals had a diet between mixed feeding and browsing. The taphonomic study of the site has been integrated by X–RFS analysis of the alterations occurred to the lithic artefacts, which include deep patination and the formation of calcareous crusts. All the data presented here are consistent with the hypothesis of a short-distance displacement of the material from a single archaeological deposit possibly related to human occupation during the warm season.",

      "abstract": "The problem of electrical parameters identification in complex systems, and in particular in electric railway traction systems, is considered. Parameters are determined by an indirect approach: only the terminal variables (voltages and currents and, impedance and admittance, which can be readily calculated) are measured and the per-unit-length electrical parameters are determined using a multiconductor transmission line model of the track section under test. It will be shown that some parameters cannot be measured directly, that they are not constant with frequency and that they may depend on other external conditions. An indirect method for parameters identification is proposed through an adaptive algorithm (AA), so that the calculated terminal variables match the measured ones. The AA is based on a genetic algorithm (GA) approach, with details on pattern generation (through mutation and recombination) and determination of the degree of fitness and, as a consequence, of matching and stop criteria. There is a general accordance with model previsions, within common variations of the most critical properties of the test track. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

      "abstract": "The problem of determination of the accurate distribution of the return current in AT (autotransformer) electric traction systems (supplied at 2 × 25 kV) for High Speed Railways is considered. The path of the traction return current flowing from the rolling stock axles back to the supply (i.e., substation) is composed of the traction rails and additional earth potential conductors. The overhead supply conductors in contact with the train pantograph are connected to a symmetrical circuit (the feeder) with the purpose of current balancing. This arrangement and its influence on current to earth are considered: the return current divides among rails (as signalling disturbing current) and earth, depending on the value of the electric parameters of the system and the earth and on the circuit arrangement and on the relative position of system devices. The amplitude (as a percentage of the total return current) of the disturbing current may be high enough to cause interference to signalling. This work investigates the behavior of the return current in AT electric railway systems, on the basis of a reference system for the variation of the most important electrical parameters. © 2005 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "A measurement campaign was carried out at Orte and S.Oreste dc substations along a high-speed trunk of the Italian railway lines. The results consist of H-field values measured at the two substations, inside the buildings (near the rectifier groups) and outside (in the area surrounding the high-voltage input line, the HV/MV transformers, and the rectifier transformers) for different load conditions during normal service. The goal of this work is to determine the H-field intensity at low and medium frequency at dc railway substations. The measurement results are post-processed to extract statistical properties (namely, average values, dispersion, and distribution histograms). This information may contribute to updating and integrating standards regarding dc substation electromagnetic environment and specific immunity tests for housed equipment.",

The study has been conceived in order to obtain a preliminary modelling of electromagnetic emissions due to dynamic interaction between catenary and pantograph which can be considered the source of the largest values of noise emission. The proposed sub-model of the electrical interaction between pantograph and catenary, implemented by using Matlab-Simulink<sup>R</sup>, is able to describe the complex phenomenon of pantograph current collection during both sliding and bouncing (in presence of electric arc). The electric arc, which is influenced by numerous and interactive variables, is not the only source of electromagnetic noise and it is demonstrated that also local mechanical irregularities, during real sliding phase without electric arc, can represent a strong source of noise emission. The model gives out, among many electrical variables, values of contact resistance which represent the interface between sliding contact model and line model. It also calculates the magnetic field surrounding the railway vehicle in function of the distance from the pantograph-catenary contact.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents some significant extension and analytical formalization of the knowledge on transient and steadystate short-circuit currents in dc traction systems. Electrical supply substations (ESS's) in modern metrorail and railway dc systems are equipped with 6- and 12-pulse diode bridge rectifiers. Large existing plants are equipped with 6-pulse converters, but the 12-pulse option is preferred in the design of new plants in the parallel configuration. Such a converter presents a good compromise between number and voltage/current rating of semiconductor devices, complexity and rating of transformers, de-side voltage ripple, and ac-side current harmonic content. In this paper, the author considers the features of 6- and 12-pulse conversion units in terms of transient and steady-state short-circuit currents on zero fault impedance. Accurate determination of the transient dc short-circuit current is important for correct rating and tuning of protection devices and power equipment (high-speed circuit breakers, isolator switches, switchgears, de-bus bars, etc.). An analytical solution of the short-circuit behavior is given for zero fault impedance currents: phase currents of the transformer, transient short-circuit dc current, approximate expression of the dc short-circuit current, and accurate expression of the steadystate dc short-circuit current. The general calculation method used in the paper is extensible to any conversion unit with a double secondary transformer. © 1998 IEEE.",

Identification of track parameters based on fuzzy techniques represents a promising approach since only approximate qualitative knowledge of the track component and ground material properties and their environmental variations will be required. Such a fuzzy model is described in this paper. The model has been calibrated using verified reference data derived by finite element analysis, and is accurate to less than 30% compared with the given reference data.",

Harmonic noise from traction drives and substations can excite resonances and produce overcurrent or overvoltage conditions at critical points in the network.

Several substation and locomotive filters are considered with a frequency-dependent traction line.

      "abstract": "In order to take into account the wide spreading of high power non linear loads continuously increasing harmonic pollution in the utility networks and the new directives regarding electromagnetic compatibility, accurate evaluation of harmonic distortion introduced by conversion systems is necessary both for new plants and for upgrading of existing ones. This paper presents a generalized model for harmonic analysis and its implementation on a Personal Computer. The proposed methodology can be defined as a deterministic approach operating in the frequency domain by means of an iterative algorithm and allows to obtain the harmonic content of the required currents and voltages in steady state conditions as well as the time waveforms of any relevant system variable. With respect to the time domain models this one eliminates the computation time necessary for the transient behaviour determination which is not required for harmonic analysis. In comparison with the frequency domain models it presents two main characteristics: an accurate frequency model for any natural commutation static conversion structure (comparable with the time domain static converters models) and no convergence problems for the iteration process. The results of the implementation of the algorithm are reported and discussed in the case of a significant power application: the twelve pulse bridge rectifier for 3 kV dc railway traction supply. A comparison with the results achieved by a time domain method is pointed out in terms of computation time and results accuracy.",

      "abstract": "In the past few years semiconductor technology led to the availability of power switches able to manage high voltage and high current. Today GTOs are rated up to 4500 V and 2500 A, so that they can be utilized for very high power applications (tens of MVV) in converters oriented to power control on transmission and distribution networks. Main requirements of a power conditioner suitable for the above applications are high conversion efficiency and low harmonic distortion of the output voltage and current. These two tasks are not normally compatible, as the first requires low switching frequency and the second the highest achievable. The stepped wave modulated voltage source inverter allows to obtain Very low harmonic content of the output voltage and current together with low switching frequency of the static devices (constant and equal to the network frequency). Several options are available for the realization of the stepped wave structures: in this paper the 12-pulse, the 18-pulse and the 24-pulse are taken into account. The harmonic distortion of the output variables is considered, together with the real and reactive power flow control capabilities,.",
