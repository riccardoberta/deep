      "abstract": "Modern photovoltaic (PV) systems face increasing cybersecurity threats due to their integration with smart grid infrastructure. While previous research has identified vulnerabilities, the lack of standardized datasets has hindered the development and evaluation of detection algorithms. Building upon our previously introduced Photo-Set dataset, this paper presents a benchmark evaluation of anomaly detection algorithms for PV cybersecurity applications. We evaluate three state-of-the-art algorithms (One-Class SVM, Isolation Forest, and Local Outlier Factor) across 12 attack scenarios, establishing performance baselines and identifying algorithm-specific strengths and limitations. Our experimental results reveal a clear detectability hierarchy. This work proposes a standardized benchmark for PV cybersecurity research and provides the industry with evidence-based guidance for security system deployment.",

      "abstract": "The increasing digitalization of power systems has revolutionized the functionality and efficiency of electrical protection relays. These digital relays enhance fault detection, monitoring, and response mechanisms, ensuring the reliability and stability of power networks. However, their connectivity and reliance on communication protocols introduce significant cybersecurity risks, making them potential targets for malicious attacks. Cyber threats against digital protection relays can lead to severe consequences, including cascading failures, equipment damage, and compromised grid security. This paper presents a comprehensive review of cybersecurity challenges in digital electrical protection relays, focusing on four key areas: (1) a taxonomy of cyber attack models targeting protection relays, (2) the associated risks and their potential impact on power systems, (3) existing mitigation strategies to enhance relay security, and (4) future research directions to strengthen resilience against cyber threats.",

To address these challenges, this paper presents the Security Operation and Event Management (SOEM) platform, a software designed to support Security Operations Centers (SOCs) in reaching full visibility of OT environments. SOEM integrates diverse log sources and intrusion detection systems, including logs generated by the control system itself and additional on-the-shelf products, to enhance situational awareness and enable rapid incident response. The pilot project was carried out within the funded project SOC-OT-IGE from the “Centro di Competenza Start 4.0” and is being developed in partnership with Ansaldo Energia and HWG Sababa. The validation has been conducted in a real-world pilot project. Thanks to the mapping to requirements for compliance with IEC 62443, the platform demonstrates its effectiveness through defined key performance indicators (KPIs). This work bridges the gap between IT-centric SOC methodologies and the specialized needs of industrial cybersecurity.",

Distributed Energy Resources are increasingly controlled by cloud platforms by using the public internet and this exposes them to cyberattacks; these attacks can cause severe issues to the power grid, and usually there are no automatic responses, but rather cyber defense is delegated to manual operations, despite the very rapid dynamics of the power system. This paper discusses the possibility of using cybersecurity functions in electrical protection as an attack-response tool, making them able to trip after the detection of an ongoing attack; these functions have the aim of guaranteeing the continuity of the power system under cyberattacks. The paper details this approach, provides a use case, and simulates the effects of the implementation of the proposed solution in the power system.",

Due to the unique operational demands of ICS environments, traditional IT security measures are often unsuitable. To address these challenges, we present our approach for enhancing cybersecurity in energy generation plants by correlating and consolidating alerts and logs from various monitoring devices, thereby providing real-time dashboards for anomaly and threat detection. The approach is based on the development of a platform that aids Security Operation Center (SOC) teams in monitoring operational technology within industrial networks. The paper outlines the functionalities of the platform, that will be developed within the 'SOC OT Impianti Generazione Energia' (SOC-OT IGE) project.",

      "abstract": "The integration of the Renewable Energy Directive II (REDII) into the legislation of European Union member states and the subsequent proliferation of Renewable Energy Communities (REC) has highlighted the need for software platforms to support the administrative, financial, and technical operations of these communities. However, the rise of RECs also introduces significant cybersecurity risks, including financial losses, privacy violations, and broader threats to the stability of the distribution grid. Despite these risks, RECs present a unique opportunity to address cybersecurity concerns from inception, ensuring that security measures are integrated into their design, thereby reducing the complexity and cost of later countermeasures. This paper proposes an IEC 62443-based framework for the secure-by-design development of RECs; after analyzing the risks, the paper proposes a set of guidelines for its mitigation, and validates the proposed approach showing how a REC that respects these guidelines would be compliant with the IEC 62443 standard.",

In the last past years, there have been remarkable advances in technologies for enhancing the security of electrical systems. Still, some systems shows severe vulnerabilities. One of them is represented by communication-based electrical protection. The present work analyzes vulnerabilities in such type of control networks. We analyze the attack models to communication-based electrical protection systems, discussing the impact of the implementation of IEC 62351 on these vulnerabilities. We also discuss possible countermeasures which can be useful to address the discussed vulnerabilities.",

      "abstract": "Critical Infrastructures (CIs) are sensible targets. They could be physically damaged by natural or human actions, causing service disruptions, economic losses, and, in some extreme cases, harm to people. They, therefore, need a high level of protection against possible unintentional and intentional events. In this paper, we show a logical architecture that exploits information from both physical and cybersecurity systems to improve the overall security in a power plant scenario. We propose a Machine Learning (ML)-based anomaly detection approach to detect possible anomaly events by jointly correlating data related to both the physical and cyber domains. The performance evaluation showed encouraging results—obtained by different ML algorithms—which highlights how our proposed approach is able to detect possible abnormal situations that could not have been detected by using only information from either the physical or cyber domain.",

Its application in the industrial systems sector may be essential also for the protection of critical infrastructures. Due to the huge amount of involved data and to their complexity the use of machine learning may be the clue. The basic idea is describing an industrial process by a series of key attributes whose measures (the features) compose a state vector including heterogeneous types of measurements. Each feature should be a key attribute which can help discriminate between a normal functioning condition and an anomaly. In this context, the paper presents the use of a deep neural network architecture called autoencoder to detect anomalies due to either system faults or cyberattacks. The chosen application field is a photovoltaic system connected to the grid. The results, even if preliminary, are really promising.",

      "abstract": "Through the combination of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Life Cycle Costing (LCC) in a dedicated toolbox, the aim of this paper is to evaluate both potential environmental impacts and potential costs of the operation of a 230 kW Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) system. LCA and LCC methodologies have been here applied for a comparison with a conventional technology, i.e. Micro Gas Turbine (MGT) for distributed power generation applications. A contribution analysis for the SOFC system fuelled with natural gas, reveals that the fuel supply is responsible of a relevant share of the environmental impact. The same system, fed with biogas, shows environmental benefits on global and regional impact categories, depending on the power energy mix used during the digestion process. For both SOFC and MGT systems, the life cycle hotspots are identifiable in the operation stage for the global warming category, and in the fuel supply stage for all the remaining impact categories. The LCA-LCC comparison between SOFC and MGT systems, based on a toolbox embedding a set of 8 sustainability indicators for decision making, shows that the SOFC system presents environmental and economic benefits in a life cycle perspective, particularly for household application. However, cost results to be the most sensitive bottle-neck for benchmarking with traditional energy systems. Therefore, the SOFC system is preferable to the conventional MGT technology when the sustainability of investment cost is demonstrated, whilst a wide advantage in environmental performance along the life cycle has been proved.",

The first step aims at performing an economical optimization, as it provides the active power set-point for the programmable units that minimizes the overall production cost. The second step is related to power quality issues (power factor correction or voltage support), as it produces in output the reactive power reference signal for all the devices under converter. Moreover, due to the presence of uncertainties in the electric and thermal load request and in the Renewable Energy Sources (RES) power production, an update forecasting logic is proposed that, applied at each time step of the optimization process, refines the forecast accuracy. The experimental validation performed on the SPM shows the efficacy of the proposed EMS in satisfying both the economic and the power quality objectives.",

Many plants are being commissioned and many others are in the design phase, both for mainland and submarine links. Ground/sea electrodes are normally used in such applications, either operated on a full time basis, or during partial failures of one pole of bipolar plants. Due to the adverse effects that stray currents dispersed by such electrodes may have in terms of corrosion to nearby structures, and to the growing concern for environmental issues, the design of sea electrode has to be defined with increasing attention.

      "abstract": "Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants are increasingly used, when feasible, as a mean to reduce fuel consumption and CO<inf>2</inf> emissions. The thermal and electrical production must be adapted to load requirements and must lead to the fulfilment of all the constraints imposed by energy saving regulations. As one of such requirements [a minimum \"fuel energy savings ratio\" (FESR)] is an integral constraint that can be evaluated only at the end of each year of production, during the design phase of the plant it is of the utmost importance to have a fast algorithm able to simulate and optimize the operating conditions of all the candidate CHPs configurations, as the non-compliance with FESR regulations may lead to loose significant tax discounts, and therefore make the investment less profitable. The paper describes a suitable algorithm and its application to the optimization of a real CHP site located in Italy; besides, this work has led, as a further step toward the optimized control of larger systems, to the introduction of an additional degree of freedom (\"on-off\" state of some machines) extending in principle the optimization procedure to multinode CHP plants. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Two hospitals were the subject of case studies: in fact such kind of public building is usually an ideal site for a CHP plant, due to its peculiar energetic loads. Results show that, carefully choosing the plant configuration, it is possible to achieve significant economic and fuel savings, consequently reducing CO<inf>2</inf> emissions.

      "abstract": "Purpose - To provide a detailed investigation about methods commonly used for the computation of high-frequency electromagnetic fields in the vicinity of obstacles that can reflect or diffract them. This is useful to create an elementary block that can be used to evaluate with a high accuracy the propagation of high-frequency electromagnetic waves in real urban environment. Design/methodology/approach - The approach is based on a realistic application of the asymptotic theory of the uniform theory of diffraction. Therefore, the effect of material roughness and its electromagnetic properties on the reflection are taken into account. Findings - Provides information about the mechanisms involved in electromagnetic field propagation in urban environment, and the relative importance of each one. Research limitations/implications - In urban environment the buildings obviously have finite dimensions. The diffraction equations examined in the paper are strictly valid only in the case of infinite wedges; therefore, the behaviour of real building edges has not been taken rigorously into account. Practical implications - A source of information for researchers interested in the development of a simulator for the electromagnetic propagation in urban environment. Originality/value - This paper is aimed at providing to researchers, in a more comprehensive way, all information needed for the study of electromagnetic propagation in an environment containing many close scatterers. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",

Such model is derived by a line frequency domain analysis carried out with a full-Maxwell approach, which provides both the line impedance matrix and the open-circuit overvoltages induced by the lightning. A procedure based on the so-called vector fitting technique is then used to put these latter quantities into a form suitable for a circuit simulator. An example of application of the developed model into the commercial electromagnetic code PSCADEMTDC is finally proposed and discussed.",

      "abstract": "The important EMC problem of the high-frequency electromagnetic field coupling to a single-conductor transmission line of finite length is considered. In particular, a general method to determine the current induced on the line subjected to a generic incident field wave is proposed. The governing integro-differential equation of the problem is solved by means of a numerical procedure based on a Fourier series transformation. It can be proved that the series in which the unknown of the problem, namely the current along the line, is developed converges to the exact solution and only few terms are needed. The proposed approach represents a more accurate alternative to the transmission line (TL) approximation, since it allows the removal of its typical limitations, namely assumptions about the absence of a common mode current and about the TEM (or quasi-TEM) propagation mode. Such assumptions determine restrictions on the maximum value of line height and width with respect both to the line length and to the minimum field wavelength. Numerical results obtained on a test line excited by a suitable electromagnetic pulse are compared with those provided by the numerical electromagnetic code (NEC) and a good agreement is highlighted.",

      "abstract": "The present work is about the development of automatic techniques for the optimisation of active shields for stationary magnetic fields. An active magnetic shield is basically made by a number of coils, fed itith suitably chosen currents. In this way a magnetic field as equal as possible to the disturbing one is generated. The resulting effect is the reduction of the disturbing field in the area of interest. To achieve reasonable results a stocliastic optimisation procedure lias been used to optimise the non linear part of the problem (i.e. the geometry of shielding coils); the linear part can be optimised on the fly in a much more straightforward way through the solution of a least squares problem. The stocliastic optimiser used is based on the very fast simulated reannaling (VFSR), allowing to get a good optimum mth a much reduced sampling of the objective function. It is used combining it with a deterministic optimiser (Nelder-Mead simplex method), to get a faster optimisation process as soon as the valley of the global optimum is located. Basically the VFSR has a different point generating function and a different cooling schedule with respect to the standard Boltzmann annealing, but the concept is clearly the same. © MCB University Press.",

      "abstract": "The adaptive finite element methods developed by the authors for a class of 2-D problems in computational electromagnetics are presented. The cases covered are: magnetostatic, electrostatic, DC conduction and linear AC steady-state eddy currents, both plane and axialsymmetric. Theory is developed in the linear case only, but the resulting methods are applied on a heuristic basis also to non-linear cases and prove able to cope with them. These methods make use of an element-by-element error estimation and two different h-refinement techniques to adapt meshes made up of first or second-order triangular elements. Element-by-element error estimation has two main advantages: it is well suited to cope with the intricate geometries of electromagnetic devices and, at the same time, very cheap from a computational viewpoint. The local error is estimated by approximately solving a differential problem in each element. Theory on which this error estimation method is grounded is developed in full details and the underlying assumptions are pointed out. The presence in electromagnetic problems of surface currents and interfaces between different materials poses new problems in the error estimation with respect to other applications in which similar methods are used. The h-refinement technique can be selected between the bisection method and the centroid method followed by a Delaunay step. Accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method is discussed on the basis of previous work of the authors and further numerical experiments. Applications to realistic models showing good performances of the proposed methods are reported. Copyright © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

For the error estimation in magnetostatics, each element is divided in three sub-elements using an edge element approach, whereas for electrostatic problems a subdivision using facet elements is used. The methods and the numerical techniques are described, comparisons with known solutions are performed, some examples of application in cases of practical interest are reported and the obtained results are briefly discussed.",

The proposed procedure combines mesh adaption, based on an \"a-posteriori\" error estimate, and deterministic optimization techniques. The use of an analysis module with mesh adaption capabilities gives the automatic design procedure a more stable behaviour in the evaluation of the objective function. In particular, one of the most important features of this strategy is to allow wide variations in dimensional parameters, with high accuracy. The procedure has been realized with a modified version of the VF/OPERA 2d code, realized by the authors, and an optimization technique, based either on the \"Response Surface\" or on the \"Pattern Search\" algorithm, interacting with the analysis code using parametric commands. © 1996 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "In the present paper a new A, V -A-Ψ formulation for transient quasi-static eddy current problems using V=0, instead of A·n=0, on conductor boundaries is proposed. This choice appears to be advantageous for the finite element solution of problems without any symmetry plane or involving curved boundaries, even though unsuitahle if the fields change very slowly. The differential formulation is carefully defined; the ways in which the Coulomb gauge is imposed and the existence and the uniqueness of the solution are discussed. A new method to obtain the symmetry of the final algebraic system is introduced. This symmetrisation technique leads to an indefinite system of algebraic equations with a peculiar structure, that led to the development of a special solver. The results are extremely encouraging, because the formulation is based on thorough theoretical basis, and it is fairly easy to impose the conditions on conductor boundaries. © 1994 IEEE",

However, to achieve a truly integrated manufacturing environment, it is necessary to integrate design activities into the structure.

      "abstract": "Electro-optical studies of the streamer initiation process using high magnification is performed to determine streamer shapes and dimensions. Using this information, the local electrical field is computed by means of a sophisticated computer code, named compell. A detailed description of several plausible primary streamer models and the numerical results obtained from the local field computations are reported. The results obtained show that the electric field in the immediate vicinity of the streamer tip is much higher than has been calculated or estimated earlier. The influence of the different shapes and dimensions of the modeled streamers on the electric field are shown and discussed. © 1988 IEEE",

      "abstract": "In this paper five methods for local error estimation in a finite element solution for adaptive meshing are analyzed. All these methods are “a posteriori”, single solution, element by element error estimators. The first two of them are based on the estimation of the first neglected term in the series expansion of the solution, the third one is based on the approximate solution of a local boudary value problem with hierarchical shape functions and the last two utilize a residual evaluation. All the above methods are described and implemented in a common environment and the results obtained in a simple test case are presented and discussed. © 1988 IEEE",

      "abstract": "Electrooptical studies of the primary streamer that is formed in the vicinity of an electrode as a result of charge injection suggest that it has a cylindrical shape. A field-computation computer code, COMPELL, is used to compute the electric field prior to charge injection is some streamer geometries suggested by the optical measurements. The combined results of the electrooptical studies and of the field computations are presented and discussed. The results indicate that the electric field in the immediate vicinity of the streamer tip is generally much higher than has been previously calculated or estimated. The calculations show that an ionization process produced by the field, postulated previously for secondary streamers, is equally operative in the earliest stages of primary negative-streamer growth up to 3 mu m in length. This may result from a shielding effect from the electrodes, which causes an increase in the local field until a given length is reached and the effect of the needle surface becomes insignificant. The computational results address in a preliminary fashion the influence of the shape of the streamer tip.",

To facilitate the parameter identification, an advanced data acquisition system, allowing an automatic analysis of film frames obtained by high-speed motion pictures of impurity particle motion, has been devised and built. The data acquisition system used to identify the parameters relevant to the particle-surface contact phase can handle particles down to the limits of optical systems, thanks to the notable improvements of the numerical techniques used for the elaboration of experimental data. This means that the systems can be considered a powerful tool for the analysis of field-enhanced particle motion in dielectric fluids. The application area is now wider since gaseous insulating systems, mainly using SF//6 , are now quite common and are strongly influenced by the presence of impurity particles. The procedures for frame analysis are described and the data obtained are reviewed, compared with previous results, and discussed.",

A new kind of uniform field electrode, which is thought to better suit the above criteria, is then presented. The procedure for the design of electrodes of given gap and uniform field area is fully described. The results obtained in extensive test series performed with three sets of electrodes of different uniform field area are briefly reported and discussed.

      "abstract": "A new class of reluctance machines has been developed and tested at the Electrical Engineering Dept. of the University of Genoa. The machine structure consists of a stator similar to that of an induction machine with two three-phase windings, 2p and 4p poles respectively (p integer), and of a rotor with p poles and no winding. The machine behaves like a typical reluctance machine. The two stator windings can be supplied with variable frequencies, giving the possibility of a continuous speed regulation. A remarkable performance is that, for p=1 and frequency 50 Hz for both windings, the machine has a 6000 rpm synchronous speed, as a “single pole” machine.

Analogously, in the area of finite element method a new procedure is presented allowing to obtain complete polynomial interpolation functions by minimization of quadratic continuity errors on the lower order derivatives not constrained to exact continuity.

From the point of view of practical application, the main features are based on an input processor allowing the input of data in a parametric form. Besides, procedures for optimization of integral and differential quantities and for profile optimization are implemented in the package.

To get results suitable for direct engineering use, a first group of tests was performed with IEC normalized spherical cap electrodes, investigating the statistical behaviour of breakdown strength as a function of gap setting and test conditions. A second group of tests was performed with cylindrical electrodes to get data on the amount of the area effect on the statistical features of breakdown, also as function of test conditions. Finally, a statistical analysis of the obtained data is performed and results are discussed. © 1982.",

      "abstract": "To allow a more reliable use of a previously developed computer model of the motion of impurity particles in a dielectric liquid under the action of a time-varying electric field, a sophisticated data acquisition system has been devised and built at the Electrical Engineering Department of the University of Genoa. The apparatus consists of an advanced optical system which allows a real time acquisition of the film frames. The images are then analysed, digitized and stored into an on-line computer by means of a fast memory processor. The data are then scanned by speecially developed software to collect the kinematic quantities necessary to evaluate model parameters. In the paper, the above apparatus is described, and first results of the automatic analysis are shown and compared with experimental results. Furthermore, some consequent improvements of the model are reported and discussed. © 1982.",

The analysis is performed on commercial quality liquid nitrogen in the millimetre gap range, to collect data on the reduction of performances with respect to the technically pure liquids in a range of gaps not too far from those of practical applications, and with normalized electrodes to simplify technical comparison with other dielectric liquids. With a specially developed apparatus several series of tests are performed, to get additional informations on the gap effect in the millimetre gap range, and a thorough investigation on the influence of stirring between tests is carried out. Finally, a statistical analysis of the obtained results is performed to get further hints also on the conditioning effect as well as on the influence of sample size, and all the obtained results are compared and discussed. © 1982.",

      "abstract": "The computation of the losses in superconducting wires requires the solution of electromagnetic problems with a complicated constitutive equation of the superconducting material, which is nonlinear with hysteresis, under time-varying conditions, Analytical and numerical procedures which can be found in the literature about this problem present a very limited application range and cannot be applied to cases of practical interest. In the paper a procedure is presented, by which most of the drawbacks are eliminated. The critical state model developed by Bean, Kim et a1 is used, in both the forms with constant critical current density and with critical current density function of the magnetic field. In this model the magnetic field penetrates the superconductor entering from the boundary by fronts. These fronts cannot reverse their velocity and represent interfaces with unknown geometric shapes. A package has been implemented to solve this problem, some example of field solution are given and the results are discussed. © 1982 IEEE",
